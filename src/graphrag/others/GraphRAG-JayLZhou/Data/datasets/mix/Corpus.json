Prithee, for this one time,\n Content thee with a visionary rhyme.\n\n 2.\n What hand would crush the silken-winged fly,\n The youngest of inconstant April's minions,                   _10\n Because it cannot climb the purest sky,\n Where the swan sings, amid the sun's dominions?\n Not thine. Thou knowest 'tis its doom to die,\n When Day shall hide within her twilight pinions\n The lucent eyes, and the eternal smile,                       _15\n Serene as thine, which lent it life awhile.\n\n 3.\n To thy fair feet a winged Vision came,\n Whose date should have been longer than a day,\n And o'er thy head did beat its wings for fame,\n And in thy sight its fading plumes display;                   _20\n The watery bow burned in the evening flame.\n But the shower fell, the swift Sun went his way--\n And that is dead.--O, let me not believe\n That anything of mine is fit to live!\n\n 4.\n Wordsworth informs us he was nineteen years                   _25\n Considering and retouching Peter Bell;\n Watering his laurels with the killing tears\n Of slow, dull care, so that their roots to Hell\n Might pierce, and their wide branches blot the spheres\n Of Heaven, with dewy leaves and flowers; this well            _30\n May be, for Heaven and Earth conspire to foil\n The over-busy gardener's blundering toil.\n\n 5.\n My Witch indeed is not so sweet a creature\n As Ruth or Lucy, whom his graceful praise\n Clothes for our grandsons--but she matches Peter,             _35\n Though he took nineteen years, and she three days\n In dressing. Light the vest of flowing metre\n She wears; he, proud as dandy with his stays,\n Has hung upon his wiry limbs a dress\n Like King Lear's 'looped and windowed raggedness.'            _40\n\n 6.\n If you strip Peter, you will see a fellow\n Scorched by Hell's hyperequatorial climate\n Into a kind of a sulphureous yellow:\n A lean mark, hardly fit to fling a rhyme at;\n In shape a Scaramouch, in hue Othello.                        _45\n If you unveil my Witch, no priest nor primate\n Can shrive you of that sin,--if sin there be\n In love, when it becomes idolatry.\n\n\n THE WITCH OF ATLAS.\n\n 1.\n Before those cruel Twins, whom at one birth\n Incestuous Change bore to her father Time,                    _50\n Error and Truth, had hunted from the Earth\n All those bright natures which adorned its prime,\n And left us nothing to believe in, worth\n The pains of putting into learned rhyme,\n A lady-witch there lived on Atlas' mountain                   _55\n Within a cavern, by a secret fountain.\n\n 2.\n Her mother was one of the Atlantides:\n The all-beholding Sun had ne'er beholden\n In his wide voyage o'er continents and seas\n So fair a creature, as she lay enfolden                       _60\n In the warm shadow of her loveliness;--\n He kissed her with his beams, and made all golden\n The chamber of gray rock in which she lay--\n She, in that dream of joy, dissolved away.\n\n 3.\n 'Tis said, she first was changed into a vapour,               _65\n And then into a cloud, such clouds as flit,\n Like splendour-winged moths about a taper,\n Round the red west when the sun dies in it:\n And then into a meteor, such as caper\n On hill-tops when the moon is in a fit:                       _70\n Then, into one of those mysterious stars\n Which hide themselves between the Earth and Mars.\n\n 4.\n Ten times the Mother of the Months had bent\n Her bow beside the folding-star, and bidden\n With that bright sign the billows to indent                   _75\n The sea-deserted sand--like children chidden,\n At her command they ever came and went--\n Since in that cave a dewy splendour hidden\n Took shape and motion: with the living form\n Of this embodied Power, the cave grew warm.                   _80\n\n 5.\n A lovely lady garmented in light\n From her own beauty--deep her eyes, as are\n Two openings of unfathomable night\n Seen through a Temple's cloven roof--her hair\n Dark--the dim brain whirls dizzy with delight.                _85\n Picturing her form; her soft smiles shone afar,\n And her low voice was heard like love, and drew\n All living things towards this wonder new.\n\n 6.\n And first the spotted cameleopard came,\n And then the wise and fearless elephant;                      _90\n Then the sly serpent, in the golden flame\n Of his own volumes intervolved;--all gaunt\n And sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame.\n They drank before her at her sacred fount;\n And every beast of beating heart grew bold,                   _95\n Such gentleness and power even to behold.\n\n 7.\n The brinded lioness led forth her young,\n That she might teach them how they should forego\n Their inborn thirst of death; the pard unstrung\n His sinews at her feet, and sought to know                    _100\n With looks whose motions spoke without a tongue\n How he might be as gentle as the doe.\n The magic circle of her voice and eyes\n All savage natures did imparadise.\n\n 8.\n And old Silenus, shaking a green stick                        _105\n Of lilies, and the wood-gods in a crew\n Came, blithe, as in the olive copses thick\n Cicadae are, drunk with the noonday dew:\n And Dryope and Faunus followed quick,\n Teasing the God to sing them something new;                   _110\n Till in this cave they found the lady lone,\n Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.\n\n 9.\n And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there,\n And though none saw him,--through the adamant\n Of the deep mountains, through the trackless air,             _115\n And through those living spirits, like a want,\n He passed out of his everlasting lair\n Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,\n And felt that wondrous lady all alone,--\n And she felt him, upon her emerald throne.                    _120\n\n 10.\n And every nymph of stream and spreading tree,\n And every shepherdess of Ocean's flocks,\n Who drives her white waves over the green sea,\n And Ocean with the brine on his gray locks,\n And quaint Priapus with his company,                          _125\n All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocks\n Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth;--\n Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.\n\n 11.\n The herdsmen and the mountain maidens came,\n And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--                     _130\n Their spirits shook within them, as a flame\n Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:\n Pigmies, and Polyphemes, by many a name,\n Centaurs, and Satyrs, and such shapes as haunt\n Wet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,                _135\n Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed.\n\n 12.\n For she was beautiful--her beauty made\n The bright world dim, and everything beside\n Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:\n No thought of living spirit could abide,                      _140\n Which to her looks had ever been betrayed,\n On any object in the world so wide,\n On any hope within the circling skies,\n But on her form, and in her inmost eyes.\n\n 13.\n Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle                _145\n And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three\n Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle\n The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she\n As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle\n In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150\n And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--\n A shadow for the splendour of her love.\n\n 14.\n The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling\n Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,\n Which had the power all spirits of compelling,                _155\n Folded in cells of crystal silence there;\n Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling\n Will never die--yet ere we are aware,\n The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,\n And the regret they leave remains alone.                      _160\n\n 15.\n And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,\n Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,\n Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint\n With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.\n It was its work to bear to many a saint                       _165\n Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,\n Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,\n And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.\n\n 16.\n And odours in a kind of aviary\n Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170\n Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy\n Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;\n As bats at the wired window of a dairy,\n They beat their vans; and each was an adept,\n When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175\n To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.\n\n 17.\n And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might\n Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,\n And change eternal death into a night\n Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,               _180\n Could make their tears all wonder and delight,\n She in her crystal vials did closely keep:\n If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said\n The living were not envied of the dead.\n\n 18.\n Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185\n The works of some Saturnian Archimage,\n Which taught the expiations at whose price\n Men from the Gods might win that happy age\n Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;\n And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190\n Of gold and blood--till men should live and move\n Harmonious as the sacred stars above;\n\n 19.\n And how all things that seem untameable,\n Not to be checked and not to be confined,\n Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;                     _195\n Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,\n And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;\n And other scrolls whose writings did unbind\n The inmost lore of Love--let the profane\n Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.                     _200\n\n 20.\n And wondrous works of substances unknown,\n To which the enchantment of her father's power\n Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,\n Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;\n Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone              _205\n In their own golden beams--each like a flower,\n Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light\n Under a cypress in a starless night.\n\n 21.\n At first she lived alone in this wild home,\n And her own thoughts were each a minister,                    _210\n Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,\n Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,\n To work whatever purposes might come\n Into her mind; such power her mighty Sire\n Had girt them with, whether to fly or run,                    _215\n Through all the regions which he shines upon.\n\n 22.\n The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,\n Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,\n Offered to do her bidding through the seas,\n Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,                     _220\n And far beneath the matted roots of trees,\n And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,\n So they might live for ever in the light\n Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.\n\n 23.\n 'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;                   _225\n 'The fountains where the Naiades bedew\n Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;\n The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew\n Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;\n The boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        _230\n Will be consumed--the stubborn centre must\n Be scattered, like a cloud of summer dust.\n\n 24.\n 'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--\n If I must sigh to think that this shall be,\n If I must weep when the surviving Sun                         _235\n Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me\n To love you till your little race is run;\n I cannot die as ye must--over me\n Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell\n Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'--            _240\n\n 25.\n She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well\n Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,\n And every little circlet where they fell\n Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres\n And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245\n Of sobbing voices came upon her ears\n From those departing Forms, o'er the serene\n Of the white streams and of the forest green.\n\n 26.\n All day the wizard lady sate aloof,\n Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,                      _250\n Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;\n Or broidering the pictured poesy\n Of some high tale upon her growing woof,\n Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye\n In hues outshining heaven--and ever she                       _255\n Added some grace to the wrought poesy.\n\n 27.\n While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece\n Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;\n Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--\n Each flame of it is as a precious stone                       _260\n Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this\n Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.\n The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand\n She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.\n\n 28.\n This lady never slept, but lay in trance                      _265\n All night within the fountain--as in sleep.\n Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;\n Through the green splendour of the water deep\n She saw the constellations reel and dance\n Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep                     _270\n The tenour of her contemplations calm,\n With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.\n\n 29.\n And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended\n From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,\n She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275\n Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel\n Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,\n There yawned an inextinguishable well\n Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,\n And overflowing all the margin trim.                          _280\n\n 30.\n Within the which she lay when the fierce war\n Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor\n In many a mimic moon and bearded star\n O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker\n In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--                 _285\n And when the windless snow descended thicker\n Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came\n Melt on the surface of the level flame.\n\n 31.\n She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought\n For Venus, as the chariot of her star;                        _290\n But it was found too feeble to be fraught\n With all the ardours in that sphere which are,\n And so she sold it, and Apollo bought\n And gave it to this daughter: from a car\n Changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                  _295\n Which ever upon mortal stream did float.\n\n 32.\n And others say, that, when but three hours old,\n The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,\n And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,\n And like a horticultural adept,                               _300\n Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,\n And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept\n Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,\n And with his wings fanning it as it grew.\n\n 33.\n The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305\n Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began\n To turn the light and dew by inward power\n To its own substance; woven tracery ran\n Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er\n The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310\n Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion\n Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.\n\n 34.\n This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit\n A living spirit within all its frame,\n Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.                      _315\n Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,\n One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit--\n Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame--\n Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought,--\n In joyous expectation lay the boat.                           _320\n\n 35.\n Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow\n Together, tempering the repugnant mass\n With liquid love--all things together grow\n Through which the harmony of love can pass;\n And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--                  _325\n A living Image, which did far surpass\n In beauty that bright shape of vital stone\n Which drew the heart out of Pygmalion.\n\n 36.\n A sexless thing it was, and in its growth\n It seemed to have developed no defect                         _330\n Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--\n In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;\n The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,\n The countenance was such as might select\n Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335\n Imaging forth such perfect purity.\n\n 37.\n From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings,\n Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,\n Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,\n Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere:                        _340\n She led her creature to the boiling springs\n Where the light boat was moored, and said: 'Sit here!'\n And pointed to the prow, and took her seat\n Beside the rudder, with opposing feet.\n\n 38.\n And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,        _345\n Around their inland islets, and amid\n The panther-peopled forests whose shade cast\n Darkness and odours, and a pleasure hid\n In melancholy gloom, the pinnace passed;\n By many a star-surrounded pyramid                             _350\n Of icy crag cleaving the purple sky,\n And caverns yawning round unfathomably.\n\n 39.\n The silver noon into that winding dell,\n With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,\n Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;                    _355\n A green and glowing light, like that which drops\n From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,\n When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;\n Between the severed mountains lay on high,\n Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.                        _360\n\n 40.\n And ever as she went, the Image lay\n With folded wings and unawakened eyes;\n And o'er its gentle countenance did play\n The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,\n Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,                 _365\n And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs\n Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,\n They had aroused from that full heart and brain.\n\n 41.\n And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud\n Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:                      _370\n Now lingering on the pools, in which abode\n The calm and darkness of the deep content\n In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road\n Of white and dancing waters, all besprent\n With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat                  _375\n In such a shallow rapid could not float.\n\n 42.\n And down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver\n Their snow-like waters into golden air,\n Or under chasms unfathomable ever\n Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tear                  _380\n A subterranean portal for the river,\n It fled--the circling sunbows did upbear\n Its fall down the hoar precipice of spray,\n Lighting it far upon its lampless way.\n\n 43.\n And when the wizard lady would ascend                         _385\n The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,\n Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--\n She called 'Hermaphroditus!'--and the pale\n And heavy hue which slumber could extend\n Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale                        _390\n A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,\n Into the darkness of the stream did pass.\n\n 44.\n And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,\n With stars of fire spotting the stream below;\n And from above into the Sun's dominions                       _395\n Flinging a glory, like the golden glow\n In which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,\n All interwoven with fine feathery snow\n And moonlight splendour of intensest rime,\n With which frost paints the pines in winter time.             _400\n\n 45.\n And then it winnowed the Elysian air\n Which ever hung about that lady bright,\n With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,\n Like a star up the torrent of the night,\n Or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         _405\n Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,\n The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,\n Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.\n\n 46.\n The water flashed, like sunlight by the prow\n Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to Heaven;                   _410\n The still air seemed as if its waves did flow\n In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven\n The lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro:\n Beneath, the billows having vainly striven\n Indignant and impetuous, roared to feel                       _415\n The swift and steady motion of the keel.\n\n 47.\n Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,\n Or in the noon of interlunar night,\n The lady-witch in visions could not chain\n Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light                  _420\n Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain\n Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite;\n She to the Austral waters took her way,\n Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,--\n\n 48.\n Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,              _425\n Which rain could never bend, or whirl-blast shake,\n With the Antarctic constellations paven,\n Canopus and his crew, lay the Austral lake--\n There she would build herself a windless haven\n Out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                   _430\n The bastions of the storm, when through the sky\n The spirits of the tempest thundered by:\n\n 49.\n A haven beneath whose translucent floor\n The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,\n And around which the solid vapours hoar,                      _435\n Based on the level waters, to the sky\n Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore\n Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly\n Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,\n And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.                       _440\n\n 50.\n And whilst the outer lake beneath the lash\n Of the wind's scourge, foamed like a wounded thing,\n And the incessant hail with stony clash\n Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wing\n Of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                _445\n Looked like the wreck of some wind-wandering\n Fragment of inky thunder-smoke--this haven\n Was as a gem to copy Heaven engraven,--\n\n 51.\n On which that lady played her many pranks,\n Circling the image of a shooting star,                        _450\n Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks\n Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are,\n In her light boat; and many quips and cranks\n She played upon the water, till the car\n Of the late moon, like a sick matron wan,                     _455\n To journey from the misty east began.\n\n 52.\n And then she called out of the hollow turrets\n Of those high clouds, white, golden and vermilion,\n The armies of her ministering spirits--\n In mighty legions, million after million,                     _460\n They came, each troop emblazoning its merits\n On meteor flags; and many a proud pavilion\n Of the intertexture of the atmosphere\n They pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.\n\n 53.\n They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen            _465\n Of woven exhalations, underlaid\n With lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen\n A dome of thin and open ivory inlaid\n With crimson silk--cressets from the serene\n Hung there, and on the water for her tread                    _470\n A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,\n Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.\n\n 54.\n And on a throne o'erlaid with starlight, caught\n Upon those wandering isles of aery dew,\n Which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not,               _475\n She sate, and heard all that had happened new\n Between the earth and moon, since they had brought\n The last intelligence--and now she grew\n Pale as that moon, lost in the watery night--\n And now she wept, and now she laughed outright.               _480\n\n 55.\n These were tame pleasures; she would often climb\n The steepest ladder of the crudded rack\n Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,\n And like Arion on the dolphin's back\n Ride singing through the shoreless air;--oft-time             _485\n Following the serpent lightning's winding track,\n She ran upon the platforms of the wind,\n And laughed to hear the fire-balls roar behind.\n\n 56.\n And sometimes to those streams of upper air\n Which whirl the earth in its diurnal round,                   _490\n She would ascend, and win the spirits there\n To let her join their chorus. Mortals found\n That on those days the sky was calm and fair,\n And mystic snatches of harmonious sound\n Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,                  _495\n And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.\n\n 57.\n But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,\n To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads\n Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep\n Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,                            _500\n Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,\n His waters on the plain: and crested heads\n Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,\n And many a vapour-belted pyramid.\n\n 58.\n By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,                             _505\n Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,\n Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,\n Or charioteering ghastly alligators,\n Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes\n Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510\n Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,\n Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.\n\n 59.\n And where within the surface of the river\n The shadows of the massy temples lie,\n And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515\n Like things which every cloud can doom to die,\n Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever\n The works of man pierced that serenest sky\n With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight\n To wander in the shadow of the night.                         _520\n\n 60.\n With motion like the spirit of that wind\n Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet\n Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.\n Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,\n Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined           _525\n With many a dark and subterranean street\n Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep\n She passed, observing mortals in their sleep.\n\n 61.\n A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see\n Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.                   _530\n Here lay two sister twins in infancy;\n There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;\n Within, two lovers linked innocently\n In their loose locks which over both did creep\n Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm                   _535\n Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.\n\n 62.\n But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,\n Not to be mirrored in a holy song--\n Distortions foul of supernatural awe,\n And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;                        _540\n And all the code of Custom's lawless law\n Written upon the brows of old and young:\n 'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife\n Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'\n\n 63.\n And little did the sight disturb her soul.--                  _545\n We, the weak mariners of that wide lake\n Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,\n Our course unpiloted and starless make\n O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--\n But she in the calm depths her way could take,                _550\n Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide\n Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.\n\n 64.\n And she saw princes couched under the glow\n Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court\n In dormitories ranged, row after row,                         _555\n She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--\n For all were educated to be so.--\n The peasants in their huts, and in the port\n The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,\n And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.            _560\n\n 65.\n And all the forms in which those spirits lay\n Were to her sight like the diaphanous\n Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array\n Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us\n Only their scorn of all concealment: they                     _565\n Move in the light of their own beauty thus.\n But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,\n And little thought a Witch was looking on them.\n\n 66.\n She, all those human figures breathing there,\n Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570\n The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,\n And often through a rude and worn disguise\n She saw the inner form most bright and fair--\n And then she had a charm of strange device,\n Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575\n Could make that spirit mingle with her own.\n\n 67.\n Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given\n For such a charm when Tithon became gray?\n Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven\n Wouldst thou have yielded, ere Proserpina                     _580\n Had half (oh!

{"context":"Passage 1:\nFriedrich von Berg\nFriedrich Wilhelm Bernhard von Berg, also von Berg-Markienen, (20 November 1866 \u2013 9 March 1939) was a German politician and chairman of the Secret Civil Cabinet of Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1918.\n\nBiography\nFriedrich von Berg was born on his family's estate of Markienen (today Markiny, Poland) to the Prussian Major Friedrich von Berg (1835-1888). After passing his Abitur, Berg joined the Prussian Army in 1885 and became the personal adjutant of Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia in 1888. He left service in 1892 and started to study law at the Universities of Breslau and Bonn, where he became a member of the Corps Borussia Bonn next to the later Kaiser Wilhelm II. After passing his exam, Berg worked at the local court of Bartenstein and in 1896 at Danzig. In 1899 he moved to Berlin, where he became an assessor. In 1903 he returned to East Prussia and worked as the head of the district administration (Landrat) of the Goldap district.In 1906 he became a member of the Geheimes Zivilkabinett (Secret Civil Cabinet), the Kaiser's personal office. In 1909 he became the Landeshauptmann of East Prussia and in 1916 he was promoted to Oberpr\u00e4sident of the Province of East Prussia. On 16 January 1918, Berg became the chairman of the Kaiser's office. He opposed peace negotiations to end World War I as supposed by Chancellor Max von Baden and had to resign on 11 October 1918.He returned to his estate in East Prussia, where he was the President of the provincial diet (Provinziallandtag) in 1919 and the old-Prussian East Prussian Provincial Synod in 1920. The same year, he became the chairman of the German Nobility Association (Deutsche Adelsgenossenschaft) which he remained until 1932.From 1921 to 1927 Berg was the Chief Representative of the House of Hohenzollern in their negotiations over the family's personal property with the Weimar German government (Cf. Expropriation of the Princes in the Weimar Republic).Berg died in 1939 on his estate of Markienen.\nPassage 2:\nLyon Cohen\nLyon Cohen (born Yehuda Leib Cohen; May 11, 1868 \u2013 August 17, 1937) was a Polish-born Canadian businessman and a philanthropist. He was the grandfather of singer\/poet Leonard Cohen.\n\nBiography\nCohen was born in Congress Poland, part of the Russian Empire, to a Jewish family on May 11, 1868. He immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1871. He was educated at the McGill Model School and the Catholic Commercial Academy in Montreal. In 1888, he entered the firm of Lee & Cohen in Montreal; later became partner with his father in the firm of L. Cohen & Son; in 1895, he established W. R. Cuthbert & Co; in 1900, he organized the Canadian Improvement Co., a dredging contractor; in 1906, he founded The Freedman Co. in Montreal; and in May 1919, he organized and became President of Canadian Export Clothiers, Ltd.  The Freedman Company went on to become one of Montreal\u2019s largest clothing companies.In 1897, Cohen and Samuel William Jacobs founded the Canadian Jewish Times, the first English-language Jewish newspaper in Canada. The newspaper promoted the Canadianization of recent East European Jewish immigrants and encouraged their acceptance of Canadian customs as Cohen felt that the old world customs of immigrant Jews were one of the main causes of anti-Semitism. In 1914, the paper was purchased by Hirsch Wolofsky, owner of the Yiddish-language Keneder Adler, who transformed it into the Canadian Jewish Chronicle.He died on August 17, 1937, at the age of 69.\n\nPhilanthropy\nCohen was elected the first president of the Canadian Jewish Congress in 1919 and organized the Jewish Immigrant Aid Services of Canada. Cohen was also a leader of the Young Men\u2019s Hebrew Benevolent Society (later the Baron de Hirsch Institute) and the United Talmud Torahs, a Jewish day school in Montreal. He also served as president of Congregation Shaar Hashomayim and president of the Jewish Colonization Association in Canada.\n\nPersonal life\nCohen married Rachel Friedman of Montreal on February 17, 1891. She was the founder and President of Jewish Endeavour Sewing School. They had three sons and one daughter:\n\nNathan Bernard Cohen, who served as a lieutenant in the World War; he married Lithuanian Jewish immigrant Masha Klonitsky and they had one daughter and one son:\nEsther Cohen and\nsinger\/poet Leonard Cohen.\nHorace Rives Cohen, who was a captain and quartermaster of his battalion in World War I;\nLawrence Zebulun Cohen, student at McGill University, and\nSylvia Lillian Cohen.\nPassage 3:\nBruno II of Isenburg-Braunsberg\nBruno II of Isenburg-Braunsberg was the Count of Isenburg-Braunsberg from 1210 until 1255.\nPassage 4:\nKaya Alp\nKaya Alp (Ottoman Turkish: \u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u067e, lit.\u2009'Brave Rock') was, according to Ottoman tradition, the son of K\u0131z\u0131l Bu\u011fa or Basuk and the father of Suleyman Shah. He was the grandfather of Ertu\u011frul Ghazi, the father of the founder of the Ottoman Empire, Osman I. He was also famously known for being the successing name of Ertokus Bey\u2019s son Kaya Alp. He was a descendant of the ancestor of his tribe, Kay\u0131 son of Gun son of Oghuz Khagan, the legendary progenitor of the Oghuz Turks.\nPassage 5:\nDiepold of Berg\nDiepold Count von Berg, also: Theobald, (c. 1140, \u2013 3 November 1190) was the 11th Bishop of Passau from 1172 to 1190.\n\nBiography\nDiepold von Berg was born around 1140 as the son of Diepold von Berg-Schelklingen and Gisela von Andechs. Both his older brother Heinrich and the younger Manegold played an important role in the history of the Diocese of Passau. His third brother, Otto II von Berg, was Bishop of Freising.\nDiepold was ordained priest on 10 June 1172 by Bishop Henry I of Gurk. On 23 November of the year, he was, at the urging of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (present at the ceremony), and with the consent of Pope Alexander III. New bishop of Passau. He thus succeeded the succession of his brother Heinrich von Berg.In 1178 he took part in the provincial synod in Hohenau at the Inn and traveled to Rome in 1179 to the third Lateran Council. Back at Passau he had been confronted to the fire of the city  in 1181, Diepold energetically sought the reconstruction of the cathedral and the residence.\nIn 1189, he accompanied Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa to the unsuccessful Third Crusade, and finally died in November 1190, together with six canons of the Passau Cathedral, during the siege of Acre in the camp near the city. Diepold was buried in the Holy Land.\nPassage 6:\nBruno von Porstendorf\nBruno von Porstendorf otherwise Bruno II of Meissen or Bruno II von Porstendorf (died 4 December 1228) was Bishop of Meissen from 1209 to 1228.\nIn older lists of the bishops of Meissen he is numbered as Bruno III because of the inclusion of an earlier Bruno II, who was a clerical error.\n\nLife\nAlong with the P\u0159emyslid Kings of Bohemia Bruno was one of the most active participants in the German settlement of Upper Lusatia. For one thing, this was the location of the majority of the estates of the bishops of Meissen; for another, Bruno was keen in this way to secure his power in Upper Lusatia against the inroads of the Bohemians.\nIn 1228 he was removed from his office by Pope Gregory IX, presumably because of his reckless behaviour, and died on 4 December in the same year. His body was buried in the crypt of the collegiate church in Bautzen, which he had founded himself between 1213 and 1218.\nIn 1225 Bruno dedicated the Chapel of St. George in the Matthias Gate in Ortenburg, Bautzen.\n\nNotes and references\nSources\nEnno B\u00fcnz: Der Mei\u00dfner Bischof Bruno von Porstendorf (1209\/10\u20131228).

He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad. But when Muhammad was eight years old, the very old Abd al-Muttalib became very sick and died at age 81-82 in 578-579 CE.\nShaybah ibn H\u0101shim's grave can be found in the Jannat al-Mu'all\u0101 cemetery in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nFamily tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim\nSahaba\nPassage 9:\nBruno II von Berg\nBruno II of Berg (German: Bruno II von Berg) (c. 1100 \u2013 1137) was the Archbishop of Cologne from 1131 until 1137.\nBruno II of Berg was a son of Count Adolf III of Berg.

He was educated at Dorchester Grammar School and as a student of New Inn Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 23 April 1651, and graduated B.A. on 23 January 1655, and M.A. on 4 July 1657. After his appointment as an evangelist, he preached at Melcombe Regis, Radipole, and other areas in Dorset. Never episcopally ordained, he was approved by Oliver Cromwell's Commission of Triers in 1658 and appointed Vicar of Winterborne Whitechurch.The report of his interview in 1661 with Gilbert Ironside the elder, his diocesan, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, shows him to have been an Independent.

After the Conventicle Act 1664 he continued to preach in small gatherings at Preston and then Poole, until his death at Preston in 1678.\n\nFamily\nHe married a daughter of John White, who was related also to Thomas Fuller. White, the \"Patriarch of Dorchester\", married a sister of Cornelius Burges. Westley's eldest son was Timothy (born 1659). Their second son was Rev.

A younger son, Matthew Wesley, remained a nonconformist, became a London apothecary, and died on 10 June 1737, leaving a son, Matthew, in India; he provided for some of his brother Samuel's daughters.\n\nNotes\nAdditional sources\nMatthews, A.

{"context":"\\section{Introduction}\nGiven a data set and a model with some unknown parameters, the inverse problem aims to find the values of the model parameters that best fit the data.  \nIn this work, in which we focus on systems of interacting elements,\n the inverse problem concerns  the statistical inference\n of the underling interaction network and of its coupling coefficients from observed data on the dynamics  of the system. \n Versions of this problem are encountered in physics, biology (e.g., \\cite{Balakrishnan11,Ekeberg13,Christoph14}), social sciences and finance (e.g.,\\cite{Mastromatteo12,yamanaka_15}), neuroscience (e.g., \\cite{Schneidman06,Roudi09a,tyrcha_13}), just to cite a few, and are becoming more and more important due to the increase in the amount of data available from these fields.\\\\\n \\indent \n A standard approach used in statistical inference is to predict the interaction couplings by maximizing the likelihood function.\n This technique, however, requires the evaluation of the  \n \n   partition function that, in the most general case, concerns a number of computations scaling exponentially with the system size.\n  \n  \n    Boltzmann machine learning uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute the gradients of the Log-likelihood looking for stationary points \\cite{Murphy12} but this method is computationally manageable only for small systems. A series of faster approximations, such as naive mean-field, independent-pair approximation \\cite{Roudi09a, Roudi09b}, inversion of TAP equations \\cite{Kappen98,Tanaka98}, small correlations expansion \\cite{Sessak09}, adaptive TAP \\cite{Opper01}, adaptive  cluster expansion \\cite{Cocco12} or Bethe approximations \\cite{Ricci-Tersenghi12, Nguyen12}  have, then, been developed. These techniques take as input means and correlations of observed variables and most of them assume a fully connected graph as underlying connectivity network, or expand  around it by perturbative dilution.  In most cases, network reconstruction turns out to  be not accurate for small data sizes and\/or when couplings are  strong or, else, if the original interaction network is sparse.\\\\\n\\indent\n A further method, substantially improving performances for small data, is the so-called Pseudo-Likelyhood Method (PLM) \\cite{Ravikumar10}. In Ref. \\cite{Aurell12} Aurell and Ekeberg performed a comparison between PLM and some of the just mentioned mean-field-based algorithms on the pairwise interacting Ising-spin  ($\\sigma = \\pm 1$) model, showing how PLM performs sensitively better, especially on sparse graphs and in the high-coupling limit, i.e., for low temperature.\n \n In this work, we aim at performing statistical inference  on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $XY$ spins, i.e., $\\sigma \\equiv \\left(\\cos \\phi,\\sin \\phi\\right)$ with $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi )$. The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model  \\cite{Potts52} where the phase $\\phi$ takes discretely equispaced $p$ values  in the $2 \\pi$ interval, $\\phi_a =  a 2 \\pi\/p$, with $a= 0,1,\\dots,p-1$. The $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p$ increases. For $p=2$, one recovers the Ising model, for $p=4$ the Ashkin-Teller model \\cite{Ashkin43}, for $p=6$ the ice-type model \\cite{Pauling35,Baxter82} and the eight-vertex model \\cite{Sutherland70,Fan70,Baxter71} for $p=8$.  \nIt turns out to be very useful also for numerical implementations of the continuous $XY$ model. \nRecent analysis on the multi-body $XY$ model has shown that for a limited number of discrete phase values ($p\\sim 16, 32$) the thermodynamic critical properties of the $p\\to\\infty$ $XY$ limit are promptly recovered \\cite{Marruzzo15, Marruzzo16}.  \nOur main motivation to study statistical inference is that these kind of models have recently turned out to be rather useful in describing the behavior of optical systems, \nincluding standard mode-locking lasers \\cite{Gordon02,Gat04,Angelani07,Marruzzo15} and random lasers \\cite{Angelani06a,Leuzzi09a,Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b,Marruzzo16}. \nIn particular, the inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media. \n\n\n      This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. \\ref{sec:model} we introduce the general model  and we discuss its  derivation also  as a model for light transmission through random scattering media. \n    In Sec. \\ref{sec:plm} we introduce the PLM with $l_2$ regularization  and with decimation, two variants of the PLM respectively introduced in Ref. \\cite{Wainwright06} and \\cite{Aurell12} for the inverse Ising problem. \n    Here, we analyze these techniques for continuous $XY$ spins and we test them on thermalized data generated by Exchange Monte Carlo numerical simulations of the original model dynamics. In Sec. \\ref{sec:res_reg} we  present the results related to the PLM-$l_2$. In Sec. \\ref{sec:res_dec} the results related to the PLM with decimation are reported and its performances are compared to the PLM-$l_2$ and to a variational mean-field method analyzed in Ref. \\cite{Tyagi15}. In Sec. \\ref{sec:conc}, we outline conclusive remarks and perspectives.\n\n        \\section{The leading $XY$ model}\n      \\label{sec:model}\n The leading model we are considering is defined, for a system of $N$ angular $XY$ variables, by the Hamiltonian \n \\begin{equation}\n  \\mathcal{H} = - \\sum_{ik}^{1,N} J_{ik} \\cos{\\left(\\phi_i-\\phi_k\\right)} \n  \\label{eq:HXY}\n \n  \\end{equation} \n  \n  The $XY$ model is well known in statistical mechanics, displaying important physical\n  insights, starting from the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n  transition in two dimensions\\cite{Berezinskii70,Berezinskii71,Kosterlitz72} and moving to, e.g., the\n  transition of liquid helium to its superfluid state \\cite{Brezin82}, the roughening transition of the interface of a crystal in equilibrium with its vapor \\cite{Cardy96}. In presence of disorder and frustration \\cite{Villain77,Fradkin78} the model has been adopted to describe synchronization problems as the Kuramoto model \\cite{Kuramoto75} and in the theoretical modeling of Josephson junction arrays \\cite{Teitel83a,Teitel83b} and arrays of coupled lasers \\cite{Nixon13}.\n  Besides several derivations and implementations of the model in quantum and classical physics, equilibrium or out of equilibrium, ordered or fully frustrated systems, Eq. (\\ref{eq:HXY}), in its generic form,\n  has found applications also in other fields. A rather fascinating example being the behavior of starlings flocks  \\cite{Reynolds87,Deneubourg89,Huth90,Vicsek95, Cavagna13}.\n  Our interest on the $XY$ model resides, though, in optics. Phasor and phase models with pairwise and  multi-body interaction terms can, indeed, describe the behavior of electromagnetic modes in both linear and nonlinear optical systems in the analysis of problems such as light propagation and lasing \\cite{Gordon02, Antenucci15c, Antenucci15d}. As couplings are strongly frustrated, these models turn out to be especially useful to the study of optical properties in random media \\cite{Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b}, as in the noticeable case of random lasers \\cite{Wiersma08,Andreasen11,Antenucci15e}  and they might as well be applied to linear scattering problems, e.g., propagation of waves in opaque systems or disordered fibers. \n  \n  \n  \\subsection{A propagating wave model}\n  We briefly mention a derivation of the model as a proxy for the propagation of light through random linear media. \n Scattering of light is held responsible to obstruct our view and make objects opaque. Light rays, once that they enter the material, only exit  after getting scattered multiple times within the material. In such a disordered medium, both the direction and the phase of the propagating waves are random. Transmitted light \n yields a disordered interference pattern typically  having low intensity, random phase and almost no resolution, called a speckle. Nevertheless, in recent years it has been realized that disorder is rather a blessing in disguise \\cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b}. Several experiments have made it possible to control the behavior of light and other optical processes in a given random disordered medium,  \n by exploiting, e.g.,  the tools developed for wavefront shaping to control the propagation of light and to engineer the confinement of light \\cite{Yilmaz13,Riboli14}.\n \\\\\n \\indent\n In a linear dielectric medium, light propagation can be described through a part of the scattering matrix, the transmission matrix $\\mathbb{T}$, linking the outgoing to the incoming fields. \n Consider the case in which there are $N_I$ incoming channels and $N_O$ outgoing ones; we can indicate with $E^{\\rm in,out}_k$ the input\/output electromagnetic field phasors of channel $k$. In the most general case, i.e., without making any particular assumptions on the field polarizations, each light mode and its polarization polarization state can be represented by means of the $4$-dimensional Stokes vector. Each $ t_{ki}$ element of $\\mathbb{T}$, thus, is a $4 \\times 4$ M{\\\"u}ller matrix. If, on the other hand, we know that the source is polarized and the observation is made on the same polarization, one can use a scalar model and adopt Jones calculus \\cite{Goodman85,Popoff10a,Akbulut11}:\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n E^{\\rm out}_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_I}  t_{ki} E^{\\rm in}_i \\qquad \\forall~ k=1,\\ldots,N_O\n \\label{eq:transm}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n  We recall that the elements of the transmission matrix are random complex coefficients\\cite{Popoff10a}. For the case of completely unpolarized modes, we can also use a scalar model similar to Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm}, but whose variables are  the intensities of the outgoing\/incoming fields, rather than the fields themselves.\\\\ \nIn the following, for simplicity, we will consider Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}) as our starting point,\nwhere $E^{\\rm out}_k$, $E^{\\rm in}_i$ and $t_{ki}$ are all complex scalars. \nIf Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} holds for any $k$, we can write:\n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\int \\prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\\rm out}_k \\prod_{k=1}^{N_O}\\delta\\left(E^{\\rm out}_k - \\sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\\rm in}_j \\right) = 1\n  \\nonumber\n  \\\\\n  \\label{eq:deltas}\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n\n Observed data are a noisy representation of the true values of the fields. Therefore, in inference problems it is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into account in a probabilistic way, \n rather than looking  at the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose parameters are unknown). \n To this aim we can introduce Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are the Dirac deltas in Eq. (\\ref{eq:deltas}).\n Moreover, we move to consider the ensemble of all possible solutions of Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}) at given $\\mathbb{T}$, looking at  all configurations of input fields. We, thus, define the function:\n \n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n  Z &\\equiv &\\int_{{\\cal S}_{\\rm in}} \\prod_{j=1}^{N_I}  dE^{\\rm in}_j \\int_{{\\cal S}_{\\rm out}}\\prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\\rm out}_k \n  \\label{def:Z}\n\\\\\n    \\times\n  &&\\prod_{k=1}^{N_O}\n   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\Delta^2}}  \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2 \\Delta^2}\\left|\n  E^{\\rm out}_k -\\sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\\rm in}_j\\right|^2\n\\right\\} \n\\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\n   We stress that the integral of Eq. \\eqref{def:Z} is not exactly a Gaussian integral. Indeed, starting from Eq. \\eqref{eq:deltas}, two constraints on the electromagnetic field intensities must be taken into account. \n\n  The space of solutions is  delimited by the total power ${\\cal P}$ received by system, i.e., \n  ${\\cal S}_{\\rm in}: \\{E^{\\rm in} |\\sum_k I^{\\rm in}_k = \\mathcal{P}\\}$, also implying  a constraint on the total amount of energy that is transmitted through the medium, i. e., \n  ${\\cal S}_{\\rm out}:\\{E^{\\rm out} |\\sum_k I^{\\rm out}_k=c\\mathcal{P}\\}$, where the attenuation factor  $c<1$ accounts for total losses.\n  As we will see more in details in the following, being interested in inferring the transmission matrix through the PLM, we can omit to explicitly include these terms in Eq. \\eqref{eq:H_J} since they do not depend on $\\mathbb{T}$ not adding any information on the gradients with respect to the elements of $\\mathbb{T}$.\n  \n Taking the same number of incoming and outcoming channels, $N_I=N_O=N\/2$, and  ordering the input fields in the first $N\/2$ mode indices and the output fields in the last $N\/2$ indices, we can drop the ``in'' and ``out'' superscripts and formally write $Z$  as a partition function\n    \\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\label{eq:z}\n && Z =\\int_{\\mathcal S} \\prod_{j=1}^{N} dE_j \\left(   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\Delta^2}} \\right)^{N\/2} \n \\hspace*{-.4cm} \\exp\\left\\{\n  -\\frac{ {\\cal H} [\\{E\\};\\mathbb{T}] }{2\\Delta^2}\n  \\right\\}\n  \\\\\n&&{\\cal H} [\\{E\\};\\mathbb{T}] =\n-  \\sum_{k=1}^{N\/2}\\sum_{j=N\/2+1}^{N} \\left[E^*_j t_{jk} E_k + E_j t^*_{kj} E_k^* \n\\right]\n \\nonumber\n\\\\\n&&\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad + \\sum_{j=N\/2+1}^{N} |E_j|^2+ \\sum_{k,l}^{1,N\/2}E_k\nU_{kl} E_l^*\n \\nonumber\n \\\\\n \\label{eq:H_J}\n &&\\hspace*{1.88cm } = - \\sum_{nm}^{1,N} E_n J_{nm} E_m^*\n \\end{eqnarray}\n where ${\\cal H}$ is a real-valued function by construction, we have introduced the effective input-input coupling matrix\n\\begin{equation}\nU_{kl} \\equiv \\sum_{j=N\/2+1}^{N}t^*_{lj} t_{jk} \n \\label{def:U}\n \\end{equation}\n and the whole interaction matrix reads (here $\\mathbb{T} \\equiv \\{ t_{jk} \\}$)\n \\begin{equation}\n \\label{def:J}\n \\mathbb J\\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}\n \\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\phantom{()}&-\\mathbb{U} \\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&{\\mathbb{T}}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\hline\n\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\phantom{()}& \\mathbb   T^\\dagger&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}& - \\mathbb{I} &\\phantom{()}\\\\\n\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}\\\\\n \\end{array}\\right)\n \\end{equation}\n \n Determining the electromagnetic complex amplitude configurations that minimize the {\\em cost function} ${\\cal H}$, Eq.  (\\ref{eq:H_J}),  means to maximize the overall distribution peaked around the solutions of the transmission Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\\Delta^2\\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''\n  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. \n  \n\n  \n  \n  Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \\eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\\imath \\phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \\textit{quenched} with respect to phases.\nThe first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \\cite{Popoff11}.\nWith \\textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\\mathbb T$.\nWe stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. \n\nIf all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices.\nFor instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal.\nOtherwise, if intensities are \\textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}),\nthey are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)} \\to J_{nm} e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)}\n  \\nonumber\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\\propto \\delta_{nm}$.\n  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{H}& = &  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\\imath (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)}  + \\mbox{c.c.} \n    \\label{eq:h_im}\n\\\\    &=&  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} \\left[J^R_{nm} \\cos(\\phi_n - \\phi_m)+\n  J^I_{nm}\\sin (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)\\right] \n  \\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$. Being $\\mathbb J$  Hermitian, $J^R_{nm}=J^R_{mn}$ is symmetric and $J_{nm}^I=-J_{mn}^I$ is skew-symmetric.\n\n\\begin{comment}\n\\textcolor{red}{\nF: comment about quenched:\nI think that to obtain the XY model, it is not necessary that the intensities are strictly quenched (that is also a quite unfeasible situation, I guess).\nIndeed eq (2) does not deal with the dynamics of the modes, but just connect the in and out ones.\nFor this, what it is necessary to have the XY model, it is that the intensities are always the same on the different samples\n(so that the matrix $t_{ij}$ is the same for different phase data). If the intensities are fixed, then they can be incorporated in $t_{ij}$ and eq (2) can be written just for phases as described. \\\\\n}\n\\end{comment}\n\n\n  \\section{Pseudolikelihood Maximization}\n  \\label{sec:plm}\nThe inverse problem consists in the reconstruction of the parameters $J_{nm}$ of the Hamiltonian, Eq. (\\ref{eq:h_im}).  \nGiven a set of $M$ data configurations of $N$ spins\n $\\bm\\sigma = \\{ \\cos \\phi_i^{(\\mu)},\\sin \\phi_i^{(\\mu)} \\}$, $i = 1,\\dots,N$ and $\\mu=1,\\dots,M$, we want to \\emph{infer} the couplings:\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\bm \\sigma  \\rightarrow  \\mathbb{J} \n\\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\n With this purpose in mind,\n in the rest of this section we implement the working equations for the techniques used. \n In order to test our methods, we generate the input data, i.e., the configurations, by Monte-Carlo simulations of the model.\n The joint probability distribution of the $N$ variables $\\bm{\\phi}\\equiv\\{\\phi_1,\\dots,\\phi_N\\}$, follows the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution:\n \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:p_xy}\n P(\\bm{\\phi}) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H\\left(\\bm{\\phi}\\right)}} \\quad \\mbox{ where } \\quad Z = \\int \\prod_{k=1}^N d\\phi_k  e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H\\left(\\bm{\\phi}\\right)}}  \n \\end{equation}\n and where we denote $\\beta=\\left( 2\\Delta^2 \\right)^{-1}$ with respect to Eq. (\\ref{def:Z}) formalism.\n In order to stick to usual statistical inference notation, in the following we will rescale the couplings by a factor $\\beta \/ 2$: $\\beta J_{ij}\/2 \\rightarrow J_{ij}$. \n The main idea of the PLM is to work with the conditional probability distribution of one variable $\\phi_i$ given all other variables, \n $\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}$:\n \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n\t\\nonumber\n   P(\\phi_i | \\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}) &=& \\frac{1}{Z_i} \\exp \\left \\{ {H_i^x (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})\n  \t\\cos \\phi_i + H_i^y (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}) \\sin \\phi_i } \\right \\}\n\t\\\\\n \\label{eq:marginal_xy}\n\t&=&\\frac{e^{H_i(\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}) \\cos{\\left(\\phi_i-\\alpha_i(\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})\\right)}}}{2 \\pi I_0(H_i)}\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  where $H_i^x$ and $H_i^y$ are defined as\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n   H_i^x (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})  &=& \\sum_{j (\\neq i)} J^R_{ij} \\cos \\phi_j  - \\sum_{j  (\\neq i) } J_{ij}^{I} \\sin \\phi_j \\phantom{+  h^R_i} \\label{eq:26} \\\\\n   H_i^y  (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})  &=&  \\sum_{j  (\\neq i)} J^R_{ij}  \\sin \\phi_j  + \\sum_{j  (\\neq i) } J_{ij}^{I}   \\cos \\phi_j \\phantom{ + h_i^{I} }\\label{eq:27}\n   \\end{eqnarray}\nand $H_i= \\sqrt{(H_i^x)^2 + (H_i^y)^2}$, $\\alpha_i = \\arctan H_i^y\/H_i^x$   and we introduced the modified Bessel function of the first kind:\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\nonumber\n   I_k(x) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} d \\phi e^{x \\cos{ \\phi}}\\cos{k \\phi}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n   Given $M$ observation samples $\\bm{\\phi}^{(\\mu)}=\\{\\phi^\\mu_1,\\ldots,\\phi^\\mu_N\\}$, $\\mu = 1,\\dots, M$, the\n   pseudo-loglikelihood for the variable $i$ is given by the logarithm of Eq. (\\ref{eq:marginal_xy}),\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n   \\label{eq:L_i}\n   L_i &=& \\frac{1}{M}  \\sum_{\\mu = 1}^M  \\ln P(\\phi_i^{(\\mu)}|\\bm{\\phi}^{(\\mu)}_{\\backslash i})\n   \\\\\n   \\nonumber\n   & =&  \\frac{1}{M}  \\sum_{\\mu = 1}^M  \\left[ H_i^{(\\mu)} \\cos( \\phi_i^{(\\mu)} - \\alpha_i^{(\\mu)}) - \\ln  2 \\pi I_0\\left(H_i^{(\\mu)}\\right)\\right] \\, .\n    \\end{eqnarray}\nThe underlying idea of PLM is that an approximation of the true parameters of the model is obtained for values that maximize the functions $L_i$.\nThe specific maximization scheme differentiates the different techniques.\n\n\n   \n   \n   \\subsection{PLM with $l_2$ regularization}\n   Especially for the case of sparse graphs, it is useful to add a regularizer, which prevents the maximization routine to move towards high values of \n   $J_{ij}$ and $h_i$ without converging. We will adopt an $l_2$ regularization so that the Pseudolikelihood function (PLF) at site $i$  reads:\n   \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:plf_i}\n  {\\cal L}_i = L_i\n  - \\lambda \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\left(J_{ij}^R\\right)^2 - \\lambda \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\left(J_{ij}^I\\right)^2  \n   \\end{equation}\n   with $\\lambda>0$.\n   Note that the values of $\\lambda$ have to be chosen arbitrarily, but not too large, in order not to overcome $L_i$.\n   The standard implementation of the PLM consists in maximizing each ${\\cal L}_i$, for $i=1\\dots N$, separately. The expected values of the couplings are then:\n   \\begin{equation}\n   \\{ J_{i j}^*\\}_{j\\in \\partial i} :=  \\mbox{arg max}_{ \\{ J_{ij} \\}}\n    \\left[{\\cal L}_i\\right]\n   \\end{equation}\n   In this way, we obtain two estimates for the coupling $J_{ij}$, one from maximization of ${\\cal L}_i$, $J_{ij}^{(i)}$, and another one from ${\\cal L}_j$, say $J_{ij}^{(j)}$.\n    Since the original Hamiltonian of the $XY$ model is Hermitian, we know that the real part of the couplings is symmetric while the imaginary part is skew-symmetric. \n   \n     The final estimate for $J_{ij}$ can then be obtained  averaging the two results:\n  \n  \n  \n   \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:symm}\n   J_{ij}^{\\rm inferred} = \\frac{J_{ij}^{(i)} + \\bar{J}_{ij}^{(j)}}{2} \n   \\end{equation}\n   where with $\\bar{J}$ we indicate the complex conjugate.\n   It is worth noting that the pseudolikelihood $L_i$, Eq. \\eqref{eq:L_i}, is characterized by the\n   following properties: (i) the normalization term of Eq.\\eqref{eq:marginal_xy} can be\n   computed analytically at odd with the {\\em full} likelihood case that\n   in general require a computational time which scales exponentially\n   with the size of the systems; (ii) the $\\ell_2$-regularized pseudolikelihood\n   defined in Eq.\\eqref{eq:plf_i} is strictly concave (i.e. it has a single\n   maximizer)\\cite{Ravikumar10}; (iii) it is consistent, i.e. if $M$ samples are\n   generated by a model $P(\\phi | J*)$ the maximizer tends to $J*$\n   for $M\\rightarrow\\infty$\\cite{besag1975}. Note also that (iii) guarantees that  \n   $|J^{(i)}_{ij}-J^{(j)}_{ij}| \\rightarrow 0$ for $M\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n   In Secs. \\ref{sec:res_reg}, \\ref{sec:res_dec} \n   we report the results obtained and we analyze the performances of the PLM having taken the configurations from Monte-Carlo simulations of models whose details are known.\n   \n\n   \n   \\subsection{PLM with decimation}\n   Even though the PLM with $l_2$-regularization allows to dwell the inference towards the low temperature region and in the low sampling case with better performances that mean-field methods, in some situations some couplings are overestimated and not at all symmetric. Moreover, in the technique there is the bias of the $l_2$ regularizer.\n   Trying to overcome these problems, Decelle and Ricci-Tersenghi introduced a new method \\cite{Decelle14}, known as PLM + decimation: the algorithm maximizes the sum of the $L_i$,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n    {\\cal L}\\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mbox{L}_i\n    \\end{eqnarray}  \n    and, then, it recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small. We expect that as long as we are setting to zero couplings that are unnecessary to fit the data, there should be not much changing on ${\\cal L}$. Keeping on with decimation, a point is reached where ${\\cal L}$ decreases abruptly indicating  that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place.\n   Let us define  by $x$  the fraction of non-decimated couplings. To have a quantitative measure for the halt criterion of the decimation process, a tilted ${\\cal L}$ is defined as,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{L}_t &\\equiv& \\mathcal{L}  - x \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{max}} - (1-x) \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}} \\label{$t$PLF} \n   \\end{eqnarray}\n   where \n   \\begin{itemize}\n   \\item $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood of a model with independent variables. In the XY case: $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}}=-\\ln{2 \\pi}$.\n   \\item\n   $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{max}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood in the fully-connected model and it is maximized over all the $N(N-1)\/2$ possible couplings. \n   \\end{itemize}\n   At the first step, when $x=1$, $\\mathcal{L}$ takes value $\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm max}$ and  $\\mathcal{L}_t=0$. On the last step, for an empty graph, i.e., $x=0$, $\\mathcal{L}$ takes the value $\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm min}$ and, hence, again $\\mathcal{L}_t =0$. \n   In the intermediate steps, during the decimation procedure, as $x$ is decreasing from $1$ to $0$, one observes firstly that $\\mathcal{L}_t$ increases linearly and, then, it displays an abrupt decrease indicating that from this point on relevant couplings are being decimated\\cite{Decelle14}. In Fig. \\ref{Jor1-$t$PLF} we give an instance of this behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered couplings. We notice that the maximum point of $\\mathcal{L}_t$ coincides with the minimum point of the reconstruction error, the latter defined as \n   \\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq:errj}\n   \\mbox{err}_J \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i<j} (J^{\\rm inferred}_{ij} -J^{\\rm true}_{ij})^2}{N(N-1)\/2}} \\label{err}\n   \\end{eqnarray}\n  We stress that the ${\\cal L}_t$ maximum is obtained ignoring the underlying graph, while the err$_J$ minimum can be evaluated once the true graph has been reconstructed. \n   \n     \\begin{figure}[t!]\n   \t\\centering\n   \t\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Jor1_dec_tPLF_new.eps}\n   \t\\caption{The tilted likelyhood ${\\cal L}_t$ curve and the reconstruction error vs the number of decimated couplings  for an ordered, real-valued J on 2D XY model with $N=64$ spins.

The process is repeated for all the couplings obtaining then a fully connected adjacency matrix. The results here presented are obtained with $\\lambda = 0.01$.\n   For the minimization we have used the MATLAB routine \\emph{minFunc\\_2012}\\cite{min_func}. \n      \n      \\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \t\\centering\n    \t\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_JR_soJR_TPJR}\n    \t\\caption{Top panels: instances of single site coupling reconstruction for the case of $N=64$ XY spins on a 2D lattice with ordered $J$ (left column) and bimodal distributed $J$ (right column). \n    \t\n    \tBottom panels: sorted couplings.}\n    \t\\label{PL-Jor1}\n    \\end{figure}\n\n   \nTo produce the data by means of numerical Monte Carlo simulations a system with $N=64$  spin variables  is considered on a deterministic 2D lattice with periodic boundary conditions. \nEach spin has then connectivity $4$, i.e., we expect to infer an adjacency matrix with $N c = 256$ couplings different from zero. \nThe dynamics of the simulated model is based on the Metropolis algorithm and parallel tempering\\cite{earl05} is used to speed up the thermalization of the system.\nThe thermalization is tested looking at the average energy over logarithmic time windows and\nthe acquisition of independent configurations\nstarts only after the system is well thermalized.\n\n   For the values of the couplings we considered two cases: an ordered case, indicated in the figure as  $J$ ordered (e.g., left column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1}) where the couplings can take values $J_{ij}=0,J$, with $J=1$, \n   and a quenched disordered case, indicated in the figures as  $J$ disordered (e.g., right column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1})\n   where the couplings can take also  negative values, i.e., \n    $J_{ij}=0,J,-J$, with a certain probability.  The results here presented were obtained with bimodal distributed $J$s: \n   \n    $P(J_{ij}=J)=P(J_{ij}=-J)=1\/2$.  The performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on $P(J)$. \n   \n    We recall that in Sec. \\ref{sec:plm} we used the temperature-rescaled notation, i.e., $J_{ij}$ stands for $J_{ij}\/T$. \n   \n    To analyze the performances of the PLM, in Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1} the inferred couplings, $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$, are shown on top of the original couplings,  $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm true}$.\n     The first figure (from top) in the left column shows  the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$ (black) and the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm tru}$ (green) for a given spin\n     at temperature $T\/J=0.7$ and number of samples  $M=1024$. PLM appears to reconstruct the correct couplings, though zero couplings are always given a small inferred non-zero value. \n     In the left column of Fig.  \\ref{PL-Jor1},  both the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm{inf}}$ and the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm{tru}}$ are sorted in decreasing order and plotted on top of each other. \n     We can clearly see that $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$ reproduces the expected step function. Even though the jump is smeared, the difference between inferred couplings corresponding to the set of non-zero couplings \n     and to the set of zero couplings can be clearly appreciated.\n     Similarly, the plots in the right column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1} show the results obtained for the case with  bimodal disordered couplings, for the same working temperature and number of samples. \n     In particular, note that the algorithm infers half positive and half negative couplings, as expected.\n     \n     \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_errJ_varT_varM}\n\\caption{Reconstruction error $\\mbox{err}_J$, cf.

(\\ref{err}), as a function of temperature for three different sample sizes $M=64,128$ and $512$. \nThe error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature, incidentally, in the ordered case, for  $T<T_c \\sim 0.893$, which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the 2XY model\\cite{Olsson92}. \n However, we can see that if only $M=64$ samples are considered, $\\mbox{err}_J$ remains high independently on the working temperature. \n In the right plot of Fig. \\ref{PL-err-Jor1},  $\\mbox{err}_J$ is plotted as a function of $M$ for three different working temperatures $T\/J=0.4,0.7$ and $1.3$. As we expect, \n $\\mbox{err}_J$  decreases as $M$ increases. This effect was observed also with mean-field inference techniques on the same model\\cite{Tyagi15}.\n\nTo better understand the performances of the algorithms, in Fig. \\ref{PL-varTP-Jor1} we show several True Positive (TP) curves obtained for various values of $M$ at three different temperatures $T$. As $M$ is large and\/or temperature is not too small,  we are able to reconstruct correctly all the couplings present in the system (see bottom plots).\nThe True Positive curve displays how many times the inference method finds a true link of the original network  as a function of the index of the vector of sorted absolute value of reconstructed couplings $J_{ij}^{\\rm inf}$. \nThe index $n_{(ij)}$ represents the related spin couples $(ij)$. The TP curve is obtained as follows: \nfirst  the values $|J^{\\rm inf}_{ij}|$ are sorted in descending order and  the spin pairs $(ij)$ are ordered according to the sorting position of $|J^{\\rm inf}_{ij}|$. Then,\n     \ta cycle over the ordered set of pairs $(ij)$, indexed by $n_{(ij)}$, is performed, comparing with the original network coupling $J^{\\rm true}_{ij}$ and verifying whether it is zero or not. The true positive curve is computed as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mbox{TP}[n_{(ij)}]= \\frac{\\mbox{TP}\\left[n_{(ij)}-1\\right] (n_{ij}-1)+ 1 -\\delta_{J^{\\rm true}_{ij},0}}{n_{(ij)}}\n\\end{equation}\nAs far as $J^{\\rm true}_{ij} \\neq 0$, TP$=1$. As soon as the true coupling of a given $(ij)$ couple in the sorted list is zero, the TP curve departs from one. \nIn our case, where the connectivity per spin of the original system is  $c=4$ and there are $N=64$ spins, we know that we will have  $256$ non-zero couplings.  \n     \tIf the inverse problem is successful, hence, we expect a steep decrease of the TP curve when  $n_{ij}=256$ is overcome.\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{PL-varTP-Jor1}\nit is  shown that,  almost independently of $T\/J$, the TP score improves as $M$ increases. Results are plotted for three different temperatures, $T=0.4,1$ and $2.2$, with increasing number of samples $M = 64, 128,512$ and $1024$ (clockwise). \nWe can clearly appreciate the improvement in temperature if the size of the data-set is not very large: for small $M$, $T=0.4$ performs better. \nWhen $M$ is high enough (e.g., $M=1024$), instead, the TP curves do not appear to be strongly influenced by the temperature.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_TPJR_varT_varM}\n\t\\caption{TP  curves  for 2D short-range ordered $XY$ model with $N=64$ spins at three different values of $T\/J$ with increasing - clockwise from top - $M$.}\n\t\\label{PL-varTP-Jor1} \n\\end{figure} \n\n\\subsection{$XY$ model with complex-valued couplings}\nFor the complex $XY$ we have to contemporary  infer $2$ apart coupling matrices,  $J^R_{i j}$ and $J^I_{i j}$.

In comparison to the results shown in Sec. \\ref{sec:res_reg},\n  the PLM with decimation leads to rather cleaner results. In Figs. \\ref{MF_PL_err} and \\ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the performances of the PLM with decimation in respect to ones of the PLM with $l_2$-regularization. These two techniques are also analysed in respect to a mean-field technique previously implemented on the same XY systems\\cite{Tyagi15}.\n  \n    For what concerns the network of connecting links, in Fig. \\ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the TP curves obtained with the three techniques. The results refer to the case of ordered and real valued couplings, but similar behaviours were obtained for the other cases analysed. \n  The four graphs are related to different sample sizes, with $M$ increasing clockwise. When $M$ is high enough, all techniques reproduce the true network. \n  However, for lower values of $M$ the performances of the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and with decimation drastically overcome those ones of the previous mean field technique. \n  In particular, for $M=256$ the PLM techniques still reproduce the original network while the mean-field method fails to find more than half of the couplings. \n  When $M=128$, the network is clearly reconstructed only through the PLM with decimation while the PLM with $l_2$ regularization underestimates the couplings. \n  Furthermore, we notice that the PLM method with decimation is able to clearly infer the network of interaction even when $M=N$ signalling that it could be considered also in the under-sampling regime $M<N$.  \n \n \nIn Fig. \\ref{MF_PL_err} we compare the temperature behaviour of the reconstruction error.\nIn can be observed that for all temperatures and for all sample sizes  the reconstruction error, ${\\rm err_J}$, (plotted here in log-scale) obtained with the PLM+decimation is always smaller than \nthat one obtained with the other techniques. The temperature behaviour of ${\\rm err_J}$ agrees with the one already observed for Ising spins in \\cite{Nguyen12b} and for XY spins  in \\cite{Tyagi15} with a mean-field approach:  ${\\rm err_J}$ displays a minimum around $T\\simeq 1$ and then it increases for very lower $T$; however,\n the error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller  than the error estimated by the other methods.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n     \n     \\section{Conclusions}\n     \\label{sec:conc}\n\n\nDifferent statistical inference methods have been applied to the inverse problem of the XY model.\nAfter a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances\nwith diluted, sparse, interactions.\n\nThe main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables.\nThe PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value.\n\nThe behavior of the inference quality in temperature and in the size of data samples is also investigated, basically confirming the low $T$ behavior hinted by Nguyen and Berg \\cite{Nguyen12b} for the Ising model. In temperature, in particular, the reconstruction error curve displays a minimum at a low temperature, close to the critical point in those cases in which a critical behavior occurs, and a sharp increase as temperature goes to zero. The decimation method, once again, appears to enhance this minimum of the reconstruction error of almost an order of magnitude with respect to other methods.\n \nThe techniques displayed and the results obtained in this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose theoretical representation is given by Eq. \\eqref{eq:HXY} or Eq. \\eqref{eq:h_im}, some of which are recalled in Sec. \\ref{sec:model}. In particular, a possible application can be the field of light waves propagation through random media and the corresponding problem of the  reconstruction of an object seen through an opaque medium or a disordered optical fiber \\cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b, Popoff10a,Akbulut11,Popoff11,Yilmaz13,Riboli14}.\n\n \t","label":"longbench","length":13292,"title":"\\section{Introduction}"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nManimaran\nManimaran is an Indian film director, working in the Tamil film industry.\n\nCareer\nHe made his directorial debut in Tamil, Udhayam NH4 (2013) featuring Siddharth and a newcomer Ashrita Shetty in lead roles. It was simultaneously dubbed and released in Telugu in the same year. Udhayam NH4 was produced by Meeka Entertainment and Grass Root Film Company for which director Vetrimaaran penned the story. Manimaran was born and brought up in a town Walajapet near Vellore. Manimaran was one of a former associate of director Vetrimaaran and had worked in Vetrimaaran's films Polladhavan and Aadukalam. He collaborated once again with director Vetrimaran and actor Dhanush as a second unit direct in the 2019 film, Asuran. In 2021, he directed Sangathalaivan. The Samuthirakani-starrer wears its Communist shirt proudly but fails to sell its politics convincingly. Manimaran is far too abrasive in that he projects his protagonist as simply no more than the average Tamil film hero.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 2:\nThe Godfather Part II (soundtrack)\nThe Godfather Part II is the Academy Award winning soundtrack from the movie of the same name, released in 1974 by ABC, and 1991 on compact disc by MCA. The original score was composed by Nino Rota and conducted by Carmine Coppola, who also provided source music for the film. Rota expands upon two of the three main themes from the first film: \"The Godfather Waltz\" and \"Michael's Theme\", while \"The Love Theme\" from the first film makes a brief appearance during a flashback sequence (\"Remember Vito Andolini\"). There are several new themes, including one for Kay (Diane Keaton), and two for young Vito (Robert De Niro): \"The Immigrant Theme\" and \"The Tarantella\", introduced in \"A New Carpet\".\n\nTrack listing\nAwards and nominations\nAlbum chart\n1975: The Godfather Part II: Pop albums: #184\n\nCredits\nSource:\n\nRelease history\nPassage 3:\nTrue Grit: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\nTrue Grit may refer to:\n\nFiction\nTrue Grit (novel), a 1968 novel by Charles Portis\nTrue Grit (1969 film), a film adaptation by Henry Hathaway, starring John Wayne\nTrue Grit (2010 film), a film adaptation by the Coen Brothers, starring Jeff Bridges\n\nMusic\nTrue Grit (1969 soundtrack), by Glen Campbell and Elmer Bernstein\n\"True Grit\" (song), the album's title track\nTrue Grit (2010 soundtrack), by Carter Burwell\nTrue Grit (Bret Michaels album), 2015\n\"True Grit\", a song by the Crystal Method from Legion of Boom, 2004\n\nOther uses\nTrue Grit (mascot), at University of Maryland, Baltimore County, US\n\nSee also\nTrue Grit: A Further Adventure, a 1978 made-for-TV sequel\nGrit (disambiguation)\nPassage 4:\nAshrita Shetty\nAshrita Shetty (born 16 July 1993) is an Indian actress who predominantly works in Tamil language films.\n\nEarly life\nShetty was born on 16 July 1993 in a South Indian family from Karnataka. She hails from Mumbai and has studied finance.\n\nCareer\nIn 2010, Shetty participated in a beauty contest organised by The Times of India, Clean & Clear Fresh Face. Competing in Mumbai, she won the event there and then went on to win it again at the national level, eventually becoming the face of the brand for a year. She made her film debut in 2012, with a Tulu film, Telikeda Bolli. During the time, she appeared in various other television commercials. This was when film directors Vetrimaaran and Manimaran approached her to play the lead role in their venture, Udhayam NH4. The film saw her play a Bangalore-based Tamil-speaking college girl, who elopes with the character played by Siddharth. She gained mixed reviews for her portrayal in the film, with a reviewer noting she could be a promising actress in the making. Sangeeta Devi from The Hindu said \"Newcomer Ashrita Shetty shows promise and her capability of bringing to the screen the vulnerability and innocence of a 17\/18-year-old makes her endearing. This girl has huge potential.\" She then signed the lead in the action adventure film Indrajith opposite Gautham Karthik.\n\nPersonal life\nShetty married Indian cricketer Manish Pandey on 2 December 2019.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 5:\nGrass Root Film Company\nGrass Root Film Company is an Indian film production and distribution company.

It stars Sharwanand and Nithya Menen while Prakash Raj and Santhanam play supporting roles. The film featured songs by G. V. Prakash Kumar and film scored by Siddharth Vipin. After failing to have a theatrical release in late 2013, the Tamil version of the film had a direct-to-video release in March 2015, becoming the first venture in a new initiative launched by Cheran known as Cinema2Home (C2H). The Telugu version of the film had been indefinitely placed on hold, but was later released theatrically in June 2016, with the makers trying to profit from Sharwanand's popularity.\n\nPlot\nJayakumar (Sharwanand), commonly known as JK, is a mid-20s man who does not care about family. Instead, he is obsessed with chatting on Facebook, partying, and passing time with friends. At work, he has a group of friends with similar interests. They all plan on going for a New Year Party.\nTwo years later, JK is shown to be a changed person \u2013 very invested in developing, earning money and taking care of his family. He is shown to make business models with an aim of earning a lot of money in a short period of time. He has goals such as getting his two sisters married and ensuring that his brother gets good education. In attempts to start business, he goes to meet a bank manager at his home. As they had to wait for the bank manager to come, JK and his friend notice that the house is not well-maintained and take on the job to organise it. Upon returning, bank manager appreciates their work and tells JK and his friend that it would be very helpful if they could help clean homes regularly. He also suggests that about 150 other flats in his apartment complex would also appreciate this service. This becomes JK's first business venture. For this, he also ropes in help from his school friend Nithya (Nithya Menen). Together, JK, Nithya, and their friends go on to become very successful with multiple projects.\nLater, the reason for change in JK's behaviour is explained. When JK and friends were planning to go for the New Year Party, Ravi also wants to go with them and becomes a good friend of JK. Ravi comes from a very poor background, and his family is dependent on him. After the party, the gang meets with an accident, resulting in Ravi's death and a serious head injury for JK. JK has only a couple of years left in his life. This makes him realise the importance of life, and he decides to make his family happy and make sure that they have enough money before he dies. However, JK does not tell this to anyone but Nithya. In the end, JK leaves the responsibilities of business and his family to Nithya and goes off to the USA (where he would likely die because of his illness). Nithya is shown to be running the business and living with memories of time spent with her best friend JK.\n\nCast\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack features five songs composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, with lyrics by Na. Muthukumar, Yugabharathi, Madhan Karky, Cheran. The album was released by Cheran's music company Dream Sounds Digital Solution on 15 September 2013. The film's score was composed by Siddharth Vipin who also composed three additional songs for the film. Milliblog wrote: \"Cheran's last film as director \u2013 Pokkisham \u2013 had fantastic music from Sabesh Murali; the move to GV Prakash Kumar produces underwhelming results\". Indiaglitz wrote: \"Funky, rocking and melodious, the album has everything that the youth these days want to listen to. Predominantly duets and only one solo to speak of, the album will certainly be a popular favourite among all\". Behindwoods wrote:\"There are moments of classic GVP, but could have done with few more\".\nTamil\nTelugu\n\nMarketing\nSharwanand had dubbed for his character in Tamil. As part of the promotion Cheran initiated a project named JK Fest 2013, in which college students from Tamil Nadu could participate. Students were asked to visualise and use their creativity to enact the songs of JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai without knowing the film's story. Cheran revealed that the film would be released on Internet, DVD and satellite, on the same day of its theatrical release. Cheran added that by releasing the film across all media on the same day, piracy could be curbed. However, the theatrical release did not happen; the film was instead released as a direct-to-video film on 6 March 2015, via Cheran's C2H (Cinema2Home) initiative. The Telugu version, initially titled Yemito Ee Maya, was later retitled as Rajadhi Raja and released theatrically on 24 June 2016, with the makers attempting to profit from Sharwanand's resurgence at the Telugu box office. However, this version failed commercially.\n\nReception\nBaradwaj Rangan wrote for The Hindu, \"JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai feels like Cheran's attempt to show that he isn't, anymore, the sentimental, melodramatic filmmaker whose good intentions haven't always resulted in good movies (or good box-office collections). He's trying to show us that he can be young, hip. [...] JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai may have worked if Cheran had stuck to his style\". Regarding the Telugu version, a critic from The Hans India wrote that \"Rajadhi Raja is a breezy feel good film with colourful visuals, enchanting score and well sketched characters.\nPassage 8:\nUdhayam NH4\nUdhayam NH4 is a 2013 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film directed by debutant Manimaran, a former associate of Vetrimaaran. The film stars Siddharth and newcomer Ashrita Shetty. Vetrimaaran wrote the script, did the screenplay, and penned the dialogues for this film. The story takes place in Bangalore, Karnataka. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar. The film released along with a dubbed Telugu version titled NH4 on 19 April 2013.\n\nPlot\nPrabhu falls in love with Rithika, his classmate, who reciprocates his feelings, but are separated after Rithika's father disapproves of their relationship. Prabhu, lovelorn, discusses the route from Bangalore to Chennai with his friends and plan to kidnap Rithika to elope. Meanwhile, Rithika's father, Avinash Gowda, appoints encounter specialist ACP Manoj Menon IPS, who questions Rithika's male friend Deepak about Prabhu. Deepak claims that Prabhu is a drug addict and was always trying to woo Rithika, who started to avoid him because of Prabhu. After that, the plot continues when Manoj tries to track Prabhu and his friends. In the attempt, they track down a message from another friend named Umesh, asking Prabhu and friends to come to Bangarpet bus stand, only to find Manoj and his team arresting the guy for more information. Manoj goes to a railway station where the train in which Prabhu and Rithika are travelling to Chennai via Kuppam, Andhra Pradesh. He finds Rithika and forcefully drags her into his jeep. \nAs the flashback winds again (this time by Rithika), she fell for Prabhu after seeing him on many instances showing his presence of mind. As the flashback ends, Manoj finds Prabhu on the highway, where he does not stop until he runs over pieces of glass put down by Prabhu. They get into a brawl where Prabhu loses, and Manoj continues in the highway but has to stop in a railway signal at Andhra Pradesh-Karnataka border. Prabhu takes his chance and threatens Manoj, keeping his throat under a blade and taking Rithika with him. After a cat and mouse chase, Manoj calls Prabhu, saying that his friend needs immediate treatment after an accident. He goes in search of Manoj and involves in a fight with him again. Now, after the stroke of midnight, Rithika turns 18, giving her the right for choosing her partner. After that, Manoj leaves the highway, as he could not do anymore, according to the law.\n\nCast\nProduction\nWhile working with Balu Mahendra for Adhu Oru Kana Kaalam (2005), producer Vetrimaaran prepared a script for Dhanush, who was the lead hero of the film he worked on, and Dhanush immediately accepted the offer after hearing the story. The film titled was Desiya Nedunchalai 47 was initially launched with Yuvan Shankar Raja as the music director and Ekambaram as the cinematographer. However, he found trouble finding producers with A. M. Rathnam and Salem Chandrasekhar leaving the project after initial interest, Dhanush's sister Dr. Vimala Geetha agreed to produce the film, but she also dropped the film. Dhanush's father Kasthuri Raja finally agreed to produce the film, and Kirat Bhattal was signed as heroine, while Harris Jayaraj was selected as music director. However, after two days of shoot, the film was shelved, and Dhanush opted to pursue other films after the surprise success of his Thiruvilayadal Arambam (2006). The film's collapse saw Vetrimaaran approach producer Kadiresan and narrated to him the stories he had prepared, but the producer did not like Desiya Nedunchaalai 47, but later agreed to work on another project titled Polladhavan.\nVetrimaaran restarted the film as a creative producer with Dayanidhi Azhagiri, and chose to give the script to debutant director Manimaaran, who was initially nervous to take over a script by a National film winner. The team tried to re-take the title Desiya Nedunchalai, but this name was already registered by Dr. Srinivasan, which hence led to the renaming of the title to Udhayam NH4. Cloud Nine Movies approached Siddharth for the lead role, who immediately accepted it. Kishore, who was initially approached for a role in 2006, was re-approached but was unable to commit dates for the film. Subsequently Kay Kay Menon, who Vetrimaaran had been discussing a role in his next film Vada Chennai with, was signed on to play a pivotal role in the film. Debut actress Ashrita Shetty was selected to play the lead female role. Ramya was signed to appear in a cameo appearance in the film but eventually did not feature. Newbies Ajai, Kalai and Karthi play Siddharth's friends. Velraj is the cinematographer, music by G. V. Prakash Kumar editing will be by Kishore Te. The film will be produced jointly by Dayanidhi Azhagiri and Vetrimaaran as a tie-up between their companies Meeka Entertainment and Grass Root Film Company. The filming took place only on real locations, where crowds delayed shootings up to four days, making hidden cameras mandatory.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack album was composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar. The music rights were acquired by Sony Music India. On Valentine's day, the track \"Yaaro Ivan\" was unveiled at Suryan FM. Actor Siddharth sang the Telugu version of this song.\n\nRelease\nThe satellite rights for the film were secured by Sun TV. The film was given a \"U\/A\" certificate by the Indian Censor Board. On 14 February 2013, the first film trailer was released at Sun Music.Udhayam NH4 released in around 250 theatres across Tamil Nadu along with Gouravam (2013).\n\nReception\nUpon release, Udhayam NH4 generally received favourable reviews. Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu thanked the film crew for a well treated, but slight story, \"[...] the constant infusion of colour keeps us hooked. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve laughed so much at a cop telling his nagging wife he loves her.\" Behindwoods gave 3 of 5 stars and concluded, \"To sum it all, Udhayam NH 4 comes across as a well packaged product that has many things going in its favor and is sure to have patrons from the youth along with other sections of the audience too.\" Sify recommended the film, \"The presentation is unique as it doesn\u2019t have the trappings of usual masala potboilers.\" in.com rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated that the story is simple but the taut screenplay with unexpected twists and turns at the right time makes Udhayam a good watch. Mahalakshmi Prabhakaran of Daily News and Analysis criticized the performance of Ashrita Shetty heavily, \"As the character who\u2019s the prize catch for both the cop and the boyfriend, the role\u2019s every debutante actress' dream. But Hrishita just doesn\u2019t match up. We are not even going to comment on her poor delivery of Tamil. Yes, she might be a Kannadiga in the movie, but that\u2019s no excuse!\", giving the film an average rating of 3. S. Saarawathi of Rediff wrote, \"Udhayam NH4 is a racy entertainer that keeps you glued to the screen.\" Sidharth Varma of The Times of India rated it 3.5 out of 5 stars and said, \"The movie brings in a whiff of fresh air in the dialogue department. The characters switch between the four south Indian languages and English depending on the place where the scene is set and the situation, which adds to the authenticity of the movie. The drama is injected in the right doses through the incidents on the highway, and flashbacks tell us more about each character.\" Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu recommended the film, \"Take a ride down this highway just to see how a talented director can make a simple story engaging.\" Review Raja found the film to be \"just an alright movie\", and thought, that Ashrita Shetty wasn't capable enough to play the female lead role. Bangalore Mirror gave the film 3.5 out of 5 saying that the film is well crafted.\nPassage 9:\nInterstellar (soundtrack)\nInterstellar: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album composed by Hans Zimmer for the 2014 film Interstellar by Christopher Nolan. The soundtrack garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\nBackground and production\nHans Zimmer had previously worked with director Christopher Nolan, scoring Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight film trilogy and Inception. Without revealing the plot of Interstellar, Nolan wrote a short story for Zimmer about a father leaving a child to complete an important job. The story contained two sentences of dialogue: \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and \u201cWhen?\u201d. Nolan then asked Zimmer to spend one day composing some musical interpretations of the story.\nI am going to give you an envelope with a letter in it. One page. It's going to tell you the fable at the center of the story. You work for one day, then play me what you have written.\nIn one night, Zimmer wrote a four-minute piano and organ piece that represented his idea of fatherhood. When he played it for Nolan, Nolan was pleased and explained the full plot and concept of the film, though it had not yet been written. Zimmer was originally skeptical, noting that he had written a \"tiny, tiny little fragile\" piece while Nolan had described an intense, epic space film. However, Nolan reassured Zimmer that the piano piece provided \"the heart\" of the film. The piece can be heard at the conclusion of the film.For the film's signature organ, Zimmer specifically requested that organist Roger Sayer, the music director of Temple Church in London, play the church's 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ. The physical appearance of organ reminded Zimmer of spaceship afterburners, while the airiness of its sound evoked the reminder that every breath is precious for an astronaut. The rest of the ensemble consisted of 34 strings, 24 woodwinds, four pianos, and a mixed choir of 60 voices. The soundtrack was recorded at both Temple Church and AIR Lyndhurst Hall in late spring 2014.In 2022, Zimmer cited the Interstellar soundtrack as the best work of his career.\n\nRelease\nZimmer himself delayed the soundtrack album's release until two weeks after the film premiere because he wanted audiences to hear the score in theaters first.\nWe wanted people to really hear it for the first time with the movie on really big speakers in a theater... I just didn't want people to go and hear everything on tiny little speakers on their Mac or something like this. I wanted them to go and have the visceral experience of being pinned in their seats.\nThe soundtrack was released on November 17, 2014 via the WaterTower label. On November 13, 2020, WaterTower released an expanded edition of the soundtrack.\n\nCritical reception\nThe score received critical acclaim. Reviewing for BBC News, Nicholas Barber felt, \"Hans Zimmer's music makes the film seem even more colossal than it would otherwise: Zimmer invokes the original meaning of 'pulls out all the stops', rattling our teeth with reverberating pipe-organ chords.\" Scott Foundas, a chief film critic at Variety, stated, \"Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Strauss-ian crescendos.Many critics have noted distinct similarities between the score and the work of Philip Glass, especially Koyaanisqatsi (1982). However, despite Interstellar's near-identical central melody and instrumentation, few have criticized Zimmer when drawing the comparison. Time Out London's Dave Calhoun exclaimed, \"Listen to unnerving silence as well as Hans Zimmer's organ-heavy score!\" Tim Robey of The Telegraph felt \"With the vast sounds of a composer set loose on his grandest ever assignment. But it relies less on Straussian majesty \u00e0 la 2001 than something rather more pointed: the hypnotic, metronomically surging, and oddly sacred homage Zimmer gives us to Koyaanisqatsi by Philip Glass.\" Todd McCarthy, reviewing for The Hollywood Reporter, praised it as, \"soaring, sometimes domineering and unconventionally orchestrated wall-of-sound score\" Richard Corliss of Time called it \"pounding organ score\". Jeremy Aspinall of Radio Times called the score subtle but evocative. Critic Jeffrey M. Anderson for The San Francisco Examiner writes, \"rumbling and thundering sound effects and music\". At The Irish Times, Donald Clarke wrote that \"Hans Zimmer slumps on the biggest pipe organ in town\". For NPR, Chris Klimek stated that Zimmer's gives a church-organ score. Joe Morgenstern for Wall Street Journal felt that \"At one point the orchestral churnings of Hans Zimmer's score suggest something epic under way\". American film critic Peter Travers at Rolling Stone noted, \"thrilling images oomphed by Hans Zimmer's score, and you'll get the meaning of \"\u2018rock the house.\u2018\"  For The Globe and Mail, Liam Lacey stated, \"Throughout, Hans Zimmer's music throbs obtrusively, occasionally fighting with the dialogue for our attention.\" \"As usual, Nolan's frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer has come up with a score that fits the impossible dimensions of the film, and the music adds tremendously to the excitement\", said critic Rene Rodriguez, writing for The Miami Herald. Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post commented, \"Hans Zimmer's basso profundo organ-music score and pummeling sound effects.\" Steven Biscotti of Soundtrack.net too praised the soundtrack stating, \"Hans Zimmer has created a close to perfect musical canvas for those extremely dedicated to the audio experience. The compositional technique on the album may turn off a few, as it is different than Zimmer's recent offerings. However, for those that stick with the album, they will see it 'not go gentle into that good night.' Zimmer's Interstellar rages!\" and awarded a perfect five out of five stars.In response to criticisms about the music being too overpowering and at times drowning out the dialogue, Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter: \"Many of the filmmakers I\u2019ve admired over the years have used sound in bold and adventurous ways. I don\u2019t agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions\u2014I  try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal\u2014picture and sound.\"Jonathan Broxton of Movie Music UK acclaimed the album, stating, \"The orchestration choices, especially the stripped down ensemble and the use of the pipe organ, shows a composer not afraid to think outside the box, and find unique solutions to the musical problems his film presents, and the emotional content of the score is high, but not overwhelming\", and summarised with, \"It's an absolute lock for an Oscar nomination, and is one of the best scores of 2014.\" Tangerine Circus's guitarist Francesc Messeguer cited the score and the film as one of his top five favorite albums and films, respectively.In his in-depth musical analysis, Mark Richards of Film Music Notes concludes: \"Rather than simply being associated with a certain character or group of characters, Zimmer\u2019s themes tend to emphasize the emotions a particular character or group is feeling at various points in the film. [...] Interstellar has at its core an emotional story of love between a father and his daughter. Appropriately, Hans Zimmer places the Murph and Cooper theme front and center in the score [...]. Of course, since the film also includes some riveting action sequences, the score does make use of an action theme, but in typical Zimmer style, this theme serves two different functions as it is also the familial love theme. [...] And Zimmer also captures Interstellar\u2019s focus on the wonder of the natural world in a separate theme. Thus, the score provides an effective glue for the film by drawing emotional links between various events, character motivations, and visual spectacles that might otherwise seem rather disconnected.\"\n\nTrack listing\nStandard edition\nDeluxe edition bonus tracks\nIlluminated Star Projection edition\nVinyl Edition (Standard)\nMovieTickets.com bonus track\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from CD liner notes.\nAll music composed by Hans Zimmer\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nPassage 10:\nG. V. Prakash Kumar\nG. V. Prakash Kumar is an Indian music composer, playback singer, actor and producer known for his work in Tamil films and a few Telugu films as well. His first film was S Pictures' Veyil (2006) and he gained fame in Tamil films by the early 2010s. He made his debut in acting on 2015 through Darling. He has won one National Award and three Filmfare Awards in his film career.\n\nEarly life\nPrakash Kumar is the only son of G. Venkatesh and playback singer A. R. Reihana, who is the elder sister of music director A. R. Rahman. He also has a younger sister named Bhavani Sre, who is an actress and appeared in films such as \"Vidudhalai\"Ka Pae Ranasingam and Paava Kadhaigal.\n\nPersonal life\nPrakash married his schoolmate, singer Saindhavi, in 2013. The couple became parents to a daughter named Anvi in 2020.\n\nCareer\nMusic direction\nHe first appeared as a vocalist on the soundtrack of director S. Shankar's Tamil film Gentleman (1993), composed by his maternal uncle, A. R. Rahman. He has also contributed to some of Rahman's other projects. He had also worked with Harris Jayaraj and sang two songs in Anniyan (2005) and Unnale Unnale (2007).\nG.V. Prakash's introduction as a film composer was in the critically acclaimed Tamil film Veyil (2006) directed by Vasanthabalan and produced by director S. Shankar. His music in the film Madrasapattinam (2010), directed by A. L. Vijay was appreciated, especially his song \"Pookal Pookum Tharunam\".\nHe went on to win critical acclaim for his music in Selvaraghavan's fantasy action adventure film Aayirathil Oruvan (2009), National award winning Aadukalam (2010) and drama film Mayakkam Enna (2011), which became his third collaboration that featured Dhanush in the lead role. The album's five songs were written by Selvaraghavan and Dhanush, with the pair also coming together to sing the song \"Kadhal En Kadhal\". The album also included the song \"Pirai Thedum\", which Prakash sang himself along with his fianc\u00e9e, Saindhavi whilst another song \"Voda Voda Voda\", written and sung by Dhanush, was composed in just 5 minutes and recorded within an hour. Rediff.com reviewed the soundtrack claiming that Prakash had \"tried very hard to walk away from his comfort zone and provide the kind of edgy numbers Selvaraghavan demands, and has risen to the challenge\". Critics from entertainment portal Behindwoods.com cited that Prakash \"reiterates his talent once again\" and gave a verdict that the album is \"intoxicating enough\". In late September 2011, a single track \"Oru Murai\", written by Thamarai and composed and sung by Prakash in R. S. Infotainment's Muppozhudhum Un Karpanaigal (2012) was released. His subsequent releases include the political satire Saguni (2012) and the background score of the Hindi crime film Gangs of Wasseypur and also composed Sunrisers Hyderabad's first anthem. Songs of the movie Darling (2015) were hits. Especially \"Vandha Mala\", \"Anbe Anbe\" and \"Sattunu Idi Mazhai\".This is also the debut film for Prakash as an actor. Prakash's songs in Kaaka Muttai (2015) were massive hits. \"Karuppu Karuppu\" song was on charts for a few months. \"Karuppu Nerathazhagi\" was a huge hit from Komban (2015). G.V. Prakash signed his 50th film with director Atlee that is Vijay's 59th, which is named Theri (2016).GV Prakash's Last two releases as a composer and not his film as an actor are Vetrimaaran-Dhanush's Asuran (2019) and Sudha Kongara-Suriya's Soorarai Pottru (2020).\n\nFilm production\nIn 2013, Prakash Kumar launched his own production house under the name \"GV Prakash Kumar Productions\". His first film Madha Yaanai Koottam, was directed by Vikram Sugumaran, a former assistant of Balu Mahendra.\n\nActing\nIn 2012, director A.R. Murugadoss approached Kumar regarding a potential acting venture. Prakash agreed to star in the project, however, the film later failed to take off. He subsequently signed on to appear in three films in quick succession, with the three entering production simultaneously. In order to further his acting ability, he took lessons from actor Aadukalam Naren and has noted that his stage performances as a singer were also helpful in demonstrating his potential as an actor.Prakash was going to make his acting debut in a film titled Pencil, opposite Sri Divya, where he will be playing a school student. However, as Pencil's release was delayed, his first release became the horror film Darling. A remake of the 2013 Telugu film Prema Katha Chitram. Thereafter, Trisha Illana Nayanthara (2015). The film deals with the present day definition of love and the perspective of today's youngsters of both genders about love, relationship, virginity etc. In 2016, he appeared in Pencil and two comedies films Enakku Innoru Per Irukku and Kadavul Irukaan Kumaru. The next is Bruce Lee  (2017). He acted in the climax sequence as cameo appearance with Silambarasan's Anbanavan Asaradhavan Adangadhavan (2017). In 2018, he starred in Bala's action crime Naachiyaar. He acted in second role next to Jyothika. Then the comedy-drama, Semma released on May. In 2019, he had five releases this year with Sarvam Thaala Mayam, Kuppathu Raja, Watchman, Sivappu Manjal Pachai and 100% Kadhal.\nIn 2021, his film Vanakkam Da Mappilei was a direct to OTT release. It was marks the second collaboration of G. V. Prakash and Rajesh after 2016's Kadavul Irukaan Kumaru.

We hypothesize that the emergence and exact form of learning behaviors is naturally connected with the statistics of environmental fluctuations and tasks an organism needs to solve.\nHere, we study how different aspects of simulated environments shape an evolved synaptic plasticity rule in static and moving artificial agents. We demonstrate that environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity. Interestingly, the form of the emerging plasticity rule is additionally determined by the details of the task the artificial organisms are aiming to solve.\nMoreover, we show that coevolution between static connectivity and interacting plasticity mechanisms in distinct sub-networks changes the function and form of the emerging plasticity rules in embodied agents performing a foraging task. One of the defining features of living organisms is their ability to adapt to their environment and incorporate new information to modify their behavior.\nIt is unclear how the ability to learn first evolved , but its utility appears evident. Natural environments are too complex for all the necessary information to be hardcoded genetically and more importantly, they keep changing during an organism's lifetime in ways that cannot be anticipated ; . The link between learning and environmental uncertainty and fluctuation has been extensively demonstrated in both natural ; , and artificial environments .\nNevertheless, the ability to learn does not come without costs. For the capacity to learn to be beneficial in evolutionary terms, a costly nurturing period is often required, a phenomenon observed in both biological , and artificial organisms . Additionally, it has been shown that in some complex environments, hardcoded behaviors may be superior to learned ones given limits in the agent's lifetime and envi-ronmental uncertainty ; ; .\nThe theoretical investigation of the optimal balance between learned and innate behaviors in natural and artificial systems goes back several decades. However, it has recently found also a wide range of applications in applied AI systems ; . Most AI systems are trained for specific tasks, and have no need for modification after their training has been completed.\nStill, technological advances and the necessity to solve broad families of tasks make discussions about life-like AI systems relevant to a wide range of potential application areas. Thus the idea of open-ended AI agents that can continually interact with and adapt to changing environments has become particularly appealing.\nMany different approaches for introducing lifelong learning in artificial agents have been proposed. Some of them draw direct inspiration from actual biological systems ; . Among them, the most biologically plausible solution is to equip artificial neural networks with some local neural plasticity , similar to the large variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms ; ; that performs the bulk of the learning in the brains of living organisms .\nThe artificial plasticity mechanisms can be optimized to modify the connectivity of the artificial neural networks toward solving a particular task. The optimization can use a variety of approaches, most commonly evolutionary computation. The idea of meta-learning or optimizing synaptic plasticity rules to perform specific functions has been recently established as an engineering tool that can compete with stateof-the-art machine learning algorithms on various complex tasks ; ; Pedersen and Risi (2021); .\nAdditionally, it can be used to reverse engineer actual plasticity mechanisms found in biological neural networks and uncover their functions ; . Here, we study the effect that different factors (environ-arXiv:2303.06734v1 [q-bio.NC] 12 Mar 2023 mental fluctuation and reliability, task complexity) have on the form of evolved functional reward-modulated plasticity rules.\nWe investigate the evolution of plasticity rules in static, single-layer simple networks. Then we increase the complexity by switching to moving agents performing a complex foraging task. In both cases, we study the impact of different environmental parameters on the form of the evolved plasticity mechanisms and the interaction of learned and static network connectivity.\nInterestingly, we find that different environmental conditions and different combinations of static and plastic connectivity have a very large impact on the resulting plasticity rules. We imagine an agent who must forage to survive in an environment presenting various types of complex food particles. Each food particle is composed of various amounts and combinations of N ingredients that can have positive (food) or negative (poison) values.\nThe value of a food particle is a weighted sum of its ingredients. To predict the reward value of a given resource, the agent must learn the values of these ingredients by interacting with the environment. The priors could be generated by genetic memory, but the exact values are subject to change. To introduce environmental variability, we stochastically change the values of the ingredients.\nMore precisely, we define two ingredient-value distributions E 1 and E 2 and switch between them, with probability p tr for every time step. We control how (dis)similar the environments are by parametrically setting E 2 = (1 \u2212 2d e )E 1 , with d e \u2208 [0, 1] serving as a distance proxy for the environments; when d e = 0, the environment remains unchanged, and when d e = 1 the value of each ingredient fully reverses when the environmental transition happens.\nFor simplicity, we take values of the ingredients in E 1 equally spaced between -1 and 1 (for the visualization, see Fig. ). The static agent receives passively presented food as a vector of ingredients and can assess its compound value using the linear summation of its sensors with the (learned or evolved) weights, see Fig. .\nThe network consists of N sensory neurons that are projecting to a single post-synaptic neuron. At each time step, an input X t = (x 1 , . . . , x N ) is presented, were the value x i , i \u2208 {1, . . . , N } represents the quantity of the ingredient i. We draw x i independently form a uniform distribution on the [0, 1] interval (x i \u223c U (0, 1)).\nThe value of each ingredient w c i is determined by the environment (E 1 or E 2 ). The postsynaptic neuron outputs a prediction of the food X t value as y t = g(W X T t ). Throughout the paper, g will be either the identity function, in which case the prediction neuron is linear, or a step-function; however, it could be any other nonlinearity, such as a sigmoid or ReLU.\nAfter outputting the prediction, the neuron receives feedback in the form of the real value of the input R t . The real value is computed as R t = W c X T t + \u03be, where W c = (w c 1 , . . . , w c N ) is the actual value of the ingredients, and \u03be is a term summarizing the noise of reward and sensing system \u03be \u223c N (0, \u03c3).\nFigure : An outline of the static agent's network. The sensor layer receives inputs representing the quantity of each ingredient of a given food at each time step. The agent computes the prediction of the food's value y t and is then given the true value R t ; it finally uses this information in the plasticity rule to update the weight matrix.\nFor the evolutionary adjustment of the agent's parameters, the loss of the static agent is the sum of the mean squared errors (MSE) between its prediction y t and the reward R t over the lifetime of the agent. The agent's initial weights are set to the average of the two ingredient value distributions, which is the optimal initial value for the case of symmetric switching of environments that we consider here.\nAs a next step, we incorporate the sensory network of static agents into embodied agents that can move around in an environment scattered with food. To this end, we merge the static agent's network with a second, non-plastic motor network that is responsible for controlling the motion of the agent in the environment.\nSpecifically, the original plastic network now provides the agent with information about the value of the nearest food. The embodied agent has additional sensors for the distance from the nearest food, the angle between the current velocity and the nearest food direction, its own velocity, and its own energy level (sum of consumed food values).\nThese inputs are processed by two hidden layers (of 30 and 15 neurons) with tanh activation. The network's outputs are angular and linear acceleration, Fig. . The embodied agents spawn in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions along with a number of food particles that are selected such that the mean of the food value distribution is \u223c 0. An agent can eat food by approaching it sufficiently closely, and each time a food particle is eaten, it is The sensor layer receives inputs at each time step (the ingredients of the nearest food), which are processed by the plastic layer in the same way as the static sensory network, Fig. .\nThe output of that network is given as input to the motor network, along with the distance d and angle \u03b1 to the nearest food, the current velocity v, and energy E of the agent. These signals are processed through two hidden layers to the final output of motor commands as the linear and angular acceleration of the agent re-spawned with the same value somewhere randomly on the grid (following the setup of ).\nAfter 5000 time steps, the cumulative reward of the agent (the sum of the values of all the food it consumed) is taken as its fitness. During the evolutionary optimization, the parameters for both the motor network (connections) and plastic network (learning rule parameters) are co-evolved, and so agents must simultaneously learn to move and discriminate good\/bad food.\nReward-modulated plasticity is one of the most promising explanations for biological credit assignment . In our network, the plasticity rule that updates the weights of the linear sensor network is a rewardmodulated rule which is parameterized as a linear combination of the input, the output, and the reward at each time step:\nAdditionally, after each plasticity step, the weights are normalized by mean subtraction, an important step for the stabilization of Hebbian-like plasticity rules . We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the learning rate \u03b7 p and amplitudes of different terms \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ). The successful plasticity rule after many food presentations must converge to a weight vector that predicts the correct food values (or allows the agent to correctly decide whether to eat a food or avoid it).\nTo have comparable results, we divide \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ) by We then multiply the learning rate \u03b7 p with \u03b8 max to maintain the rule's evolved form unchanged, \u03b7 norm p = \u03b7 p \u2022 \u03b8 max . In the following, we always use normalized \u03b7 p and \u03b8, omitting norm . To evolve the plasticity rule and the moving agents' motor networks, we use a simple genetic algorithm with elitism .\nThe agents' parameters are initialized at random (drawn from a Gaussian distribution), then the sensory network is trained by the plasticity rule and finally, the agents are evaluated. After each generation, the bestperforming agents (top 10 % of the population size) are selected and copied into the next generation.\nThe remaining 90 % of the generation is repopulated with mutated copies of the best-performing agents. We mutate agents by adding independent Gaussian noise (\u03c3 = 0.1) to its parameters. To start with, we consider a static agent whose goal is to identify the value of presented food correctly. The static reward-prediction network quickly evolves the parameters of the learning rule, successfully solving the prediction task.\nWe first look at the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p , which determines how fast (if at all) the network's weight vector is updated during the lifetime of the agents. We identify three factors that control the learning rate parameter the EA converges to: the distance between the environments, the noisiness of the reward, and the rate of environmental transition.\nThe first natural factor is the distance d e between the two environments, with a larger distance requiring a higher learning rate, Fig. . This is an expected result since the convergence time to the \"correct\" weights is highly dependent on the initial conditions. If an agent is born at a point very close to optimality, which naturally happens if the environments are similar, the distance it needs to traverse on the fitness landscape is small.\nTherefore it can afford to have a small learning rate, which leads to a more stable convergence and is not affected by noise. A second parameter that impacts the learning rate is the variance of the rewards. The reward an agent receives for the plasticity step contains a noise term \u03be that is drawn from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation \u03c3.\nThis parameter controls the unreliability of the agent's sensory system, i.e., higher \u03c3 means that the information the agent gets about the value of the foods it consumes cannot be fully trusted to reflect the actual value of the foods. As \u03c3 increases, the learning rate \u03b7 p decreases, which means that the more unreliable an environment becomes, the less an agent relies on plasticity to update its weights, Fig. .\nIndeed for some combinations of relatively small distance d e and high reward variance \u03c3, the EA converges to a learning rate of \u03b7 p \u2248 0. This means that the agent opts to have no adaptation during its lifetime and remain at the mean of the two environments. It is an optimal solution when the expected loss due to ignoring the environmental transitions is, on average, lower than the loss the plastic network will incur by learning via the (often misleading because of the high \u03c3) environmental cues.\nA final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. ).\nThis means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment. As the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the (comparatively shorter) stays in each environment.\nFinally, as the environmental transition becomes too fast, the agents opt for slower or even no learning, which keeps them ) and the decision (b.) tasks, for a variety of parameters (p tr = 0.01, d e \u2208 0, 0.1, . . . , 1, and \u03c3 \u2208 0, 0.1, . . . , 1 in all 100 combinations). Despite the relatively small difference between the tasks, the evolved learning rules differ considerably.\nFor visual guidance, the lines connect \u03b8s from the same run. near the middle of the two environments, ensuring that the average loss of the two environments is minimal (Fig. ). The form of the evolved learning rule depends on the task: Decision vs. Prediction The plasticity parameters \u03b8 = (\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 8 ) for the rewardprediction task converge on approximately the same point, regardless of the environmental parameters (Fig. ).\nIn particular, \u03b8 3 \u2192 1, \u03b8 5 \u2192 \u22121, \u03b8 i \u2192 0 for all other i, and thus the learning rule converges to: Since by definition y t = g(W t X T t ) = W t X T t (g(x) = x in this experiment) and R t = W c X T t + \u03be we get: Thus the distribution of \u2206W t converges to a distribution with mean 0 and variance depending on \u03b7 p and \u03c3 and W converges to W c .\nSo this learning rule will match the agent's weight vector with the vector of ingredient values in the environment. We examine the robustness of the learning rule the EA discovers by considering a slight modification of our task. Instead of predicting the expected food value, the agent now needs to decide whether to eat the presented food or not.\nThis is done by introducing a step-function nonlinearity (g(x) = 1 if x \u2265 1 and 0 otherwise). Then the output y(t) is computed as: Instead of the MSE loss between prediction and actual value, the fitness of the agent is now defined as the sum of the food values it chose to consume (by giving y t = 1). Besides these two changes, the setup of the experiments remains exactly the same.\nThe qualitative relation between \u03b7 p and parameters of environment d e , \u03c3 and p tr is preserved in the changed experiment. However, the resulting learning rule is significantly different (Fig. ). The evolution converges to the following learning rule: In both cases, the rule has the form \u2206W t = \u03b7 p X t [\u03b1 y R t + \u03b2 y ].\nThus, the \u2206W t is positive or negative depending on whether the reward R t is above or below a threshold (\u03b3 = \u2212\u03b2 y \/\u03b1 y ) that depends on the output decision of the network (y t = 0 or 1). Both learning rules (for the reward-prediction and decision tasks) have a clear Hebbian form (coordination of preand post-synaptic activity) and use the incoming reward signal as a threshold.\nThese similarities indicate some common organizing principles of reward-modulated learning rules, but their significant differences highlight the sensitivity of the optimization process to task details. We now turn to the moving embodied agents in the 2D environment. To optimize these agents, both the motor network's connections and the sensory network's plasticity parameters evolve simultaneously.\nSince the motor network is initially random and the agent has to move to find food, the number of interactions an agent experiences in its lifetime can be small, slowing down the learning. However, having the larger motor network also has benefits for evolution because it allows the output of the plastic network to be read out and transformed in different ways, resulting in a broad set of solutions.\nThe fitness of an agent (measured as the total food consumed over its lifetime) increases over generations of the EA for both the scalar and binary readouts in the sensory network. e. The Pearson correlation coefficient of an evolved agent's weights with the ingredient value vector of the current environment (E 1 -blue, E 2 -red).\nIn this example, the agent's weights are anti-correlated with its environment, which is not an issue for performance since the motor network can interpret the inverted signs of food. The agents can solve the task effectively by evolving a functional motor network and a plasticity rule that converges to interpretable weights (Fig. ).\nAfter \u223c 100 evolutionary steps (Fig. ), the agents can learn the ingredient value distribution using the plastic network and reliably move towards foods with positive values while avoiding the ones with negative values. We compare the dependence of the moving and the static agents on the parameters of the environment: d e and the state transition probability p tr .\nAt first, in order to simplify the experiment, we set the transition probability to 0, but fixed the initial weights to be the average of E 1 and E 2 , while the real state is E 2 . In this experiment, the distance between states d e indicates twice the distance between the agent's initial weights and the optimal weights (the environment's ingredient values) since the agent is initialized at the mean of the two environment distributions.\nSame as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents.\nWe find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents.\nThis could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate \u03b7 p are largely maintained in the moving agents.\nStill, more data would be needed to make any conclusive assertions about the exact effect of these environmental parameters on the emerging plasticity mechanisms. A crucial difference between the static and the moving agents is the function the plasticity has to perform. While in the static agents, the plasticity has to effectively identify the exact value distribution of the environment in order to produce accurate predictions, in the embodied agents, the plasticity has to merely produce a representation of the environment that the motor network can evolve to interpret adequately enough to make decisions about which food to consume.\nTo illustrate the difference, we plot the Pearson correlation coefficient between an agent's weights and the ingredient values of the environment it is moving in (Fig. ). We use the correlation instead of the MSE loss (which we used for the static agents in Fig. ) because the amplitude of the vector varies a lot for different agents and meaningful The evolved parameters of moving agents' plasticity rule for the g(s) = x, identity (a.) and the step function (Eq.\n4) (b.) sensory networks (the environmental parameters here are d e \u2208 [0, 1], \u03c3 = 0 and p tr = 0.001). The step function (binary output) network evolved a more structured plasticity rule (e.g., \u03b8 3 > 0 for all realizations) than the linear network. Moreover, the learned weights for the identity network (c.) have higher variance and correlate significantly less with the environment's ingredient distribution compared to the learned weights for the thresholded network (d.)\nconclusions cannot be drawn from the MSE loss. For many agents, the learned weights are consistently anti-correlated with the actual ingredient values (an example of such an agent is shown in Fig. ). This means that the output of the sensory network will have the opposite sign from the actual food value.\nWhile in the static network, this would lead to very bad predictions and high loss, in the foraging task, these agents perform exactly as well as the ones where the weights and ingredients values are positively correlated, since the motor network can simply learn to move towards food for which it gets a negative instead of a positive sensory input.\nThis additional step of the output of the plastic network going through the motor network before producing any behavior has a strong effect on the plasticity rules that the embodied agents evolve. Specifically, if we look at the emerging rules the top performing agents have evolved (Fig. ), it becomes clear that, unlike the very well-structured rules of the static agents (Fig. ), there is now virtually no discernible pattern or structure.\nThe difference becomes even clearer if we look at the learned weights (at the end of a simulation) of the best-performing agents (Fig. ). While there is some correlation with the environment's ingredient value distribution, the variance is very large, and they do not seem to converge on the \"correct\" values in any way.\nThis is to some extent expected since, unlike the static agents where the network's output has to be exactly correct, driving the evolution of rules that converge to the precise environmental distribution, in the embodied networks, the bulk of the processing is done by the motor network which can evolve to interpret the scalar value of the sensory network's output in a variety of ways.\nThus, as long as the sensory network's plasticity rule co-evolves with the motor network, any plasticity rule that learns to produce consistent information about the value of encountered food can potentially be selected. To further test this assumption, we introduce a bottleneck of information propagation between the sensory and motor networks by using a step-function nonlinearity on the output of the sensory network (Eq.\n4). Similarly to the decision task of the static network, the output of the sensory network now becomes binary. This effectively reduces the flow of information from the sensory to the motor network, forcing the sensory network to consistently decide whether food should be consumed (with the caveat that the motor network can still interpret the binary sign in either of two ways, either consuming food marked with 1 or the ones marked with 0 by the sensory network).\nThe agents perform equally well in this variation of the task as before (Fig. ), but now, the evolved plasticity rules seem to be more structured (Fig. ). Moreover, the variance of the learned weights in the bestperforming agents is significantly reduced (Fig. ), which indicates that the bottleneck in the sensory network is in-creasing selection pressure for rules that learn the environment's food distribution accurately.\nWe find that different sources of variability have a strong impact on the extent to which evolving agents will develop neuronal plasticity mechanisms for adapting to their environment. A diverse environment, a reliable sensory system, and a rate of environmental change that is neither too large nor too small are necessary conditions for an agent to be able to effectively adapt via synaptic plasticity.\nAdditionally, we find that minor variations of the task an agent has to solve or the parametrization of the network can give rise to significantly different plasticity rules. Our results partially extend to embodied artificial agents performing a foraging task. We show that environmental variability also pushes the development of plasticity in such agents.\nStill, in contrast to the static agents, we find that the interaction of a static motor network with a plastic sensory network gives rise to a much greater variety of wellfunctioning learning rules. We propose a potential cause of this degeneracy; as the relatively complex motor network is allowed to read out and process the outputs from the plastic network, any consistent information coming out of these outputs can be potentially interpreted in a behaviorally useful way.\nReducing the information the motor network can extract from the sensory system significantly limits learning rule variability. Our findings on the effect of environmental variability concur with the findings of previous studies that have identified the constraints that environmental variability places on the evolutionary viability of learning behaviors.\nWe extend these findings in a mechanistic model which uses a biologically plausible learning mechanism (synaptic plasticity). We show how a simple evolutionary algorithm can optimize the different parameters of a simple reward-modulated plasticity rule for solving simple prediction and decision tasks.\nReward-modulated plasticity has been extensively studied as a plausible mechanism for credit assignment in the brain ; ; and has found several applications in artificial intelligence and robotics tasks ; . Here, we demonstrate how such rules can be very well-tuned to take into account different environmental parameters and produce optimal behavior in simple systems.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate how the co-evolution of plasticity and static functional connectivity in different subnetworks fundamentally changes the evolutionary pressures on the resulting plasticity rules, allowing for greater diversity in the form of the learning rule and the resulting learned connectivity.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated how, in biological networks, synaptic plasticity heavily interacts with and is driven by network topology . Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that biological plasticity mechanisms are highly redundant in the sense that any observed neural connectivity or recorded activity can be achieved with a variety of distinct, unrelated learning rules .\nThis observed redundancy of learning rules in biological settings complements our results and suggests that the function of plasticity rules cannot be studied independently of the connectivity and topology of the networks they are acting on. The optimization of functional plasticity in neural networks is a promising research direction both as a means to understand biological learning processes and as a tool for building more autonomous artificial systems.\nOur results suggest that reward-modulated plasticity is highly adaptable to different environments and can be incorporated into larger systems that solve complex tasks. This work studies a simplified toy model of neural network learning in stochastic environments. Future work could be built on this basic framework to examine more complex reward distributions and sources of environmental variability.\nMoreover, a greater degree of biological realism could be added by studying more plausible network architectures (multiple plastic layers, recurrent and feedback connections) and more sophisticated plasticity rule parametrizations. Additionally, our foraging simulations were constrained by limited computational resources and were far from exhaustive.\nFurther experiments can investigate environments with different constraints, food distributions, multiple seasons, more complex motor control systems and interactions of those systems with different sensory networks as well as the inclusion of plasticity on the motor parts of the artificial organisms.","label":"longbench","length":6354,"title":"Paper Info"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nMeg Griffin\nMeg Griffin is a fictional character in the animated television series Family Guy. Meg is the eldest child of Peter and Lois Griffin and older sister of Stewie and Chris, but is also the family's scapegoat who receives the least of their attention and tolerates the brunt of their abuse. She is often bullied, belittled, ridiculed, and ignored.\nMeg first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in a 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. She was created and designed by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, who was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company, based on The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve, two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the series pilot was given the greenlight, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \"Death Has a Shadow\".\nOriginally voiced by Lacey Chabert during the first season, Meg has been voiced by Mila Kunis since season 2.\n\nPersonality\nMeg is a self-conscious and insecure adolescent girl. She is treated unfairly and abused by various people and has numerous insecurities that prompt her to try to be part of the \"in-crowd\". However, this only results in her getting rebuffed by the many bullies of this circle, particularly Connie D'Amico, the head cheerleader of the local high school, James Woods Regional High School. However, a nerdy Jewish student named Neil Goldman is attracted to her.Meg is usually the butt of Peter's jokes due to her unpopularity and \"ugliness\"; Peter resorts to outrageous stunts and names. Stewie and Brian tend to disdain her kindness, but they typically do it behind Meg's back. Lois constantly puts Meg down, while boosting her own ego. Lois is usually of little to no help to Meg when she is abused by others; though her attitude is more negligent or apathetic than the more overt and direct abuse given by Peter.\nWhile Meg is usually a pushover, she can get angry when pushed too far, though such occasions are usually rare. This can be seen in the episode \"Seahorse Seashell Party\", where she strongly insults and defames Peter, Lois, and even Chris for their inconsiderate actions toward her. This causes Peter, Lois, and Chris to distance themselves in shame and sends Peter into depression; though she later apologizes upon realizing that the family needs a \"lightning rod\" to absorb the dysfunction. In the episode \"Road to Rupert\", Meg assaults a man for insulting her after a fender-bender.\nDespite her persistent mistreatment, Meg has proven a variety of times throughout the series that she is more talented and has greater potential than most people bother to realize, such as bird calls, playing the saxophone, speaking and singing in foreign languages, and even sports such as bowling, field hockey, basketball, roller derby, and even Olympic sports. However, she seldom earns any notable accolades for these abilities, mostly due to her family's lack of regard or interest in her or her inability to stick up against them.\nMany of the show's storylines about Meg involve her trying to improve her life, find a boyfriend, being a Russian sleeper agent, and reaching breaking points with her family and others who victimize her. She often becomes obsessed with men who show any kindness or affection to her, including the Griffin's friend and neighbor Joe Swanson in the episode \"The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair\", and Brian in \"Barely Legal\".\nOut of all the members of the family, her father Peter abuses her the most, however he is shown to actually care about Meg in various episodes, such as in \"Meg and Quagmire\" when he goes out of his way to prevent friend and neighbor Glenn Quagmire from having sex with her, and in \"This Little Piggy\" where he tries to get Meg out of a foot fetishism business objectifying her for men's sexual amusement. Peter occasionally cares about Meg but is not open about it to anyone.\n\nVoice actors\nOn the season 1 DVD commentary for the Drawn Together episode \"Hot Tub\", Cree Summer claims she was offered the role to play Meg but was dismissed by the producers. Meg was voiced by an uncredited Lacey Chabert for the first season, and by Mila Kunis in subsequent seasons after Chabert became busy with school and her role on Party of Five, although some of her work became second season episodes due to production order. Mila Kunis won the role after a series of auditions and callbacks where she was asked to speak more slowly and enunciate more; she was ultimately hired despite being unsure she understood what was expected of her. MacFarlane felt that Kunis invigorated the character, and that her work on That '70s Show showed she could command a scene. MacFarlane stated that Kunis \"had a very natural quality to Meg\" and she's \"in a lot of ways [...] almost more right for the character\". Kunis' voice is first heard as Meg in Episode 3 of season two \"Da Boom\", and the voices switch back and forth in the broadcast order until settling on Kunis. Tara Strong provides Meg's singing voice in \"Don't Make Me Over\". Archival recordings of Lacey Chabert's voice that she provided as Meg Griffin are used in the tenth season episode \"Back to the Pilot\" in which Brian and Stewie go back in time to the events of \"Death Has a Shadow\". However, Chabert does in fact return for the eleventh season episode \"Yug Ylimaf\" as Stewie references the fact that time has reversed so much that Meg's voice has reverted back from that of Kunis' to Chabert's.\n\nLacey Chabert (1999\u20132000; 2011 archive recordings, 2012)\nMila Kunis (1999\u2013present)\nTara Strong (singing voice)\n\nSocial life\nMeg is very unpopular in high school due to both her plain appearance and personality. She desperately tries to be part of the cool crowd, but is usually coldly rebuffed. Because of her eagerness for acceptance, she has been recruited \"unknowingly\" into a suicidal religious cult, and later recruited again unwittingly into her school's Lesbian Alliance (in the episode \"Brian Sings and Swings\" ). However, Meg does have a moderate number of friends, the best of whom being a group of girls who are often seen with her during occasions such as her slumber parties and gossiping about boys. In later episodes, these girls, known by the names Beth, Patty, Collette, Esther, and Ruth, are characterized as being highly unpopular and dateless, much like Meg.\nMeg is so unpopular at school that one student fires a nail gun into his own abdomen twice (in shop class) in order to avoid a date with her, and then in a later episode, another student shoots his own brother as an excuse not to go to a dance with her the following night. In \"Don't Make Me Over\", Lois is looking for new clothes for Meg, but with no luck; a saleswoman ends up pouring gasoline on herself, lighting a match, catching fire, and then jumping out of a window after looking at Meg in a pair of jeans. However, she is sought by nerd Neil Goldman. In \"8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter\", Neil starts dating a girl named Cecilia, Meg becomes instantly jealous and pretends to date Jake Tucker to make him jealous. This leads to her signing a contract to become Neil's girlfriend and (not knowing at first) his slave, but she gets him to tear up the contract after Lois seduces him. Perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire has shown a repeated interest in her, mostly due to his very low standards, asking if she has reached the age of consent. Quagmire comes close to succeeding in \"Meg and Quagmire\" when Lois tells Peter to back off after he was ruining Meg and Quagmire's 'dates'. Then, they rescue Meg after Glenn takes her to his cabin, Peter and Lois arriving in time before anything happens. In several episodes she is shown dating, including stories with characters Mayor Adam West and nudist Jeff Campbell. She also loses her virginity unknowingly on live television to Saturday Night Live host Jimmy Fallon after having a drastic makeover; but, before all that happens, she goes out with a rebel at her school named Craig Hoffman. In \"Jerome is the New Black\", Jerome, an old flame of Lois's and Peter's new friend, admits to having sex with Meg, to which Peter replies indifferently.\nIn the episode \"Brian Sings and Swings\", a lesbian student named Sarah invites Meg to join in her Lesbian Alliance Club, with Meg not knowing at first what kind of club it was. Desperate to fit in, she pretends to be a lesbian and also pretends to be attracted to Sarah and even goes so far as to kiss her to prove it. At the end of the episode, Meg goes over to Sarah's house to admit she lied about being a lesbian (Sarah thought that Meg came over to have sex and even undresses when Meg is telling her that she lied), much to Glenn's (who was hiding in Sarah's closet) disappointment. She also used to have a crush on anchorman Tom Tucker, but it ended after she discovered his vanity and selfishness. In other episodes, she is portrayed as chronically incapable of finding a boyfriend. For her Junior Prom she accepts a pity date from Brian, the family dog and only after threatening suicide.Earlier in season 2, she dated Joe Swanson's son Kevin Swanson, but in \"Stew-Roids\" it is mentioned that Kevin died in Iraq. In the episode, \"Prick Up Your Ears\", she dates a boy named Doug, but he breaks up with her when he sees her naked right before almost having sex. In the episode \"Peter's Daughter\", Meg falls in love with a medical student named Michael Milano after coming out of a short coma (caused by Peter when he asked her to \"rescue\" beer and make him a sandwich out of an already flooded kitchen) and they start to date. After he breaks up with Meg (because of Peter being overprotective of her after promising that if she came out of the coma, he would \"treat her like a princess\"), she announces that she is pregnant by Michael and the two get engaged. After finding out that she is not actually pregnant, Meg tells Michael the truth hoping that he will stay, however, Michael quickly leaves Meg at the altar. In the episode \"Dial Meg for Murder\", she is dating a convict, while in the episode \"Go, Stewie, Go!\" she dates an attractive young man named Anthony, who is absolutely normal (much to the surprise of many of the other characters). They were so shocked that they had to do tests just to see if he was completely normal which annoyed Meg. It is presumed that she broke up with him after he and Lois had an affair. Meg also shows extremely possessive behavior when she encounters someone she believes she has a romantic connection with such as kidnapping Brian and detaining Bonnie Swanson at the airport by planting a gun in her purse.\nOverall, Meg has shown romantic interest in and dated several men throughout the series. However, there have been several instances in which she has shown hints of being bisexual or a lesbian: examples of this include \"Brian Sings and Swings\", \"Stew-Roids\", and \"Dial Meg for Murder\".\nIn November 2016, when asked by Splitsider if the writers will further develop the characters of Chris and Meg in future episodes, showrunner Alec Sulkin confirmed that the series crew members are working on doing so and added that there are plans for an episode where Meg comes out as a lesbian, taking inspiration from previous instances in which she exhibited signs of lesbian characteristics, like when she joins a lesbian alliance group at school in \"Brian Sings and Swings\" and is identified as a \"transgender man\" named \"Ron\" in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, the latter which takes place in the future. However, Sulkin also noted that the plotline has not yet been finalized and thus isn't officially set to be used in an episode.\n\nFamily life\nIn the first three seasons of the show, Meg was portrayed with a more whiny and uptight personality who was often embarrassed by the family\u2019s acts of bumbling and stupidity, though they cared for her and meant well. In the post-cancellation seasons, this began to change as the inadvertent embarrassment became deliberate bullying and disrespect. Additionally, the show started to flesh out the characters to the point where it appears that most of the population of Quahog who knows her, or even just meets her, picks on or disdains her for no reason other than her simply being \"Meg\". This basically means that she is a victim of circumstance, as Meg is normally docile and well-behaved and never seems to do anything mean or inconsiderate. In an interview, Mila Kunis stated: \"Meg gets picked on a lot. But it's funny. It's like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 16-year-old, when you're kind of going through puberty and what-not. She's just in perpetual mode of humiliation, and it's fun.\"While Meg is, in reality, the least obnoxious or self-involved of the family, she is also the least respected and most misunderstood, often shown by people avoiding her company, disparaging her in person, gathering in her bedroom to read her diary for laughs, etc. Peter reminds Lois, \"We agreed that if we could only save two, we'd leave Meg!\" even randomly shooting her when she simply said \"Hi Dad\" (\"Peter's Daughter\") but despite this he also was going to say \"I love you\" in \"Hell Comes to Quahog\", and in \"Road to Rupert\" he stated they were 'secret best friends' before throwing lemonade in her face, saying he would have to continue to treat her badly in public in order to maintain his reputation due to \"peer pressure\", thus giving hope that they may be on good terms. Occasionally, when Meg asks a question to Peter or just speaks when he is in the room, Peter responds by saying \"Shut up, Meg\", which is immediately followed by a line from another character.\nWhen the family tries an anger management technique of writing letters and not sending them, Meg finds Peter's letter to her, which says, \"Dear Meg, for the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat.\" And in Peter's short story of her birth, they had to go back to get her once they realized they grabbed the afterbirth. In the episode \"Stewie Kills Lois\", Peter tells guests on a cruise ship about how he and Lois had gone to get an abortion but decided against it when they arrived at the clinic and found out the abortionist had one hand. He then says \"two and a half months later, our daughter Meg was born\" \u2013 indicating that they had tried to abort her when Lois was already over six months pregnant. Another hint to this is when Meg is in the car with Lois and at an attempt to make civilized conversation, says, \"Hey Meg, did you know that if you're on birth control and you take an antibiotic it makes it not work? 'Cause no one told me! I just thought you should know\" and laughs awkwardly. On Meg's 17th birthday, her mother and father both try to hide from Meg that they do not remember her age. Peter states that Meg sucks in the episode \"PTV\", and Chris says that people think the same thing about her in \"Long John Peter\". In \"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\", Brian says to Meg's face that she lives in a home \"where nobody respects or cares about [her], not even enough to get [her] a damn mumps shot!\" Chris, however, has more of a typical brother-sister relationship with Meg, with Chris telling those who condemn her that it is never her fault. Chris, at one point, threatened to quit his job at the local mini-mart if his boss didn't re-hire Meg (at the insistence of Lois). Like Chris, Meg has an anthropomorphic monkey in her closet, and although she has proved it, her father coldly state that they were talking about Chris', not hers. Cleveland comments to Peter \"Meg is my least favorite of your children.\"Apparently, a double standard also exists against Meg, further underscoring the mistreatment she suffers from the people around her. In \"Big Man on Hippocampus\", an episode wherein Peter loses his memory, as he reacquaints himself with the pleasures of sex, Lois tells him that it is inappropriate to have sex with his own children; in response, Meg attempts an incest joke. She then lambastes her for this and kicks her out of the room. However, in the season finale \"Partial Terms of Endearment\", Lois tells a joke that implies that it was Meg that gave birth to Stewie, and apart from a shocked reaction from the latter, Lois receives no such violent reaction. Additionally, in \"Model Misbehavior\", when Lois starts a modeling career, Peter states that he will pleasure himself to Lois' pictures, followed by Chris and Meg both exclaiming \"Me too!\" to which Peter shouts \"Oh God, Meg, that's sick! That's your mother!\", ignoring the fact that Chris said the same thing first. Meg responded by saying \"I was only trying to fit in!\" Peter immediately kicked her out of the house. Later, during an unrelated conversation, when she tried to insight Peter on how Lois' behavior from modeling made a poor example for women, he said \"Meg, who let you back in the house?\"\nBrian's attention initially softens the lack of respect from Peter and the rest of family; he admits that he cares for Meg when she goes out with Mayor Adam West. While initially seeming to have more common decency for Meg than most people, this appears to almost completely disappear after the tenth season, as Brian's increasingly shallow and self-centered character begins to take more pleasure and joy in being rotten to Meg and often refuses to give her the time of day, such as desperately trying to avoid having to comfort her, rejecting an offer by Peter to be Meg's godfather, attempting to pin the blame on (or trying to frame) her for a misdeed, finding humor in her being puked on, and even willing to deliberately urinate on her bed. Meg's most complicated relationship among the family members after Peter would be with her mother Lois. Although not as abusive as Peter, Lois seldom (if ever) reprimands her husband for their treatment of their daughter and tends to be rather thoughtless of Meg herself, often putting her down for her lack of social achievement or social popularity. Throughout the series, Lois can best be described as a general foil to her daughter, being more rebellious, outgoing, and loose-spirited compared to her daughter's own uptight demeanor, easily-embarrassed personality, and lack of confidence. Before the more recent seasons of the series, Lois has also often shown sympathy for Meg and tried to boost her confidence in terms of teenage social matters. Occasionally however, such occasions resulted in the former getting carried away and stealing the show, for example, taking her to Spring Break at the beach, only for her former younger wild side to kick in and completely exclude Meg from the excitement. Lois would very often comfort Meg when she is down; however, she gives up one attempt after 45 minutes and gives her a Sylvia Plath novel and a bottle of Ambien, and with a \"Whatever happens, happens\", leaves Meg to her misery.\nOne of the most cruel examples of the family's lack of humanity or gratitude for Meg comes in the episode \"You Can't Do That On Television, Peter\". When Peter is mauled by a puma, Meg uses medical training to save his life. However, no one thanks her afterward and when she tries to point it out, Peter just tells her to get him water.\nThe family's treatment of Meg finally reaches her limit in \"Dial Meg for Murder\" when Meg emerges from a short stint in a Young Offenders Institution as a hardened criminal, abusing her family and beating up anyone who makes fun of her. It is only after a conversation with Brian that she changes her ways. However, it comes to a head once again in \"Seahorse Seashell Party\", when Meg finally grows tired of her mistreatment and lashes out against Lois and Peter, informing them of their own flaws. Lois condescendingly tells Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else invoking Meg to bring up her mother's delinquent past. Meg tells her that she is far from the perfect parent, harshly berates her for constantly and ruthlessly pointing out Meg's shortcomings. Lois tries to justify that she's a better person because of her past and she is open that she isn't the perfect parent, but Meg tells her that she's the farthest thing from and states how she has neglected to guide her through life and navigate her through the hardships and difficulties of being a young woman. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns 18, she may never want to see her again. This breaks Lois' heart and she finally admits that she's been a terrible mother to Meg. Finally, Meg turns on Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing, even when she points out Peter's destructive tendencies and that he would go to jail if someone could witness his negative treatment towards her. It dawns on Peter that he is being insulted when Meg calls him a \"waste of a man.\" A disillusioned Peter asks Lois to tell Meg to \"knock it off\", but Lois refuses because he didn't stick up for her. Within moments, Peter turns his abusive criticisms and insults on Chris and Lois. Peter finally runs to his room crying, with Lois running after him, leaving behind Meg and Brian, who is now fully recovered from his trip, to discuss what just happened. Brian likes that Meg stood up for herself, but she sadly tells him that even though she meant every word, seeing Peter turn on everyone like wolves has made her think that it is ultimately her non-ideal role to serve as the Griffins' \"lightning rod that absorbs all the dysfunction\". He commends her on her maturity, and even goes on to say that Meg is the \"strongest person\" in the family. She soon apologizes to the others and says that she is actually the one at fault.\nSince this episode, the abuse that Meg receives begins to fade away as a storyline. She also notices that Peter's pro wrestler sister Karen treats Peter exactly the way Peter treats her, and they bond over this with a plan to embarrass Karen at a wrestling show\u2014which goes awry when Meg hits her with a metal folding chair instead of a breakaway one and injures Karen to the point where she ends up in a coma and (as it is implied) possibly will die from her injuries without a blood transfusion.\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nList of Family Guy cast members\nFamily Guy is an American animated sitcom that features five main voice actors, and numerous regular cast and recurring guest stars. The principal voice cast consists of show creator Seth MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Mila Kunis (who replaced Lacey Chabert after the first season (her last episode is \"Holy Crap,\" now marketed as the second episode of season two)), Seth Green, and Mike Henry. Recurring voice actors include Patrick Warburton, Adam West, John G. Brennan, Nicole Sullivan and Jennifer Tilly, and repeat guest stars include Phyllis Diller, Charles Durning, Rush Limbaugh, James Woods and Phil LaMarr.\nMany cast members provide voices for multiple characters. The voice actors, in portraying the various character personalities on the show, draw inspiration from celebrities and pop culture. Family Guy characters have been played by more than one actor, after members of the show left the series or had conflicting obligations.\nKunis was nominated for an Annie Award for voicing Meg Griffin in the season 5 episode \"Barely Legal\" and MacFarlane has also won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production, though no other cast member has won an award for their work on the series.\n\nCurrent cast\nFrom seasons 1 to 4, Family Guy had four main cast members. Since season 5, there have been five main cast members. The casting of Meg Griffin changed after season 1.\n\nSeth MacFarlane\nSeth MacFarlane voices four of the show's main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he had already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. The voice for Glenn Quagmire is based on 1940s and 1950s radio commercials. MacFarlane uses his own voice while portraying Brian.MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time only characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker, Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman.  He is the only cast member to be in every episode.\n\nAlex Borstein\nAlex Borstein voices Lois Griffin, Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was \"really sight unseen\". At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redhead mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. The voice was originally slower (and deeper for the original season), but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied \"Make it a little less fucking annoying ... and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours.\"\n\nSeth Green\nSeth Green primarily plays Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman. Green stated that he did an impression of the \"Buffalo Bill\" character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition. His main inspiration for Chris' voice came from envisioning how \"Buffalo Bill\" would sound if he were speaking through a public address system at a McDonald's.\n\nMila Kunis\nMila Kunis voices Meg Griffin. Kunis won the role after the auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. Kunis described her character as \"the scapegoat\". She further explained, \"Meg gets picked on a lot. But it's funny. It's like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 14-year-old, when you're kind of going through puberty and what-not. She's just in a perpetual mode of humiliation. And it's fun.\"\n\nMike Henry\nMike Henry is the voice of Cleveland Brown, John Herbert \u201cThe Pervert\u201d, Bruce, Consuela, and various other characters. A Family Guy writer and producer, he began acting on the show as part of the recurring cast repertory (see below) but was promoted to main cast member in 2005. Since the cancellation of The Cleveland Show, he also voices Cleveland's step-son Rallo Tubbs on Family Guy. On June 26, 2020, after twenty years of voicing the character, Mike Henry announced on Twitter that he was stepping down from voicing Cleveland, stating \"persons of color should play characters of color.\" On September 25, 2020, it was announced that Arif Zahir would take over as the voice of Cleveland.\n\nRecurring cast\nIn addition to both its main cast and guest stars, Family Guy utilizes a deep bench of regularly appearing supporting voice actors. Some appear in nearly every episode each season, while others appear less frequently. Some of these actors specifically play recurring characters, while others mainly play background citizens of Quahog or characters in cutaway gags.\nThe current supporting cast repertory includes the following actors:\n\nIn addition to the above, the following actors were formerly regularly recurring voice actors in the series:\n\nRecurring guest voices\nThe recurring guest voices include Adam Carolla as Death, Patrick Stewart as Susie Swanson, Scott Grimes as Kevin Swanson, Sanaa Lathan as Donna Tubbs Brown and Emily Osment as Ruth Cochamer. Previous recurring guests included Phyllis Diller in three episodes as Peter's Mother, Thelma, and Charles Durning as Peter's father, Francis. Both characters have since died, but Durning returned once to play Francis as a ghost. Early in the show's run, Fred Willard and Jane Lynch had a recurring role as a family of nudists and James Woods as himself. In 2020, it was announced that Sam Elliott would take over as Quahog's new mayor, Mayor West's estranged cousin Wyld West.\n\nCasting changes\nLacey Chabert voiced Meg for the first production season (14 episodes), but, because of a contractual agreement, was never credited. Chabert left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in Party of Five, as well as schoolwork.\nJon Cryer voiced Kevin Swanson in his first appearance before the role passed to Seth MacFarlane. The character was written out of the series for several years, with Scott Grimes taking over the voice when the character returned.\nFairuza Balk was the original voice of high school bully Connie D'Amico until Lisa Wilhoit took over the character from the third to eighteenth seasons.\nNatasha Melnick was the original voice of Meg Griffin's Friend Ruth Cochamer until Emily Osment took over the character in the eleventh season.\nBeginning in 2021-onward, Arif Zahir took over voicing Cleveland Brown from Mike Henry.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also\nTelevision portal\nPassage 3:\nThe Cleveland Show\nThe Cleveland Show is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Richard Appel, and Mike Henry for the Fox Broadcasting Company. A spin-off of Family Guy, and the second television series in the franchise, the series centers on Cleveland Brown, his new wife Donna Tubbs-Brown, and their children Cleveland Brown Jr., Roberta Tubbs, and Rallo Tubbs. Similar to Family Guy, it exhibited much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture, though it uses significantly fewer than Family Guy. Fox cancelled the series after 4 seasons. The animation was produced by Fox Television Animation.\nThe series was conceived by MacFarlane in 2007 after developing Family Guy and American Dad! for the Fox network. MacFarlane centered the show on Family Guy character Cleveland Brown and created new characters for Cleveland's family members. One preexisting character, Cleveland's son Cleveland Jr. (Junior), was redesigned as an obese, soft-spoken teen, as opposed to his depiction as a younger, hyperactive child with average body weight on Family Guy.\nThe series premiered on September 27, 2009, and ended on May 19, 2013, with a total of 88 episodes over the course of 4 seasons. The Cleveland Show was nominated for one Annie Award, one Primetime Emmy Award, and two Teen Choice Awards, but received mixed reviews from media critics. Nearly a year after the series' cancelation, Cleveland returned to Family Guy, accompanied by the rest of the Brown-Tubbs family, in the season 12 episode \"He's Bla-ack!\" during which his show was mercilessly mocked by his friends.\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nSeth MacFarlane initially conceived The Cleveland Show in 2007 while working on his other two animated series, Family Guy and American Dad!.\n\nThe Cleveland Show first appeared on the development slate at Fox in early 2008, under no official name for the pilot, after a report that Fox had purchased the series from creators. The pilot was named The Cleveland Show in May 2008, when it appeared on the primetime slate for the 2008\u201309 television season, although it wasn't officially on the network schedule. Shortly after a report that King of the Hill just ended, leaving air time for The Cleveland Show, the show was picked up for a full season after an additional nine episodes of the show were ordered. In May 2009, The Cleveland Show appeared on the primetime slate for the 2009\u201310 television season, for airing on Sunday nights at 8:30 pm On June 15, 2009, it was announced that The Cleveland Show would premiere on September 27, 2009.MacFarlane and Henry pitched a 22-minute to Fox which aired on September 27, 2009 but had been leaked on the internet in June 2009. Even before the pilot episode premiered, the show had already been renewed for a 22-episode second season. After the first season of the show aired, it was given the green light to start production. On June 10, 2010, less than three weeks into the first season's summer hiatus, it was announced that Fox was ordering a third season. A fourth season was announced on May 9, 2011, just a few days before the second season concluded.\n\nExecutive producers\nSeth MacFarlane, Mike Henry and Richard Appel have served as executive producers on the series since the first season.\n\nVoice cast\nMike Henry voices two of the show's main characters: Cleveland Brown and Rallo Tubbs. The voice of Cleveland was developed originally for Family Guy by Henry after being influenced by one of his best friends who had a very distinct regional accent. For the voice of Rallo, Henry stated that he created the voice over twenty years before; he had used it while making prank phone calls.\nSanaa Lathan voices Donna Tubbs, the wife of Cleveland, stepmother of Cleveland Brown Jr., and mother of Roberta and Rallo Tubbs. In developing the character, Lathan said that the producers \"wanted her to be educated, but to have some edge.\" Prior to voicing Donna, Lathan had only one other voice credit in a relatively low-budget film entitled The Golden Blaze. In addition to the show, she also primarily worked as an actress in such films as Alien vs. Predator, Blade, Love & Basketball and The Family That Preys.\nReagan Gomez-Preston plays Roberta Tubbs, the stepdaughter of Cleveland. Gomez has stated that she uses her own voice to portray Roberta and that she herself gets mistaken for a fifteen-year-old over the phone \"all the time.\" Before Gomez was cast as Roberta, Nia Long (who co-starred with Lathan in The Best Man franchise) provided the character's voice during the first thirteen episodes. According to Long, she was replaced because producers decided they wanted an actress with a younger-sounding voice, given that the character is a teenager.Kevin Michael Richardson, a recurring guest voice on Family Guy and American Dad!, portrays Cleveland, Jr., as well as Cleveland's next-door neighbor Lester Krinklesac. In portraying Cleveland, Jr., Richardson drew inspiration from a character named Patrick that he had played on the NBC drama series ER who was mentally impaired and wore a football helmet. For Lester, Richardson stated in an interview that, being African American, he had \"run into a few rednecks in [his] time\", and decided to simply perform a stereotypical redneck impression for the voice of Lester.Jason Sudeikis plays Holt Richter, one of Cleveland's drinking buddies with short stature, and Terry Kimple, one of Cleveland's longtime friends who now works with him at Waterman Cable. Sudeikis originally began as a recurring cast member, but starting with the episode \"Harder, Better, Faster, Browner\", he was promoted to a series regular.\nSeth MacFarlane played Tim the Bear up until season 3 episode 10, which MacFarlane admits is a \"Steve Martin impression [...] a Wild and Crazy Guy impression\". Jess Harnell voices the character for the rest of the series from the next episode onward, as MacFarlane grew tired of voicing the character.\nOther voices include that of Arianna Huffington as Tim's wife Arianna the Bear, Nat Faxon as Tim and Arianna's son Raymond the Bear, Jamie Kennedy as Roberta's boyfriend Gabriel Friedman, a.k.a. \" Federline Jones\", Will Forte as Principal Wally, Frances Callier as Evelyn \"Cookie\" Brown, Craig Robinson as LeVar \"Freight Train\" Brown and David Lynch as Gus the bartender.\n\nCharacters\nCleveland's newly introduced family includes his new wife, Donna Tubbs-Brown (voiced by Sanaa Lathan); Donna's daughter Roberta (originally voiced by Nia Long, but later voiced by Reagan Gomez-Preston); and Donna's son Rallo (voiced by Mike Henry). Cleveland, Jr. underwent a complete redesign for the show, becoming sensitive and soft-spoken.\n\nEpisodes\nCrossovers with other animated sitcoms\nThe Cleveland Show characters have appeared on other animated sitcoms and vice versa. The Cleveland Show crossovers have all involved two other animated programs. Both the other two animated programs were also created by Seth MacFarlane\u2014Family Guy and American Dad!. There are also many brief cameos of characters from three other Fox animated shows, The Simpsons, Futurama, and King of the Hill.\n\nSyndication and streaming\nIn July 2010, the Turner Broadcasting System picked up syndication rights, for their networks TBS and later, Adult Swim. The series first aired on Adult Swim in the United States on September 29, 2012. On July 14, 2018, Viacom later picked up the rights to the series and the series left Adult Swim and TBS on September 9, 2018. The series began airing on Comedy Central in the United States on October 8, 2018 until April 29, 2022 with ViacomCBS sister networks BET and VH1 airing the series starting on August 31, 2020 and September 14, 2020, respectively. The series is available for streaming on Hulu.\nThe series began airing on FXX on September 20, 2021.Internationally, The Cleveland Show is available to stream on Star on Disney+.\n\nCancellation\nOn April 17, 2013, Fox dismissed increasing rumors that The Cleveland Show had been canceled, reporting rather that renewal of the series was undetermined as of that time. However, on May 13, 2013, in the New York Daily News, Fox Chairman of Entertainment Kevin Reilly confirmed the show's cancellation. Following the series cancellation, it was confirmed that Cleveland would be moving back to Quahog with the rest of the Brown-Tubbs family to rejoin the Family Guy cast.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nThe Cleveland Show initially received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Metacritic gave the show a score of 57 out of 100. Tom Shales of The Washington Post spoke very negatively about both the show and MacFarlane himself, describing him as \"no better than the dirty old man hanging around playgrounds with naughty pictures or risque jokes as lures\". Roberto Bianco of USA Today wrote a similarly negative review, suggesting that the easiest fix for its problem was \"cancellation\". John McWhorter of The New Republic called it \"a patronizing mess\" and \"basically Family Guy in blackface\". He added: \"What isn't black in it is so shamelessly ripped off from Family Guy that it's hard to believe it's the product of creators who are usually so studiously 'post-' obvious stunts of the sort.\"Matt Rouse of TV Guide wrote, \"The lamest, most unnecessary spin-off since Private Practice, Cleveland rests on the shoulders of the hopelessly bland title character\". However, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was more positive about the program, writing that although The Cleveland Show was \"just as rude-crude\" as Family Guy, it also had \"more warmth\" due to Cleveland being a more likable character than Peter Griffin. Owen also praised the character of Tim the Bear, stating that \"Tim is by far the most amusing creation.\" Jonathan Storm of the Philadelphia Inquirer, also spoke positively, stating that \"[Cleveland] sounds funnier, and he shows way more personality than we've seen in his many years on Family Guy. [...] While it seems to be missing some of the over-the-top offensive bites we're used to on Family Guy, and Cleveland's new drinking buddies aren't quite as amusing as the Quagmire, Joe, and Peter combination - there's a lot to like here.\"\n\nNielsen ratings\nAwards and nominations\nHome media\nInternationally The Cleveland Show is available to stream on Star on Disney + with all four seasons.\nPassage 4:\nBig Chuck and Lil' John\nCharles \"Big Chuck\" Schodowski (born June 28, 1934) and \"Lil' John\" Rinaldi (born January 19, 1946) \u2013 together commonly known as Big Chuck and Lil' John \u2013 are a duo of entertainers who served as late-night horror hosts of The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show on television station WJW in Cleveland, Ohio from 1963 to 2008.  In addition to hosting a movie with a live audience, they also performed original sketch comedy routines.  At the end of each sketch was a very distinctive laugh (see external links section below) voiced by comedian\/actor Jay Lawrence, who was a disc jockey for KYW radio in Cleveland during the early 1960s.\nOn September 10, 2011, WJW began airing a weekly half-hour program \u2013 simply titled Big Chuck and Lil' John \u2013 featuring classic show skits along with limited new production.\n\nHistory\nChuck Schodowski (b. June 28, 1934) started as a producer\/engineer at WJW-TV (and before that at KYW-TV), and became a close friend of Ernie Anderson. When Anderson's previous sidekick, eventual Hollywood actor Tim Conway, was fired for a fabrication on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Schodowski was hired as Conway's replacement. Schodowski worked closely with Anderson (as Ghoulardi) on Shock Theater, and was instrumental in bringing in the blend of blues and polka music that helped define the show, adding comic audio drop-ins to enliven the often awful movies, and immortalized The Rivingtons' tune \"Papa Oom Mow Mow\" by marrying it to the image of an old man gurning.When Anderson left Cleveland for California in 1966, his popular Ghoulardi character was retired, and a talent search ensued to find a replacement. Schodowski agreed to help Bob Wells (WJW's \"Hoolihan the Weatherman\") with his audition, and the management decided they liked the way the two performed together. They became co-hosts of The Hoolihan and Big Chuck Show, which launched on December 23, 1966. In addition to screening horror films, the duo soon started filming comedy skits interspersed within the host segments.After Wells left the show in 1979, John Rinaldi, a jeweler by trade who had already been featured on many of the program's skits, took over as co-host. The show itself was relaunched as The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show, and while effectively a separate and distinct show, the familiar Catch As Catch Can theme was retained, among other show elements. Moreover, taped skits from the preceding show often would be rerun on The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show through various \"oldies nights\".\nFor many years, the show aired at 11:30 p.m. on Friday nights before moving to 11:30 p.m. on Saturday nights starting on October 1, 1988 (to accommodate The Arsenio Hall Show, which WJW was airing following their weeknight 11 p.m. newscasts), then back to Fridays following WJW's affiliation switch to Fox in 1994.\nAfter Fox acquired WJW in 1996, the movies selected for The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show were no longer done by either host, and began to deviate from the original horror\/science fiction genre into more conventional movie fare. In addition, the start time was again moved in 1996 to Saturdays at midnight following Mad TV, then after Fox debuted Talkshow with Spike Feresten in 2006, the show settled in its final start time of 12:30 a.m. Saturday nights\/Sunday mornings.\nAlong with the Saturday night shows, Schodowski and Rinaldi hosted a companion Couch Potato Theater program airing from 10 a.m. - noon on Saturday mornings, which featured at various times Three Stooges shorts, episodes of The Abbott and Costello Show, movies, cartoons, or (due to schedule conflicts) an hour long skits only show.In December 2006, Schodowski announced he would retire in June 2007.  As part of his farewell, WJW broadcast the hour-long retrospective Big Chuck and Lil' John: The End of an Era.\nThis also marked the end of The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show, with the last regular episode airing the afternoon of June 16, 2007 and again in the early morning of June 17.In October 2008, Schodowski released his autobiography, Big Chuck!: My Favorite Stories from 47 Years on Cleveland TV, co-written by The Plain Dealer media writer Tom Feran. The book debuted at the 2008 Ghoulardifest convention.\nDuring the summer of 2011, it was announced that Big Chuck and Lil' John would return to TV on WJW every Saturday morning at 11 a.m. (this time, in a 30-minute all skits show similar to the Couch Potato Theater format).  This version of the show began on September 10, 2011. In 2015, the show was moved to Sunday nights at 11:30 p.m. The show moved to Monday mornings at 12:30 a.m. in 2021, and as of July 2021 the show has been retitled The Best of Big Chuck and Lil' John and introductions to the skits have been dropped.Lil' John made news in December 2014, after Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis referred to Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel as a \"midget\". WJW sent the 4'3\" Rinaldi to Cincinnati to cover Lewis' weekly press conference, and he asked the coach some questions.In 2019 the duo reunited with Wells to film the five-episode web series Space Ship One.\n\nNotable sketches and parodies\nBen Crazy - a parody of a popular 60's TV medical drama, Ben Casey with Big Chuck as the title character. Originated on Hoolihan & Big Chuck, but had additional sketches filmed throughout the entire run of Big Chuck & Lil' John.\nThe Certain Ethnic _____ - a play on Big Chuck's Polish heritage featuring Chuck as \"Stash Kowalski\" \u2013 a stereotypical Polish Clevelander (e.g., The Certain Ethnic Motorist, who drives through red traffic lights and stops at green lights). Big Chuck specifically created the term \"certain ethnic\" as a euphemism for \"Polish\".\nThe Kielbasa Kid - a parody of TV westerns, with Big Chuck as the bumbling hero. Originated on Hoolihan & Big Chuck.\nReadings By Robert - originated on Hoolihan & Big Chuck as a carbon copy of an Ernie Kovacs routine, with Bob Wells in the title role (patterned after Kovacs' \"Percy Dovetonsils\" character), and Big Chuck as his jazz-ukulele-playing assistant, Carlos. Occasionally rerun throughout the entire run of Big Chuck & Lil' John.\nParma Place - a parody of the 60's soap-opera Peyton Place. Originated on Ghoulardi but was continuously rerun throughout the entire course of Hoolihan & Big Chuck and Big Chuck & Lil' John\nSoul Man - a parody of Superman where Big Chuck (as \"Ed Tarboosh\"  \u2013  mild mannered TV producer) would \u2013 with the help of his \"soul pills\" \u2013 become Soul Man, who was a big, black, and bumbling superhero (played by longtime station cameraman Herb Thomas).  Originated on Hoolihan & Big Chuck.\nMary Hartski, Mary Hartski - a parody of the 70's TV show Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\nMariano \"Mushmouth\" Pacetti - king of the weekly \"Pizza Fight\" during a six-year period on Hoolihan & Big Chuck.\nCuyahoga Jones and the Castle of Doom - a parody of the Indiana Jones series, with Big Chuck as the title character \u2013 and Lil' John as his sidekick \"Short Stuff\" \u2013 chronicling their attempts to capture the \"Kapusta Diamond\". These skits were filmed at Squire's Castle in suburban Willoughby Hills, Ohio.\n\nOther cast members\nBig Chuck and Lil' John would use some of WJW's personalities, like station meteorologist Dick Goddard, in their skits.  A popular Goddard sketch revolved around Goddard's claims that WJW had the best doppler radar in Cleveland.  He bragged that WJW's \"Super Doppler Google-Plex\" was powerful enough to see clearly to a neighborhood, close enough to reveal a woman taking a bath (strategically covered with bubbles) through her bathroom sunroof, as Goddard sheepishly tried to hide the image with his suit jacket.  Goddard would appear in numerous skits through the years, sometimes even playing different characters.Other longtime supporting players were veteran cameraman\/technician Art Lofredo, who appeared in many skits through the years (most frequently as \"The Old Man\") and had several \"Art Lofredo Nights\" dedicated to him;  Herb Thomas, a longtime station cameraman who portrayed \"Soul Man\", and Mary Allen (\"the pride of Maple Heights\"), who was an older lady and was a viewer who had won an auction in the late 70s to appear on a skit.  She impressed Big Chuck with her performance so much, she became a regular player on the show until the late 90s, appearing most frequently as Stash Kowalski's wife Stella in \"The Certain Ethnic ______\" skits.News anchor Robin Swoboda was famously featured as the main villain (a Catwoman takeoff) with several Cleveland Browns players portraying her henchmen in \"Batguy & Rinaldi\" (a parody of Batman & Robin), and sportscasters Casey Coleman, John Telich and Dan Coughlin were used in sports themed skits. Other later skits featured WJW station announcer Bill Ward announcing introductions to skits or for faux testimonial advertisements in the style of Hoolihan.\nOwing to the station's long affiliation with the CBS television network, CBS stars like Buddy Ebsen and Andy Griffith made cameos in several skits, as well as Tim Conway (who like Big Chuck began his career on WJW as a sidekick of Ernie Anderson \u2013 though on a separate program) who by then was a star on CBS' The Carol Burnett Show. Athletes like Muhammad Ali, Earnie Shavers and Jack Lambert also made guest appearances in skits.\n\nOther show features\nBoth The Hoolihan and Big Chuck Show and The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show also made music video parodies as well, including Ray Stevens songs like \"Gitarzan\", \"Indian Love Call\" (the skit was titled \"The Audio Engineer\" and made extensive use of chromakey), \"Along Came Jones\", \"The Streak\" and \"Bridget the Midget\" (which was Lil' John's on-air debut on the show back in 1970), plus other songs like Scott McKenzie's \"San Francisco\", Jimmy Castor Bunch's \"Troglodyte\", and Larry Groce's \"Junk Food Junkie.\"\nBoth shows occasionally would feature a \"New Talent Time\" sketch where Cleveland area performers, usually performing some sort of offbeat stunt, would be featured. One week featured songwriter Robert McGuire performing his original song \"Moon Over Parma\", a song that mentioned a journey through the suburbs of Cleveland; the song would later become the theme song for the first season of The Drew Carey Show.\n\nAwards and honors\nBig Chuck\n29-time Lower Great Lakes Emmy Awards recipient\n1994 Silver Circle Award, presented by Local Great Lakes Emmy Awards chapter\nOhio Broadcasters Hall of Fame Inductee (class of 1991)\nCleveland Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame (class of 1999)\n\nLil' John\n1995 Silver Circle Award, presented by Local Great Lakes Emmy Awards chapter\n2001 Lower Great Lakes Emmy Award recipient (as co-host of The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show) - Regularly Scheduled Entertainment Program\nOhio Broadcasters Hall of Fame Inductee (class of 1996)\nCleveland Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame (class of 1999)\nPassage 5:\nCleveland Bulldogs\nThe Cleveland Bulldogs were a team that played in Cleveland, Ohio in the National Football League. They were originally called the Indians in 1923, not to be confused with the Cleveland Indians NFL franchise in 1922. However, after team owner Samuel Deutsch purchased the Canton Bulldogs in 1924, he merged the Canton team with his Indians and renamed his franchise the Cleveland Bulldogs. The Canton Bulldogs remained a part of the team until 1925, when they were sold back to Canton. The Cleveland Bulldogs played in the NFL until 1928 when they were relocated to Detroit and became the Detroit Wolverines. The team was later incorporated into the New York Giants in 1929. The Cleveland Bulldogs won the 1924 NFL championship.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nSam Deutsch, a Cleveland jeweler and boxing promoter who also owned a minor-league baseball team, bought an NFL franchise in 1923 and named the team the Indians. They played only seven games in that first season, but they had a shot at the championship, with a 3\u20130\u20133 record going into their final game against the Canton Bulldogs, who were also undefeated. The Indians were defeated 46\u20130 and posted a 3\u20131\u20133 league record, finishing fifth in the league, which comprised twenty teams at the time.\n\nPurchase of the Canton Bulldogs\nHowever, in August 1924, Deutsch, bought the defending NFL champions Canton Bulldogs for $2,500. The Bulldogs were experiencing heavy financial troubles at time and were sold to Deutsch without much of a struggle. Duestch combined the Cleveland Indians with the Canton Bulldogs, creating a new team, the Cleveland Bulldogs. Only seven of the Canton players actually joined the new Bulldogs; among them was player-coach Guy Chamberlin. The team played all of its home games at Dunn Field although Deutsch returned the team to Canton for the Thanksgiving game that season.\n\n1924 NFL champions and controversy\nThe Cleveland Bulldogs won the NFL championship that year with a 7\u20131\u20131 record. After winning their first six games, the Bulldogs lost to the Frankford Yellow Jackets and entered a virtual tie with the Chicago Bears for first place in the standings. The Bears played more games, but also had more ties, and their one loss had come in the season opener against the Bulldogs. The Bears attempted to have an after-season exhibition game counted toward the standings, however in 1924 this was against the NFL's rules. In July 1924, NFL owners had agreed on a proposal that the 1924 NFL season would begin on September 27 and end on November 30. Ironically, as it turned out, the proposal was made by Dutch Sternaman, co-owner of the Bears. On the official end date, Cleveland had a 7\u20131\u20131 record to Bears' 6\u20131\u20134. Ties didn't count at all in those days, so the Bulldogs were in first place with an .875 winning percentage to Chicago's .857. However, on December 7, 1924 the Bulldogs went to Chicago for a challenge match. The Bears won the game, 23\u20130, and claimed that they deserved the NFL championship; they cited as precedent the 1921 championship decision (which the Bears had won over the Buffalo All-Americans) that declared there was no such thing as an exhibition game. However, the issue wasn't settled until the owners' meeting in January, when the owners voted for Cleveland to take the title. The owners also decided at that meeting that the 1925 season would run through December 20.\n\nDecline\nIn 1925, several Canton businessmen purchased the rights to the old Canton Bulldogs team from Deutsch for $3,000. The Bulldogs, now known as the Canton Bulldogs, played in Canton during the 1925 and 1926 seasons. However Deutsch continued to call his Cleveland franchise the Bulldogs. He also sold his Cleveland Indians half of the club to Herb Brandt in August 1925. That season the Cleveland Bulldogs fell to a dismal 5\u20138\u20131 record. The team performed poorly on the field and at the bank. By mid-November the organization was nearly bankrupt.\n\nIn 1926 Brandt received authority from the league to suspend operations for a year. The Bulldogs then returned in 1927, bolstered by players from the folded Kansas City Cowboys franchise. Deutsch returned as the principal owner of this new Cleveland Bulldogs club. He, along with fellow investors Max Rosenblum, Brandt, Harold Gould, and Clinton Winfrey, built the new Bulldogs around native Clevelander Benny Friedman, a star quarterback at the University of Michigan. The team finished fourth in the National Football League this season, with an 8\u20134\u20131 record.\n\nTies to the New York Giants\nAt the end of the season, Elliott Fisher purchased the Bulldogs and moved the team to Detroit, renaming them the Detroit Wolverines. The 1928 Wolverines team consisted of 12 former Bulldogs players. Before the 1929 season, Tim Mara, owner of the New York Giants, purchased the entire Wolverines squad, including Benny Friedman, and absorbed the team into his New York Giants franchise. Eight former Bulldogs players ended up playing for the Giants that season.\n\nPro Football Hall of Famers\nSeason-by-season\nExternal links\nPeterson, Robert W. (1997).

Black Swan is a 2010 American psychological horror film about a ballerina directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, and Mila Kunis. After the 83rd Academy Awards, where Portman won Best Actress for her performance in the film as a ballerina, controversy arose over how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to her and how much to her \"dance double\", American Ballet Theatre soloist Sarah Lane.In a March 3, 2011 blog post (written prior to the DVD release) for Dance Magazine, its editor-in-chief Wendy Perron asked why a visual effects video clip showing Lane's face being replaced by Portman's had been available online but was removed prior to the Oscars. She also speculated as to whether Portman's omission of Lane's name during her acceptance speech was a case of \"forgetfulness in the heat of the moment? Or was this omission, and the deletion from the video, planned by the studio's publicity machine?\" It was also noted that Lane is credited as \"Lady in the Lane\" and as \"Stunts\" rather than as Portman's double in the theatrical release of the film. This led to a number of responses regarding Portman. Aronofsky and Fox Searchlight issued a joint statement, arguing: \"We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film.\" Benjamin Millepied and Kunis also argued in defense of Portman's dancing. Lane responded through an essay published in The Wall Street Journal (Portman declined through a representative to write one as well) and an interview on 20\/20 that her interest lies primarily in defense of ballet as an art form that cannot be mastered in a year.\nThe DVD of Black Swan was released on March 29, 2011 and includes the featurette with Sarah Lane.\n\nBefore the Academy Awards\nThe film's director Darren Aronofsky stated in a July 2010 interview: \"Most of these women who are here started dancing when they were 4, 5, or 6 years old. Their bodies are shaped differently because they started so young. She was able to pull it off. Except for the wide shots when she has to be en pointe for a real long time, it's Natalie on screen. I haven't used her double a lot.\" Another time when asked whether Portman did all the dancing, he replied \"Not everything, but a lot of it. That shot, in the opening prologue when she walks off into the light and she\u2019s flapping her wings, and she\u2019s on pointe, that is 100%, untouched, no digital Natalie Portman. When the camera pulls out on her and she\u2019s on top of the ramp and she\u2019s bleeding, and she\u2019s on pointe, right before she jumps\u2014that is Natalie Portman en pointe\".In a November 29, 2010 interview, Portman's other dance double, Kimberly Prosa, also added: \"Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouett\u00e9s, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed.\" In addition, Portman said in an interview with MSN: \"I did everything, and the dance double \u2014 Sarah Lane, who's a really wonderful dancer \u2014 they shot us both doing everything, but because most of the film is in close-up, they're able to use me. The parts I couldn't do were because it's doing very complicated turns en pointe. They would shoot me doing it in flat shoes and Sarah doing it in pointe shoes and find a way to make that work.\" She also stated in a November 2010 interview with WBUR that \"there's a wonderful dancer, Sarah Lane, who did the more complicated pointe work. But I did the stuff that was possible to learn in a year.\"In December 2010, Lane also gave an interview to Kina Poon of Dance Magazine in which she responds to the question \"and how does it feel to be part of a performance that some critics are giving Natalie Portman rave reviews for?\" by saying that \"I'm not really looking for any sort of recognition. The process was a huge learning experience and I got everything I wanted out of it. But [Portman] deserves the recognition. She worked really hard.\" Lane's involvement in Black Swan was also mentioned in two other dance magazines and in an article on The New York Times website.\n\nPerron's blog\nAfter the Oscar ceremony on February 27, 2011 in which Portman won the Academy Award for Best Actress and where she thanked many people but did not mention Lane, dancer and editor-in-chief of Dance Magazine Wendy Perron published a March 3, 2011 blog post in which she asks why a visual effects video clip showing Lane's face being replaced by Portman's was once available online but later removed from the Internet prior to the Oscars. She also speculates as to whether Portman deliberately did not mention Lane, by asking if this was a case of \"forgetfulness in the heat of the moment? Or was this omission, and the deletion from the video, planned by the studio's publicity machine?\" Perron also asks, \"Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that many people believe that Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan.\"Perron followed up the next week with a second blog post on the subject. She interviewed Lane, who states that she did not expect to be named during Portman's acceptance speech because a Fox Searchlight producer had asked her to stop giving interviews until after the Oscars were over: \"They were trying to create this fa\u00e7ade that [Portman] had become a ballerina in a year and a half ... So I knew they didn't want to publicize anything about me.\" Perron then states that Lane \"says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we work so hard, but people can actually believe that it's easy enough to do it in a year. That's the thing that bothered me the most.\"\n\nAftermath\nMillepied\nBenjamin Millepied (Portman's husband and a principal dancer from New York City Ballet who debuted in Black Swan as both actor and choreographer) responded to Perron's blog in a March 23 interview with the Los Angeles Times. He states in this interview that \"there are articles now talking about her dance double [American Ballet Theatre dancer Sarah Lane] that are making it sound like [Lane] did a lot of the work, but really, she just did the footwork, and the fouett\u00e9s, and one diagonal [phrase] in the studio. Honestly, 85% of that movie is Natalie.\"\n\nLane\nLane was then asked about the subject in a March 25 interview with Entertainment Weekly to which she responded that \"of the full body shots, I would say 5 percent are Natalie ... All the other shots are me.\" In a later interview with Christopher John Farley of The Wall Street Journal, Lane states that...\n\nI did all of the dancing. Natalie and I alternated shots. They would do close-up shots with her, just of her face and kind of from her arms up. Then they would do the same shot with me, and then they would do a full body shot from far away, or a close-up of my feet, etc. And then there were a few shots they did that were closer full body shots and then they digitally put her face on my body.\nThis happened, she states, because only someone who has had years of training is able to perform in this manner. On the subject of whether she was being credited as she \"deserves\", she said, \"Definitely not\" and elaborates...\n\nIt was all my fault really because I didn't have a manager ... When I was going to sign my contract, it said on screen credit is up to the producer's discretion .... So I signed the contract and I left it. I thought they would kind of take care of me because they were really encouraging and really sweet and always saying how amazing I was. They were kind of rooting me on when I would have to do shots that were really hard and almost impossible even for a professional ballet dancer.\nHowever, she states that her response to the issue of credit is being misrepresented as it is \"kind of making me look greedy\". Instead she was actually responding to Perron's blog about the possibility of a \"cover-up\" and wanted to clarify that \"I do want people to know that you cannot absolutely become a professional ballet dancer in a year and a half no matter how hard you work. I've been doing this for 22 years.\" Lane also reiterates that she was asked by producers to stop giving interviews until after the Oscars were over and as to why she thinks that happened, explained:\n\nI had read a lot of articles that Natalie had done where she said she did 90 percent of the dancing. And never mentioned my name once. Nobody ever mentioned my name hardly ever. I'm not stupid, I got the idea that they really want to make it look like she [Portman] had accomplished something incredible.\nLane continued, \"I do want people to know that she did work really hard. And she lost a lot of weight so that if you looked at her, you would say she could pass from the arms up as a dancer. She's an amazing actor. I can't act like that. But to say that she did all of the dancing is absolutely ridiculous to anyone that knows anything about ballet.\"\n\nAronofsky and Fox Searchlight\nIn response, people involved with the film (particularly Aronofsky) and Fox Searchlight disputed Lane's claim. They released statements that stated: \"We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film.\" Aronofsky stated in an interview with Entertainment Weekly:\n\nI had my editor count shots. There are 139 dance shots in the film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two complicated longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If you look at the final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't want anyone to think that's not her they are watching. It is.\n\nKunis\nMila Kunis, Portman's co-star in the film, also gave an interview with Entertainment Weekly in which she said, \"Natalie danced her ass off\" and that \"[Portman will] tell you [that], no, she was not on pointe when she did a fouett\u00e9 [turn]. No one's going to deny that. But she did do every ounce of every one of her dances .... [Lane] wasn't used for everything. It was more like a safety net. If Nat wasn't able to do something, you'd have a safety net. The same thing that I had \u2014 I had a double as a safety net. We all did. No one ever denied it\".\n\nPerron\nIn an email exchange with Farley published on March 28 in The Wall Street Journal, Wendy Perron stated, \"the publicity department for Fox Searchlight, the studio behind the film, is just 'doing its job' in promoting Portman's work\". She also noted: \"'Natalie did most of the dancing where you see her in closeup, and she worked hard to make them convincing', Perron said via email. 'Obviously, the far shots plus the pirouettes and closeups on the feet were Sarah or another double.'\"\n\nLane and Portman further responses\nLane The Wall Street Journal essay\nOn March 30, The Wall Street Journal published an essay by Lane on the subject. (It had asked both Portman and Lane to write about these events, but Portman declined through a representative.) Lane's essay, \"My (Double) Life as A Black Swan\", describes the life of a ballet dancer and concludes by stating:\n\nI know that some people are getting very defensive about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close to the level of a professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.\n\nPortman E! interview\nIn an April 6 interview with E!, Natalie Portman responded to the question: \"What do you want to say to people who are questioning your dancing in the film?\" by stating: \"I had a chance to make something beautiful with this film and I don't want to give in to the gossip\". She also said, \"I know what went on. We had an amazing experience making the movie. I don't want to tarnish it by entering into nastiness .... I'm really proud of everyone's work on the movie and of my experience. And I'll have that forever. So it's nice for me to always know about that, no matter what kind of nastiness or gossip is going around.\" In response to a question regarding her Oscar acceptance speech, Portman responded, \"I don't remember my Oscar speech at all, and I'm actually too embarrassed to watch it.\"\n\nLane 20\/20 interview\nIn an April 15 interview with Elizabeth Vargas for ABC's 20\/20, Lane stated: \"I didn't really specify anything in my contract about getting onscreen credit or anything ... I didn't do the movie to get fame or recognition or anything.\" She added, \"I'm not speaking because I feel like I should be heralded .... I'm speaking because [the filmmakers] are completely lying about the amount of dancing Natalie did in the movie. When those incorrect things are coming out, and they threaten the entire principle of ballet, then I feel like I need to say something.\" When Vargas asked if it is possible that both interpretations of the \"math\" can be correct, Lane responded: \"It's possible, like I said, if you're counting the close-ups of her face as actual dancing shots. But I don't call close-ups of her face actual dancing.\"20\/20 also asked Black Swan editor Andy Weisblum for his take on the math. He responded that \"there are about 35 shots that are full body shots in the movie. Of those 35 shots, 12 are Natalie, and then the rest are Sarah. But over the overall film, Natalie did a lot more than that. I mean, she did most of the other shots. It was sometimes hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close.\" Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: \"He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half.\" Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: \"I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her. And she was really focused on her character every day. I definitely think she deserves all the credit that she got with the Oscar.\"\n\nDance Channel TV Network interview\nIn another interview for the Dance Channel network, Lane was asked, \"Looking back and having experienced what you had and deciding to talk about what happened, would you do Black Swan again?\" Her answer was, \"Yeah, I would.\"","label":"longbench","length":16094,"title":"Passage 1:"}

On Saturday, 9 May 2015, Al-Oruba SC were crowned the champions of the 2014\u201315 Oman Professional League with three games to spare after Sur SC was held to a 2\u20132 draw by Al-Suwaiq Club at the Al-Seeb Stadium.

It was reported that the presidents of the nine clubs (Al-Oruba, Dhofar, Al-Seeb, Al-Nahda, Fanja, Bowsher, Sohar, Al-Shabab and Sur) held a meeting in the head office of Sur SC on 7 June 2014 in order to discuss the experience of different clubs of the professional league. The statement released by the clubs after this meeting sparked a wave of controversy as all these nine clubs decided to hold a meeting with Sayyid Khalid Al-Busaidi, Chairman of the Oman Football Association and demand the cancellation of the 2014\u201315 season of the Oman Professional League. The reason given out was that the clubs were unable to meet the financial demands laid out by the association and also that the association failed to fulfill the promises made before the beginning of the pro-league system.In a major embarrassment for the Oman Football Association (OFA), all its top-division referees boycotted the three-day opening round of the prestigious Omantel Professional League (OPL), which began on 11 September 2014, over a payment issue. This was the first ever instance in Oman of OFA-accredited referees boycotting top-flight domestic league matches over a stand-off. The referees refused to officiate in the opening-round matches on 11 September 2014, 12 September 2014 and 13 September 2014 over long-standing bonus payments from the OFA. The row over pending bonus payments for the referees had been brewing since the conclusion of the inaugural edition of OPL last season. The first round match between Sur SC and Al-Seeb Club was postponed from the scheduled time to another time and the match between Dhofar S.C.S.C. and Al-Khaboora SC which was also scheduled to be held on 11 September was postponed to the next day because of the refusal of Omani referees to officiate in the league matches. The OFA, under the chairmanship of Sayyid Khalid al Busaidy, managed to defuse the crisis by requesting the UAE football body to send match officials to get the OPL started. UAE duly responded, sending 16 officials - eight referees and eight linesmen - who officiated in the seven opening-round matches that went ahead as scheduled from Thursday to Saturday at various venues in Oman.On 11 December 2014, defending champions Al-Nahda failed to turn up against Dhofar in an OPL match at the Al-Saada Stadium in Salalah; the Oman Professional League's Disciplinary Committee handed the result of the abandoned match in favour of Dhofar (3-0) and docked Al-Nahda a total of nine points - three for skipping the 11 December fixture and six more as penalty.On 11 February 2015, 4 (Al-Musannah, Al-Seeb, Bowsher and Fanja) out of the 14 clubs participating in the 2014\u201315 Oman Professional League along with 8 other Omani clubs decided to go ahead with their demand for an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) with the aim of introducing a no-confidence motion against the association's  board members.On 7 March 2015, 10 out of 39 clubs attending a consultative meeting of the OFA walked out in protest midway into the proceedings. walkout was triggered by the OFA's decision to call off an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), which was originally scheduled for 7 March 2015. However, the OFA which had previously agreed for an EGM, on 6 March 2015 shelved the summit, citing a letter from the FIFA, football's world governing body. On the very next day, the OFA cancelled the membership of 11 clubs (Ahli Sidab, Al-Ittifaq, Al-Kamel Wa Al-Wafi, Al-Musannah, Al-Seeb, Bowsher, Dhofar, Fanja, Ibri, Ja'lan and Nizwa) for illegally withdrawing from the consultative meeting conducted by the OFA.\n\nSee also\nPassage 3:\nBassel al-Assad Stadium (Homs)\nBassel al-Assad Stadium (Arabic: \u0645\u0644\u0639\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u062f) is a multi-use stadium located in the Baba Amr district in the city of Homs, Syria.

One of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, MLB comprises 30 teams, divided equally between the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), with 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. Formed in 1876 and 1901, respectively, the NL and AL cemented their cooperation with the National Agreement in 1903, making MLB the oldest major professional sports league in the world. They remained legally separate entities until 2000, when they merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball. MLB is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.Baseball's first all-professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was founded in 1869. The first few decades of professional baseball saw rivalries between leagues, and players often jumped from one team or league to another. The period before 1920 was the dead-ball era, when home runs were rarely hit. Professional baseball survived the Black Sox Scandal, a conspiracy to fix the 1919 World Series, then rose in popularity in the following decade. It survived the Great Depression and World War II. Shortly after the war, Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier.\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the AL and NL add clubs; some moved around the country. Modern stadiums with artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s. In the mid-2000s, media reports disclosed the use of anabolic steroids among MLB players; a 2006-07 investigation produced the Mitchell Report, which found that many players had used steroids and other performance-enhancing substances, including at least one player from each team.\nEach team plays 162 games per season, and six teams in each league advance to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in the World Series, a best-of-seven championship series between the two league champions first played in 1903. The New York Yankees have the most championships with 27. The defending champions are the Houston Astros, who defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2022 World Series.\nMLB is the second-wealthiest professional sport league by revenue after the National Football League (NFL). Baseball games are broadcast on television, radio, and the internet throughout North America and in several other countries. MLB has the highest total season attendance of any sports league in the world; in 2018, it drew more than 69.6 million spectators.MLB also oversees Minor League Baseball, which comprises lower-tier teams affiliated with the major league clubs. MLB and the World Baseball Softball Confederation jointly manage the international World Baseball Classic tournament.\n\nOrganizational structure\nMLB is governed by the Major League Baseball Constitution. This document has undergone several incarnations since its creation in 1876. Under the direction of the Commissioner of Baseball, MLB hires and maintains the sport's umpiring crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, and television contracts. MLB maintains a unique, controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of Minor League Baseball. This is due in large part to the 1922 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Federal Baseball Club v. National League, which held that baseball is not interstate commerce and therefore not subject to federal antitrust law; MLB is the only league that has such a status, and has not faced any competition since this case. This ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years. The weakened ruling granted more stability to the owners of teams and has resulted in values increasing at double-digit rates. There were several challenges to MLB's primacy in the sport, with notable attempts to establish competing leagues occurring during the late 1800s, from 1913 to 1915 with the short-lived Federal League, and in 1960 with the aborted Continental League.The chief executive of MLB is the commissioner, currently Rob Manfred. The deputy commissioner of baseball administration and chief legal officer is currently Dan Halem. There are seven other executives: executive vice president and general counsel, chief operations and strategy officer, chief communications officer, chief financial officer and senior advisor, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, chief revenue officer, and chief baseball development officer.The multimedia branch of MLB is MLB Advanced Media, which is based in New York City. This branch oversees MLB.com and each of the 30 teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds editorial independence from the league, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions is a similarly structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media. MLB also owns 67 percent of MLB Network, with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators and satellite provider DirecTV. It operates out of studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, and also has editorial independence from the league.\n\nLeague organization\nIn 1920, the weak National Commission, which had been created to manage relationships between the two leagues, was replaced with the much more powerful Commissioner of Baseball, who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally. From 1901 to 1960, the American and National Leagues fielded eight teams apiece.\nIn the 1960s, MLB expansion added eight teams, including the first non-U.S. team (the Montreal Expos). Two teams (the Seattle Mariners and the Toronto Blue Jays) were also added in the 1970s. From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. In 1993, the National League expanded with two teams, the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies, to even up the number of teams in both leagues. A third division, the Central Division, was formed in each league in 1994. Until 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the World Series and the All-Star Game. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997.In March 1995, two new franchises, the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now known as the Tampa Bay Rays), were awarded by MLB, which began play in 1998. This addition brought the total number of franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with five in each division), but in order for every team to be able to play daily, this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season. However, it was unclear at the time if the interleague play would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams, and therefore, one existing club would have to switch leagues. The Milwaukee Brewers agreed in November 1997 to move from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league. At the same time, the Detroit Tigers agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central (to replace Milwaukee), with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays joining the AL East. Later, when the Houston Astros changed ownership prior to the 2013 season, the team moved from the NL Central to the AL West, resulting in both leagues having three divisions of five teams each and allowing all teams to have a more balanced schedule. Interleague play is now held throughout the season.In 2000, the AL and NL were dissolved as legal entities, and MLB became a single, overall league de jure, similar to the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL)\u2014albeit with two components called \"leagues\" instead of \"conferences\". The same rules and regulations are used in both leagues, with one former exception: the AL operated under the designated hitter (DH) rule, while the NL did not. This difference in rules between leagues was unique to MLB, as the other major professional sports leagues in the U.S. and Canada have one set of rules for all teams.In 2020, the National League (NL) used the designated hitter (DH) rule for the first time. As part of the settlement of the 2021\u201322 Major League Baseball lockout, this change was made permanent thus making the rules in the two leagues identical.\n\nTeams\nAn asterisk (*) denotes a relocation of a franchise. See respective team articles for more information.\n\nHistory\nFounding\nIn the 1860s, aided by soldiers playing the game in camp during the Civil War, \"New York\"-style baseball expanded into a national game and spawned baseball's first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP). The NABBP existed as an amateur league for 12 years. By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members. Most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the Northeastern United States. For professional baseball's founding year, MLB uses the year 1869\u2014when the first professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was established.A schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati club. The NABBP split into an amateur organization and a professional organization. The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, often known as the National Association (NA), was formed in 1871. Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years. The modern Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves franchises trace their histories back to the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in the 1870s.In 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later known as the National League or NL) was established after the NA proved ineffective. The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the validity of results in doubt. The first game in the NL\u2014on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at Jefferson Street Grounds in Philadelphia)\u2014is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.\n\nThe early years of the NL were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated \"reserve clause\", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Teams came and went; 1882 was the first season where the league's membership was the same as the preceding season's, and only four franchises survived to see 1900. Competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the American Association (1882\u20131891), sometimes called the \"beer and whiskey league\" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series\u2014the first attempt at a World Series. The two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12-team NL, but the NL dropped four teams after the 1899 season. This led to the formation of the American League in 1901 under AL president Ban Johnson, and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes.The war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. A new National Association was formed to oversee these minor leagues.After 1902, the NL, AL, and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause contracts. The agreement also set up a formal classification system for minor leagues, the forerunner of today's system that was refined by Branch Rickey.\n\nOther recognized leagues\nSeveral other early defunct baseball leagues are officially considered major leagues, and their statistics and records are included with those of the two current major leagues. In 1969, the Special Baseball Records Committee of Major League Baseball officially recognized six major leagues: the National League, American League, American Association, Union Association (1884), Players' League (1890), and Federal League (1914\u20131915). The status of the National Association as a major league has been a point of dispute among baseball researchers; while its statistics are not recognized by Major League Baseball, its statistics are included with those of other major leagues by some baseball reference websites, such as Retrosheet. Some researchers, including Nate Silver, dispute the major-league status of the Union Association by pointing out that franchises came and went and that the St. Louis club was deliberately \"stacked\"; the St. Louis club was owned by the league's president and it was the only club that was close to major-league caliber. In December 2020, Major League Baseball announced its recognition of seven leagues within Negro league baseball as major leagues, and in 2021, baseball reference website Baseball-Reference.com began to include statistics from those seven leagues into their major-league statistics.\n\nDead-ball era\nThe period between 1900 and 1919 is commonly referred to as the \"dead-ball era\". Games of this era tended to be low-scoring and were often dominated by pitchers, such as Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Mordecai Brown, and Grover Cleveland Alexander. The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. The baseball used American rather than the modern Australian wool yarn and was not wound as tightly, affecting the distance that it would travel. More significantly, balls were kept in play until they were mangled, soft and sometimes lopsided. During this era, a baseball cost three dollars, equal to $50.64 today (in inflation-adjusted USD), and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Fans were expected to throw back fouls and (rare) home runs. Baseballs also became stained with tobacco juice, grass, and mud, and sometimes the juice of licorice, which some players would chew for the purpose of discoloring the ball.Also, pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the spitball. (In 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a grandfather clause.) Additionally, many ballparks had large dimensions, such as the West Side Grounds of the Chicago Cubs, which was 560 feet (170 m) to the center field fence, and the Huntington Avenue Grounds of the Boston Red Sox, which was 635 feet (194 m) to the center field fence, thus home runs were rare, and \"small ball\" tactics such as singles, bunts, stolen bases, and the hit-and-run play dominated the strategies of the time. Hitting methods like the Baltimore Chop were used to increase the number of infield singles. On a successful Baltimore chop, the batter hits the ball forcefully into the ground, causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman.The adoption of the foul strike rule in the early twentieth century quickly sent baseball from a high-scoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle. Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter. In 1901, the NL adopted the foul strike rule, and the AL followed suit in 1903.After the 1919 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds, baseball was rocked by allegations of a game fixing scheme known as the Black Sox Scandal. Eight players\u2014\"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson, Eddie Cicotte, Claude \"Lefty\" Williams, George \"Buck\" Weaver, Arnold \"Chick\" Gandil, Fred McMullin, Charles \"Swede\" Risberg, and Oscar \"Happy\" Felsch\u2014intentionally lost the World Series in exchange for a ring worth $100,000 ($1,712,780.35 in 2022 dollars). Despite being acquitted, all were permanently banned from Major League Baseball.\n\nRise in popularity\nBaseball's popularity increased in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1920 season was notable for the death of Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians. Chapman, who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury, a tragedy which led directly to both leagues requiring the placing into play new, white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty, helping bring the \"dead-ball\" era to an end. The following year, the New York Yankees made their first World Series appearance. By the end of the 1930s, the team had appeared in 11 World Series, winning eight of them. Yankees slugger Babe Ruth had set the single-season home run record in 1927, hitting 60 home runs; a few years earlier, Ruth had set the same record with 29 home runs.Affected by the difficulties of the Great Depression, baseball's popularity had begun a downward turn in the early 1930s. By 1932, only two MLB teams turned a profit. Attendance had fallen, due at least in part to a 10% federal amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices. Baseball owners cut their rosters from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts. Team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive, creating night games, broadcasting games live by radio, and rolling out promotions such as free admission for women. Throughout the period of the Great Depression, no MLB teams moved or folded.\n\nWorld War II era\nThe onset of World War II created a significant shortage of professional baseball players, as more than 500 men left MLB teams to serve in the military. Many of them played on service baseball teams that entertained military personnel in the US or in the Pacific. MLB teams of this time largely consisted of young men, older players, and those with a military classification of 4F, indicating mental, physical, or moral unsuitability for service. Men like Pete Gray, a one-armed outfielder, got the chance to advance to the major leagues. However, MLB rosters did not include any black players through the end of the war. Black players, many of whom served in the war, were still restricted to playing Negro league baseball.Wartime blackout restrictions, designed to keep outdoor lighting at low levels, caused another problem for baseball. These rules limited traveling and night games to the point that the 1942 season nearly had to be canceled. On January 14, 1942, MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis wrote a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and pleaded for the continuation of baseball during the war in hopes for a start of a new major league season. President Roosevelt responded, \"I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going. There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before. And that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before.\"With the approval of President Roosevelt, spring training began in 1942 with few repercussions. The war interrupted the careers of stars including Stan Musial, Bob Feller, Ted Williams, and Joe DiMaggio, but baseball clubs continued to field their teams.\n\nBreaking the color barrier\nBranch Rickey, president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began making efforts to introduce a black baseball player to the previously all-white professional baseball leagues in the mid-1940s. He selected Jackie Robinson from a list of promising Negro league players. After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to \"turn the other cheek\" to any racial antagonism directed at him, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month. In what was later referred to as \"The Noble Experiment\", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm club, the Montreal Royals, for the 1946 season.The following year, the Dodgers called up Robinson to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning the Negro league teams that they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspaper writers and white major league players. Manager Leo Durocher informed his team, \"I don't care if he is yellow or black or has stripes like a fucking zebra. I'm his manager and I say he plays.\"After a strike threat by some players, NL President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. Robinson received significant encouragement from several major-league players, including Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese who said, \"You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them.\" That year, Robinson won the inaugural Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (separate NL and AL Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).Less than three months later, Larry Doby became the first African-American to break the color barrier in the American League with the Cleveland Indians. The next year, a number of other black players entered the major leagues. Satchel Paige was signed by the Indians and the Dodgers added star catcher Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe, who was later the first winner of the Cy Young Award for his outstanding pitching.\n\nWomen in baseball\nMLB banned the signing of women to contracts in 1952, but that ban was lifted in 1992. There have been no female MLB players.\n\nRelocation and expansion\nFrom 1903 to 1953, the major leagues consisted of two eight-team leagues whose 16 teams were located in ten cities, all in the northeastern and midwestern United States: New York City had three teams and Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and St. Louis each had two teams. St. Louis was the southernmost and westernmost city with a major league team. The longest possible road trip, from Boston to St. Louis, took about 24 hours by railroad. After a half-century of stability, starting in the 1950s, teams began to move out of cities with multiple teams into cities that had not had them before. In three consecutive years from 1953 to 1955, three teams moved to new cities: the Boston Braves became the Milwaukee Braves, the St. Louis Browns became the Baltimore Orioles, and the Philadelphia Athletics became the Kansas City Athletics.\nThe 1958 Major League Baseball season was perhaps the pivotal season in making Major League Baseball a nationwide league. Walter O'Malley, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, moved his team to Los Angeles, marking the first major league franchise on the West Coast. Called \"perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era,\" O'Malley appeared on the cover of Time as a result of his efforts to move baseball to a more nationwide sport O'Malley was also influential in persuading the rival New York Giants to move west to become the San Francisco Giants. The Giants were already suffering from slumping attendance records at their aging ballpark, the Polo Grounds. Had the Dodgers moved out west alone, the St. Louis Cardinals\u20141,600 mi (2,575 km) away\u2014would have been the closest NL team. The joint move made West Coast road trips economical for visiting teams. O'Malley invited San Francisco Mayor George Christopher to New York to meet with Giants owner Horace Stoneham. Stoneham was considering moving the Giants to Minnesota, but he was convinced to join O'Malley on the West Coast at the end of 1957. The meetings between Stoneham, Christopher and O'Malley occurred against the wishes of Ford Frick, the Commissioner of Baseball. The dual moves were successful for both franchises\u2014and for MLB. The Dodgers set a single-game MLB attendance record in their first home appearance with 78,672 fans.In 1961, the first Washington Senators franchise moved to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to become the Minnesota Twins. Two new teams were added to the American League at the same time: the Los Angeles Angels (who soon moved from downtown L.A. to nearby Anaheim) and a new Washington Senators franchise. The NL added the Houston Astros and the New York Mets in 1962. The Astros (known as the \"Colt .45s\" during their first three seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the Louisville Colonels folded in 1899 and the first franchise to be located along the Gulf Coast. The Mets established a reputation for futility by going 40\u2013120 during their first season of play in the nation's media capital\u2014and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns\u2014but in their eighth season (1969) the Mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to play in the postseason, culminating in a World Series title over the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles.\nIn 1966, the major leagues moved to the \"Deep South\" when the Braves moved to Atlanta. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the Oakland Athletics. In 1969, the American and National Leagues both added two expansion franchises. The American League added the Seattle Pilots (who became the Milwaukee Brewers after one disastrous season in Seattle) and the Kansas City Royals. The NL added the first Canadian franchise, the Montreal Expos, as well as the San Diego Padres.\nIn 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex to become the Texas Rangers. In 1977, baseball expanded again, adding a second Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, as well as the Seattle Mariners. Subsequently, no new teams were added until the 1990s and no teams moved until 2005.\n\nPitching dominance and rule changes\nBy the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968\u2014later nicknamed \"the year of the pitcher\"\u2014Boston Red Sox player Carl Yastrzemski won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in the history of Major League Baseball. Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain won 31 games, making him the only pitcher to win 30 games in a season since Dizzy Dean in 1934. St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Bob Gibson achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12.Following these pitching performances, in December 1968 the MLB Playing Rules Committee voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees to armpits and lower the pitcher's mound from 15 to 10 inches, beginning in the 1969 season.In 1973, the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, sought to increase scoring even further by initiating the designated hitter (DH) rule.\n\nNew stadiums and artificial surfaces\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, as baseball expanded, NFL football had been surging in popularity, making it economical for many of these cities to build multi-purpose stadiums instead of single-purpose baseball fields. Because of climate and economic issues, many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from artificial turf, as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football. This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more foul territory than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.Teams began to be built around pitching\u2014particularly their bullpens\u2014and speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit ground balls \"in the hole\" between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw complete games; it was enough for a starter to pitch 6\u20137 innings and turn the game over to the team's closer, a position which grew in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals dropped. After Willie Mays hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player (George Foster) reached that mark until the 1990s.\n\nScandals and a changing game\nDuring the 1980s, baseball experienced a number of significant changes the game had not seen in years. Home runs were on the decline throughout the decade, with players hitting only 40 home runs just 13 times and no one hitting more than 50 home runs in a season for the first time since the Dead-ball era (1900\u20131919).The 1981 Major League Baseball strike from June 12 until July 31 forced the cancellation of 713 total games and resulted in a split-season format.\nIn 1985, Pete Rose broke Ty Cobb's all-time hits record with his 4,192nd hit, and in 1989 Rose received a lifetime ban from baseball as a result of betting on baseball games while manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Rose was the first person to receive a lifetime ban from baseball since 1943. 1985 also saw the Pittsburgh drug trials which involved players who were called to testify before a grand jury in Pittsburgh related to cocaine trafficking.\nThe 1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike from August 12, 1994, to April 25, 1995, caused the cancellation of over 900 games and the forfeit of the entire 1994 postseason.In 2019, Major League Baseball opened an investigation into allegations that members of the 2017 World Series champion Houston Astros stole signs from opposing teams using technology during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. The Astros were found guilty in January 2020 and while no active players faced any repercussions, Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A. J. Hinch were suspended for the entire 2020 season. The Astros were fined the maximum allowable $5 million and forfeited their first- and second-round picks in the 2020 and 2021 drafts.\n\nSteroid era, further expansion and near contraction\nRoutinely in the late 1990s and early 2000s, baseball players hit 40 or 50 home runs in a season, a feat that was considered rare even in the 1980s. It has since become apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs.\nIn 1993, the NL added the Florida Marlins in Miami and the Colorado Rockies in Denver. In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League, and two new teams were added: the NL's Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix and the AL's Tampa Bay Devil Rays in Tampa Bay.\nAfter the 2001 season, the team owners voted in favor of contraction. Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium. MLB owners agreed to hold off on reducing the league's size until at least 2006.The Montreal Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the Washington Nationals in 2005. This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to Washington after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city that had been previously abandoned. Not counting the short-lived Federal League, Montreal is the only city to host an MLB franchise since 1901 that, as of December 2022, does not currently have a team.\n\nThe modern game\nIn recent years, with the advent of technologies such as Statcast and its use of Hawk-Eye starting in 2020 as well as with advanced statistics as provided by sites such as FanGraphs and Baseball Savant, MLB has evolved. With the ability to see precise movements of pitchers and batters, teams can assess the mechanics of a player and help them improve. Statcast also provides some features such as tracking the paths of most batted balls, tracking the speed of most batted balls, and tracking the exit velocity of most batted balls. Statcast has allowed for advanced defensive analytics that have not been possible before tracking of players due to how subjective fielding can be.\nThe rate of teams using a defensive shift has gone up from 13.7% in 2016 to 33.6% in 2022 because advanced statistics support this as an effective way to stop hitters from getting hits. Because the shift reduces the amount of balls in play that result in hits and MLB wishes to increase interest in baseball, MLB announced in September 2022 that extreme infield defensive shifts would be banned starting in 2023. In order to be compliant, there must be two fielders on each side of second base, and those fielders must have both of their feet on the infield dirt at the time the pitch is thrown. If this rule is not followed, the choice of an automatic ball or the outcome of the play is given to the batting team.The game of baseball has also slowed down significantly due to an increased number of strikeouts and walks\u2014two outcomes that generally take many pitches to complete\u2014and an increased amount of time taken for a pitcher to pitch. In 2020, it took an average of three hours and six minutes to complete a 9 inning game, a number which has steadily ticked up for years. Along with the restrictions on defensive shifts, MLB announced the introduction of a pitch clock for the 2023 season and beyond, which is something that has been an experiment in MiLB for a few years. The pitch clock starts at 15 seconds. By the time the clock reaches 10 seconds, the catcher must be in their crouch behind home plate. When the clock reaches 8 seconds, the batter must be in the batter's box and be \"alert\". Before the 15 second timer reaches 0 seconds, the pitcher must have started their \"motion to pitch\". If any of these deadlines are violated, the count of the batter will be increased by one ball if the defending team violated the pitch clock or one strike if it is the offensive team who violated the pitch clock. Additionally, in order to prevent circumventing these rules pickoffs and step-offs which reset the pitch clock are only allowed two times total per plate appearance and, if a pitcher attempts a third pickoff and fails to get the runner out, a balk will be called. Similarly, a batter is restricted to calling a timeout (an action which resets the pitch clock) just once per plate appearance.\n\nUniforms\nA baseball uniform is a type of uniform worn by baseball players, and by some non-playing personnel, such as field managers and coaches. It is worn to indicate the person's role in the game and\u2014through the use of logos, colors, and numbers\u2014to identify the teams and their players, managers, and coaches.Traditionally, home uniforms display the team name on the front, while away uniforms display the team's home location. In modern times, however, exceptions to this pattern have become common, with teams using their team name on both uniforms. Most teams also have one or more alternate uniforms, usually consisting of the primary or secondary team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray. In the past few decades throwback uniforms have become popular.The New York Knickerbockers were the first baseball team to use uniforms, taking the field on April 4, 1849, in pants made of blue wool, white flannel shirts (jerseys) and straw hats. Caps and other types of headgear have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning. Baseball teams often wore full-brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule regarding headgear. Under the 1882 uniform rules, players on the same team wore uniforms of different colors and patterns that indicated which position they played. This rule was soon abandoned as impractical.In the late 1880s, Detroit and Washington of the National League and Brooklyn of the American Association were the first to wear striped uniforms. By the end of the 19th century, teams began the practice of having two different uniforms, one for when they played at home in their own baseball stadium and a different one for when they played away (on the road) at the other team's ballpark. It became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid (dark) colored vest when away. By 1900, both home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues.In June 2021, MLB announced a long-term deal with cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which includes the FTX logo appearing on umpire uniforms during all games. FTX is MLB's first-ever umpire uniform patch partner. On November 11, 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nSeason structure\nSpring training\nSpring training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season. Teams hold training camps in the states of Arizona and Florida, where the early warm weather allows teams to practice and play without worrying about the late winter cold. Spring training allows new players to compete for roster and position spots and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams that hold spring training in Arizona are grouped into the Cactus League, while teams that hold camp in Florida are known as the Grapefruit League. Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with spring break for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training.Spring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid-February and running until just before the season-opening day, traditionally the first week of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team.\n\nRegular season\nEach team plays 162 games per season. A team's schedule is typically organized into three-game series, sets of consecutive games against the same opponent, with occasional two- or four-game series. Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. All games of a series are usually hosted by the same team and multiple series are typically grouped together. I.e, a team usually hosts several series in a row, called a homestand, and follows that by going on several road series in a row. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week. Most games are scheduled at night, although teams will often play day games on Opening Day, holidays, and for the last game of a series to allow teams extra time to travel to their next opponent. Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game.\nIn the current three-division structure, each team plays 19 games against each of its four divisional opponents. It plays one home series and one away series, amounting to six or seven games, against the 10 other teams in its league. A team also plays one of the divisions in the other league, rotating each year, with two opponents in a three-game home series, two in a three-game away series, and one with four games split between home and away. Furthermore, each team has an interleague \"natural rival\" (in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area) with which it plays two home games and two away games each year.\nWith an odd number of teams in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May, all teams will participate in an interleague series. Before 2013, interleague play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates. (Before 2013, season-long interleague play was not necessary, because each league had an even number of teams. In 2013, the Houston Astros moved to the American League, so that each league would have 15 teams.) Prior to the adoption of the universal designated hitter in 2022, whether the DH was in use depended on whether the home team was from the AL, where the DH was used, or the NL, where it was not.\nStarting with the 2023 season, the scheduling formula is set to change, with each team playing at least one series against every other team every year. Each team will play 14 games against teams in the same division, with one 3-game and one 4-game series at each park, six games against teams within the same league but in other divisions, with one 3-game series at each park, and one 3-game series against teams in the other league, alternating home teams each year, except for each team's designated interleague rival, which will continue to consist of two 2-game series at each of the teams' home parks.\nBeginning with the 2022 season, teams compete for the six playoff berths in their respective leagues. To secure a berth, a team must either win its division or capture a wild card spot by having one of the three best records among the non-winners in its entire league. With the adoption of a third wild card, the former practice of breaking ties with an additional regular-season game, known as  game 163, was dropped in favor of a tie-breaker formula.\n\nAll-Star Game\nIn early-to-mid July, just after the midway point of the season, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game is held during a four-day break from the regular-season schedule. The All-Star Game features a team of players from the American League (AL)\u2014led by the manager of the previous AL World Series team\u2014and a team of players from the National League (NL), similarly managed, in an exhibition game. From 1959 to 1962, two games were held each season, one was held in July and one was held in August. The designated-hitter rule was used in the All-Star Game for the first time in 1989. Following games used a DH when the game was played in an AL ballpark. Since 2010, the DH rule has been in effect regardless of venue.The first official All-Star Game was held as part of the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois, and was the idea of Arch Ward, then sports editor for The Chicago Tribune. Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the game an annual one. Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the \"Arch Ward Trophy\", given to the All-Star Game's Most Valuable Player each year. (In 1970, it was renamed the Commissioner's Trophy, until 1985, when the name change was reversed. In 2002, it was renamed the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award.)Beginning in 1947, the eight position players in each team's starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans. The fan voting was discontinued after a 1957 ballot-box-stuffing scandal in Cincinnati: seven of the eight slots originally went to Reds players, two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for Willie Mays and Hank Aaron. Fan voting was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since, including Internet voting in recent years.The 2002 contest in Milwaukee controversially ended in an 11-inning tie when both managers ran out of pitchers. In response, starting in 2003 the league which wins the All-Star game received home-field advantage in the World Series: the league champion hosted the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two (if necessary). The National League did not win an All-Star game and thus gain a home-field advantage until 2010; it was able to overcome this disadvantage and win in three of the seven World Series from 2003 to 2009. This was discontinued after the 2016 season.MLB All-Stars from both leagues have worn uniforms from their respective teams at the game with one exception. In the 1933 All-Star Game, the National League All-Star Team members wore special gray uniforms with \"National League\" written in navy blue letters across the front of the jersey.On July 3, 2020, it was announced that the 2020 Major League Baseball All-Star Game scheduled to be held in Los Angeles would not be played due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As compensation, Los Angeles was awarded the next available All-Star Game in 2022.\n\nPostseason\nThe regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday in September), after which twelve teams enter the postseason playoffs. These twelve teams consist of the six division champions and six \"wild-card\" teams: the team with the best overall win\u2013loss record in each of the six divisions, and the three teams in each league with the best records other than the division champions. Four rounds of series of games are played to determine the champion:\nWild Card Series, a best of three games playoff between the lowest seeded division champion and three \"wild-card teams\", the higher seeds will host all three games\nAmerican League Division Series and National League Division Series, each a best-of-five-games series.\nAmerican League Championship Series and National League Championship Series, each a best-of-seven-games series played between the winning teams from the Division Series. The league champions are referred to as the pennant winners.\nWorld Series, a best-of-seven-games series played between the pennant winners of each league.Within each league, the division winners are the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 seeds, based on win\u2013loss records. The team with the best record among non-division winners will be the first wildcard and the No. 4 seed. The team with the second-best record among non-division winners will be the second wildcard and the No. 5 seed. The team with the third-best record will the third wild card and the No 6. seed  In the wildcard round, the No. 3 seed will host the No 6 seed and the No. 4 seed with host the No 5 seed with the higher team host all three games in the Wild Card Series . For the division series, the matchup will be the No. 1 seed against the  winner of the No 3 and  No 6 seed and the No. 2 seed against the winner of  No 4 and No 5 seed, unlike the NFL there will be no reseeding   Since 2017, home-field advantage in the World Series is determined by regular-season records of the two league champions, replacing a system used for the prior 14 seasons where the champion of the league that won the All-Star Game would receive home-field advantage.Because each postseason series is split between the home fields of the two teams, the home-field advantage does not usually play a large role in the postseason unless the series goes to its maximum number of games, giving one team an additional game at home. However, the first two games of a postseason series are hosted by the same team. That team may have an increased chance of starting the series with two wins, thereby gaining some momentum for the rest of the series.\n\nInternational play\nSince 1986 an All-Star team from MLB is sent to a biennial end-of-the-season tour of Japan, dubbed as MLB Japan All-Star Series, playing exhibition games in a best-of format against the All-Stars from Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) or recently as of 2014 their national team Samurai Japan.\nIn 2008, MLB played the MLB China Series in the People's Republic of China. It was a series of two spring-training games between the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. The games were an effort to popularize baseball in China.MLB played the MLB Taiwan All-Star Series in Taiwan in November 2011. It was a series of five exhibition games played by a team made up of MLB players called the MLB All-Stars and the Chinese Taipei national baseball team. The MLB All-Stars swept the series, five games to zero. At the end of the 2011 season, it was announced that the Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics would play their season openers in Japan. In October 2013, Phil Rogers of the Chicago Tribune wrote that MLB was considering postseason all-star tours in Taiwan and Korea; baseball is increasing in popularity in both countries.The Arizona Diamondbacks opened the 2014 season against Los Angeles Dodgers on March 22\u201323 in Australia. The teams played each other at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground, which has a seating capacity of 46,000. The two games represented the first MLB regular-season play held in that country. The games counted as home games for the Diamondbacks, so they played 79 home games at Chase Field.In 2019, the Red Sox were the home team in a regular-season two-game series against the Yankees. The games, which were the first regular-season MLB games held in Europe, were played on June 29\u201330 at London Stadium with the Yankees winning both games.Together with the World Baseball Softball Confederation, MLB sponsors the World Baseball Classic, an international baseball tournament contested by national teams.\n\nPerformance-enhancing drugs\nIn 1998, both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa hit more home runs than the record of 61 set by Yankees right fielder Roger Maris in 1961. Barry Bonds topped the record in 2001 with 73 home runs. McGwire, Bonds, and Sosa became the subjects of speculation regarding the use of performance-enhancing substances. McGwire later admitted that he used a steroid hormone that was still legal in baseball during the 1998 season. Baseball's original steroid testing policy, in effect from 2002 to 2005, provided for penalties ranging from a ten-game suspension for a first positive test to a one-year suspension for a fourth positive test. Players were tested at least once per year, with the chance that several players could be tested many times per year.A 2006 book, Game of Shadows by San Francisco Chronicle investigative reporters Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, chronicled alleged extensive use of performance enhancers, including several types of steroids and growth hormone by baseball superstars Barry Bonds, Gary Sheffield, and Jason Giambi. Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell was appointed by Selig on March 30, 2006 to investigate the use of performance-enhancing drugs in MLB. The appointment was made after several influential members of the U.S. Congress made negative comments about both the effectiveness and honesty of MLB's drug policies and Commissioner Selig.The day before the Mitchell Report was to be released in 2007, Selig said, \"I haven't seen the report yet, but I'm proud I did it.\" The report said that after mandatory random testing began in 2004, HGH treatment for athletic enhancement became popular among players, as HGH is not detectable in tests. It pointed out that HGH is likely a placebo with no performance-enhancing effects. The report included substance use allegations against at least one player from each MLB team.According to ESPN, some people questioned whether Mitchell's director role with the Boston Red Sox created a conflict of interest, especially because no \"prime [Sox] players were in the report.\" The report named several prominent Yankees who were parts of World Series clubs; there is a long-running and fierce Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry. Former U.S. prosecutor John M. Dowd brought up Mitchell's conflict of interest, but he later said that the former senator had done a good job. Mitchell acknowledged that his \"tight relationship with Major League Baseball left him open to criticism\", but he said that readers who examine the report closely \"will not find any evidence of bias, of special treatment of the Red Sox\".On January 10, 2013, MLB and the players union reached an agreement to add random, in-season HGH testing. They also agreed to implement a new test to reveal the use of testosterone for the 2013 season. The current MLB drug policy provides for an 80-game suspension for a first positive test, a 162-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test. In 2009, allegations surfaced against Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz, and Manny Ramirez received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for banned substances. In early April 2011, Ramirez retired from baseball rather than face a 100-game suspension for his second positive steroid test. He would later unretire, having the suspension dropped to 50 games, and would serve those in 2012.\n\nMedia coverage\nTelevision\nSeveral networks televise baseball games, including Fox, ESPN, TBS, and MLB Network. Since 2008, Fox Sports has broadcast MLB games on Fox Saturday Baseball throughout the entire season; Fox previously only broadcast games from May to September. Fox also holds rights to the All-Star Game each season. Fox also alternates League Championship Series broadcasts, broadcasting the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in odd-numbered years and the National League Championship Series (NLCS) in even-numbered years. Fox broadcasts all games of the World Series. ESPN continues to broadcast MLB games as well, beginning with national Opening Day coverage. ESPN broadcasts Sunday Night Baseball and Baseball Tonight. ESPN also has rights to the Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game each July.TBS has aired Sunday afternoon regular season games (non-exclusive) nationally, but beginning in 2022 this will be replaced by Tuesday night games. In 2007, TBS began its exclusive rights to any tiebreaker games that determine division or wild card champions. It also airs exclusive coverage of the Division Series round of the playoffs. TBS carries the League Championship Series that are not included under Fox's television agreement; TBS shows the NLCS in odd-numbered years and the ALCS in even-numbered years.In January 2009, MLB launched the MLB Network, featuring news and coverage from around the league, and airing 26 live games in the 2009 season. Each team also has local broadcasts for all games not carried by Fox on Saturdays or ESPN on Sunday nights. These games are typically split between a local broadcast television station and a local or regional sports network (RSN), though some teams only air local games through RSNs or through their own team networks. As Canada only contains one team, Sportsnet broadcasts Toronto Blue Jays games nationally. The channel is owned by Rogers Communications, who is also the parent company of the Blue Jays. Sportsnet also televises Fox's Saturday afternoon games, the All-Star Game, playoff games, and the World Series. In April 2011, TSN2 began carrying ESPN Sunday Night Baseball in Canada. TVA Sports airs Blue Jays games in French.Several MLB games are broadcast exclusively on Internet television. After a year of exclusive games on Facebook, MLB partnered with YouTube to stream weekly games on the service beginning in the 2019 season, and extending until 2022. In 2022, MLB made a deal with Apple Inc. to launch Friday Night Baseball on its Apple TV+ streaming service, and NBC Sports to broadcast MLB Sunday Leadoff, a package of early Sunday afternoon games on Peacock.\n\nBlackout policy\nMLB has several blackout rules. A local broadcaster has priority to televise games of the team in their market over national broadcasters if the game is not exclusive to the national broadcaster. A market that has a local team playing in a non-exclusive game will receive an alternative programming feed on the national broadcaster. MLB's streaming internet video service is also subject to the same blackout rules.\n\nRadio and Internet\nESPN Radio holds national broadcast rights and broadcasts Sunday Night Baseball weekly throughout the season in addition to all playoff games. The rights to the World Series are exclusive to ESPN. In 2021, TUDN Radio picked up Spanish-language rights to MLB games, starting with that year's postseason.In addition, each team employs its own announcers, who broadcast during the regular season. Most teams operate regional networks to cover their fan bases; some of these supposedly regional networks (such as the New York Yankees Radio Network) have a national reach with affiliates located across the United States. Major League Baseball has an exclusive rights deal with XM Satellite Radio, which includes the channel MLB Network Radio and live play-by-play of all games. Many teams also maintain a network of stations that broadcast their games in Spanish; as of 2022, the Los Angeles Dodgers are the only team that produces radio broadcasts in a third language, with selected games broadcast in Korean. Both Canadian teams (the Montreal Expos before their move to Washington, DC in 2005, and the Toronto Blue Jays) have produced radio broadcasts in French.MLB games are also broadcast live on the internet. All television and radio broadcasts of games are available via subscription to MLB.tv at Major League Baseball's website, MLB.com, and radio-only broadcasts are also available via subscription to MLB.com Gameday Audio. Radio station affiliates are officially forbidden from streaming games through their Internet feeds. Blackout rules are still applied for live television broadcasts, but not radio broadcasts.\n\nInternational broadcasting\nESPN Deportes televises many MLB games in Spanish throughout Latin America. Wapa 2 airs games in Puerto Rico, including spring training games and most of the World Baseball Classic games involving the team from Puerto Rico.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nNo Trees in the Street\nNo Trees in the Street is a 1959 British crime thriller directed by J. Lee Thompson and written by Ted Willis, from his 1948 stage play of the same name.The film is set in the slums of London. It depicts the life of impoverished teenager Tommy, who becomes a criminal in an attempt at social mobility. He starts with minor thefts and progresses to murder. A subplot involves the romantic involvements of Tommy's sister Hetty, first with a racketeer and then with a policeman.\nThe film is another example of British kitchen sink realism, but is mainly noted for its naturalistic depiction of slum life.\n\nPlot\nInitially, the film's story is told by Frank (Ronald Howard) a local plainclothes policeman in love with Hetty (Sylvia Syms), to a young tearaway Kenny (David Hemmings).\nIn the slums of London before World War II, Tommy (Melvyn Hayes) is an aimless teenager who tries to escape his squalid surroundings by entering a life of crime. He falls in with local racketeer Wilkie (Herbert Lom), who holds the rest of the slum citizens - including Tommy's own family - in a grip of fear.\nFor a brief period, Hetty (Tommy's older sister) becomes Wilkie's girlfriend until he humiliates her in front of the other slum citizens simply to show his power over them, after which she will have nothing to do with Wilkie despite him repeatedly asking her to come back to him.\nThe film chronicles Tommy's sordid progression from minor thefts to murder.At the end of the film, Hetty and Frank are seen to be married and living in a new council flat long after the slums have been demolished.\n\nCast\nSylvia Syms as Hetty\nHerbert Lom as Wilkie\nMelvyn Hayes as Tommy\nRonald Howard as Frank\nStanley Holloway as Kipper\nJoan Miller as Jess\nLiam Redmond as Bill\nDavid Hemmings as Kenny\nCarole Lesley as Lova\nLily Kann as Mrs Jacobson\nLloyd Lamble as Superintendent\nCampbell Singer as Inspector\nMarianne Stone as Mrs. Jokel\nRita Webb as Mrs. Brown\nLana Morris as Marje\n\nProduction\nTed Willis based his script on his 1948 play of the same name.Willis and J. Lee Thompson and Sylvia Syms had previously collaborated together on Woman in a Dressing Gown and Ice Cold in Alex.Filming began 10 March 1958. The film was revised after previews, with new scenes added at the opening, and at the end showing the detective married the sister.\n\nCritical reception\nTV Guide wrote \"NO TREES suffers from artificiality of plot and dialog. Characterizations are reduced to mere stereotypes...There are some notable exceptions within the drama, however. Syms is surprisingly moving, giving a sensitive performance despite the film's constraints. Holloway's characterization of a bookie's tout is comical and charming...The camerawork attempts a realistic documentary look, which manages to succeed in capturing the details of slum life that make the setting seem surprisingly naturalistic. The finer points of the film, however, are overshadowed by its faults.\"Time Out wrote \"released at a time when kitchen sink drama was all the rage, this is an unremarkable 'we had it tough' chronicle from another age.\"Variety wrote \"Ted Willis is a writer with a sympathetic eye for problems of the middle and lower classes...Syms gives a moving performance as the gentle girl who refuses to marry the cheap racketeer just to escape. Lom, as the opportunist who dominates the street, is sufficiently suave and unpleasant.\"\nPassage 2:\nTrue to the Navy\nTrue to the Navy is a 1930 romantic comedy film directed by Frank Tuttle for Paramount Pictures. The film stars Clara Bow as a counter girl at a San Diego drugstore with a predilection for sailors. Eventually she sets her sights on Bull's Eye McCoy (Fredric March), a stiff-necked gunner's mate.\n\nCast\nClara Bow as Ruby Nolan\nFredric March as \"Bull's-Eye\" McCoy\nHarry Green as Solomon Bimberg\nSam Hardy as Brady\nRex Bell as Eddie\nRay Cooke as Peewee\nEddie Fetherston as Michael\nEddie Dunn as Albert\nAdele Windsor as Maizie\nHarry Sweet as Artie\n\nCritical reception\nAllmovie wrote, \"the spectacle of distinguished actor Frederic March in sailor togs, chewing gum and dispensing sez-you dialogue, is worth the admission price in itself\" ; while The New York Times noted, \"it is a moderately deserting Summer-weather film, which succeeded in eliciting a good deal of laughter at its showing yesterday.\"\nPassage 3:\nAbhishek Saxena\nAbhishek Saxena is an Indian Bollywood and Punjabi film director who directed the movie Phullu.

On television, she was known for her recurring role as dressmaker Olive Woodhouse on the BBC soap opera EastEnders. She was also a notable theatre player.Syms portrayed Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in the 2006 biopic The Queen.\n\nEarly life and education\nSyms was born in Woolwich, London, England, in 1934, the daughter of Daisy (n\u00e9e Hale) and Edwin Syms, a trade unionist and civil servant.

In 1965 she appeared on stage in Dual Marriageway.\n\nLater career\nOther comedies followed, such as The Big Job (1965) with Sid James and Bat Out of Hell (1967), but it was for drama that she won acclaim, including The Tamarind Seed (1974) with Julie Andrews and Omar Sharif, for which she was nominated for a British Film Academy award. \nSyms featured in the husband-and-wife TV comedy My Good Woman from 1972 to 1974 and on the weekly BBC programme Movie Quiz as one of two team captains.\nIn 1975, Syms headed the jury at the 25th Berlin International Film Festival.In 1989, Syms guest-starred in the Doctor Who story Ghost Light.

She died there on 27 January 2023, three weeks after her 89th birthday.\n\nLegacy\nIn the words of Filmink magazine:\n\nI don\u2019t think any actress in English speaking cinema of this era had such a variety of love interests as Sylvia Syms. It helped that she was beautiful, of course...  that she could act: it\u2019s hard to think of a bad Sylvia Syms performance \u2013 sometimes she was miscast, but never bad. She always brought a level of intelligence to her roles along with a sense of fun. And she was highly adept playing \u201csmouldering hot lava of emotion and sensuality under an outwardly straight-laced and sensible facade\u201d that made her \u2013 and this is meant with nothing but the greatest respect to the recently departed \u2013 sexy as hell.\"\n\nFilmography\nSource:\n\nFilm\nTelevision\nTheatre\n1953 The Apple Cart - with No\u00ebl Coward\n1966 Peter Pan\n1984 The Vortex\n1985 Entertaining Mr Sloane - with Adam Ant\n1988 Better in My Dreams - director\n1991 Anthony and Cleopatra\n1991 The Price - director\n1992 The House of the Stairs\n1993 For Services Rendered\nPassage 7:\nG.

Lee Thompson\nJohn Lee Thompson (1 August 1914 \u2013 30 August 2002) was a British film director, active in London and Hollywood, best known for award-winning films such as Woman in a Dressing Gown, Ice Cold in Alex and The Guns of Navarone along with cult classics like Cape Fear, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and The White Buffalo.\n\nEarly life\nThompson was born in Bristol on 1 August 1914. His family had links to the theatre. Thompson studied at Dover College then went to work in the theatre, joining the Nottingham Repertory Company as an actor and stagehand. He later went to work for a repertory company in Croydon, Surrey.He wrote plays in his spare time, and had started when he was nine. One of them, Murder Happens? was performed at Croydon in 1934. His second staged play, Double Error, had a brief West End run at the Fortune Theatre in 1935. An article from this time about the play said he had written 40 plays already, including four in between his first two staged plays. A company worth \u00a310,000 was formed to exploit Thompson's writings over the next seven years but this appears to have not had a long life.Thompson later said he had written a part for himself to perform, but when management asked him if he wanted to do so he said \"of course not,\" and \"the die was cast. Later I decided if I didn't have the guts to admit I wanted to play the role I should never act again and I never did.\"\n\nScreenwriter\nThe film rights to Double Error were purchased for \u00a3100. Thompson was hired to work in the scriptwriting department at British International Pictures at Elstree Studios. While there he made his one appearance as an actor in films, playing a small role in Midshipman Easy (1935).\nHis first credit was The Price of Folly (1937), based on his play. He also worked on the scripts for Glamorous Night (1937), and he worked as dialogue coach on Jamaica Inn (1939), directed by Alfred Hitchcock.\nHe wrote the scripts for The Middle Watch (1940), made at Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) and East of Piccadilly (1941).\n\nWorld War II\nThompson served in World War II as a tailgunner and wireless operator in the RAF. In 1942 a revised version of Double Error, titled Murder Without Crime, opened at the Comedy Theatre in London. The play had a run on Broadway in 1943.\n\nPost War\nAfter the war Thompson returned to his work as scriptwriter under contract at Associated British on such films as No Place for Jennifer (1949) and For Them That Trespass (1949), the latter starring Richard Todd in his debut.\nThompson was dialogue director on The Hasty Heart (1949), which turned Todd into a star. He later said he gave up dialogue directing because he found the job \"impossible. My job was to take stars through their lines but I felt that I was also expected to be a spy for the front office. If a word was altered they wanted to know why. It was a way of keeping control.\"The same year his play The Human Touch, co written with Dudley Leslie, ran for more than a hundred performances at the Savoy Theatre in a production starring Alec Guinness.\n\nBritish film director\nEarly films\nHis first film as a director was Murder Without Crime (1950), made at ABPC, who put Thompson under contract.  Thompson was offered \u00a3500 for the screen rights to the play and \u00a3500 to direct. He said \"it was not so much that I wanted to direct movies it was to get the money so I could continue writing plays. But while directing it I got the feeling that I wanted to be a movie director.\"Thompson said \"the fact is I found directing to be much easier than writing and I enjoyed it much more than writing as well. So I became a film director.\"The film was about a man who thinks he has committed murder. Thompson also wrote the screenplay, based on his own play Double Error. In the words of Thompson's Screenonline profile \"this well structured film went largely unnoticed but contained many of the themes which were to characterise Lee Thompson's work: a good person's struggle with their conscience, an external force of evil, and an out-of-character moment of violence which has long-term consequences. Believing people can \"commit crimes without being criminals\", he sought to make his audiences condone or at least understand behaviour that they would normally condemn.\"Thompson's first film success was one he directed and co-wrote (with Anne Burnaby), The Yellow Balloon (1953), the story of a child who is blackmailed into helping a criminal after accidentally causing his friend's death.\nHe followed it with a comedy, For Better, For Worse (1954) starring Dirk Bogarde, which was even more popular though it is little remembered today.\n\nSocial Realist films\nThompson's fourth film as director The Weak and the Wicked (1954), portrays the lives of women in prison and is based on memoirs by Joan Henry, who became Thompson's second wife. Thompson wrote the script, again in collaboration with Anne Burnaby. It starred Glynis Johns and Diana Dors and was a hit at the box office. The success of the film greatly added to Thompson's prestige and he began to be regarded as one of the leading directors in the country.Thompson was loaned to Rank Films to direct a Jack Buchanan comedy, As Long as They're Happy (1955), co-starring Dors and An Alligator Named Daisy (1955), also starring Dors, along with Donald Sinden. He returned to ABPC and the theme of female prisoners in Yield to the Night (1956), an anti-capital punishment tale with Diana Dors as the condemned prisoner.\nThompson later said the \"pattern\" of his ABPC films was \"two pieces of tepid rubbish for one decent project - if I could persuade Robert Clark, who was head of production. He used to wring his hands when I insisted. 'Okay,' he'd finally say. 'Do it if you must. But it won't make money.' I admired him for that really. He did give you a bit of a chance.\"The Good Companions (1957) was lighter fare, based on a book by J. B. Priestley. According to one obituary Thompson \"made excellent use of the CinemaScope screen, assembled a fine supporting cast and, with zestful choreography... came up with one of the few successes in a genre for which the British cinema was not noted.\"Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957), with Yvonne Mitchell, Anthony Quayle and Sylvia Syms and written by Ted Willis, deals with the collapse of a 20-year marriage.\n\nAction director\nThompson had a big success with Ice Cold in Alex (1958), the story of a British Army unit trekking across North Africa in the Second World War. It featured John Mills, Sylvia Syms, Anthony Quayle and Harry Andrews. It won three BAFTA Awards, including Best British Film. He followed it with North West Frontier (1959), an adventure film set in British India starring Kenneth More and Lauren Bacall. It was one of the most popular films in Britain in 1959.No Trees in the Street (1959) was a thriller written by Willis. Also in that genre was Tiger Bay (1959), starring John Mills. It introduced cinema audiences to Mills' daughter Hayley and German actor Horst Buchholz.  Hayley Mills also earned a BAFTA for Most Promising Newcomer portraying a 12-year-old girl who refuses to betray a sailor accused of murder.\nThompson followed this with I Aim at the Stars (1960).\n\nHollywood career\nGuns of Navarone and Cape Fear\nThompson vaulted to international fame with The Guns of Navarone (1961) as a last-minute replacement for director Alexander Mackendrick. His take-charge attitude during its production earned him the nickname 'Mighty Mouse' from lead actor Gregory Peck. Co-star Anthony Quinn said Thompson:\n\nNever read a scene until he had to shoot it and approached each shot on a whim. And yet the cumulative effect was astonishing. Lee Thompson made a marvelous picture but how? Perhaps his inventiveness lay in defying convention, in rejecting the accepted methods of motion picture making and establishing his own. Perhaps it was in his very formlessness that he found the one form he could sustain, and nurture, the one form that could, in turn, sustain and nurture him. Perhaps he was just a lucky Englishman who pulled a good picture out of his ass.\nThe Guns of Navarone, a World War II epic filmed on location in Rhodes, Greece, was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Thompson for Best Director. In 1961 he said \"primarily I am in the business to entertain. This does not mean that I never want to try artistic movies again. But I do not think you can sell art on the big movie circuits. Art belongs in the art houses.\" Later he said \"I liked the character bits best\" about Navarone. \"Anyone can make an explosion.\"The success of Navarone won him entry into Hollywood, where he directed Cape Fear (1962), a psychological thriller with Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Polly Bergen and Lori Martin; Peck and Mitchum co-producing the film. Based on a novel called The Executioners by John D. MacDonald, Cape Fear shows how a sex offender can manipulate the justice system and terrorise an entire family. Highly controversial for its time, the film was cut heavily in both the United States and the United Kingdom.\nHe worked on a project with Warren Beatty and Clifford Odets based on an idea of Beatty's. It was never made. Neither was The Short Cut which he discussed doing with Darryl F. Zanuck, or The Living Room from a novel by Graham Greene or Chips with Everything by Arnold Wesker.\n\nMirisch Brothers\nThompson directed Yul Brynner in the Cossack epic Taras Bulba (1962) for producer Harold Hecht. Thompson was going to follow it with Big Charlie starring Brynner but the movie was not made. In 1962 the Mirisch Brothers signed the director to a four-picture contract. The first film made under this contract was the Mayan Indian epic Kings of the Sun (1963), starring Brynner.\nIn September 1962 Thompson said he would make I Love Louisa with Elizabeth Taylor produced by Arthur Jacobs. (This film became What a Way to Go!(1964) with Shirley MacLaine.) He would put actors under personal contract like Talitha Pol.In September 1963 Thompson announced he had formed a company, Bowhall Productions, to make around four films a year in the $120,000-$160,000 budget range. Thompson said it was \"unlikely\" the films would \"make a profit\" but they were movies he \"deeply wanted to make\". They included Chips with Everything, Rose without a Thorn by Clifford Bax, and a film in Spain. Following Return from the Ashes he would also make a $7 million movie in Africa Thunder of Giants.Instead he did another with MacLaine, John Goldfarb, Please Come Home (1965). Back in England Thompson made Return from the Ashes (1965) for the Mirisch Brothers. In April 1965 Thompson announced he would make High Citadel based on a novel by Desmond Bagley for the Mirisch Brothers. These plans were postponed when Thompson received an offer to replace Michael Anderson, who had fallen ill before he was to start directing a thriller about cults with David Niven, Eye of the Devil (1967) (originally titled 13). High Citadel was never filmed. Another film announced but never filmed was The Case Against Colonel Sutton which he was going to do with producer Martin Poll. Neither was a proposed musical remake of The Private Lives of Henry VIII.After a war film, Before Winter Comes (1968) Thompson was reunited with the star, producer and writer of Navarone in the Western Mackenna's Gold (1969) but it did poorly at the box office. So too did the espionage tale The Chairman (1969) with Gregory Peck. He was meant to follow that with You?, about assassination from a script by Andrew Sinclair. It was never filmed. \"I freely admit I've done some pretty bad stuff,\" he said in 1968. \"It's entirely my own fault. The trouble was I accepted some dismal scripts.  I wasn't tough enough... Writing is the fundamental thing.\" Some have argued that Thompson's creative decline coincided with the end of his relationship with Henry.\n\nApes Movies\nBack in the UK he directed Country Dance, also known as Brotherly Love (1970). Thompson's handling of a smaller scale film impressed producer Arthur Jacobs, with whom Thompson had made What a Way to Go; Thompson was the first director attached to the Jacobs production The Planet of the Apes and Thompson says he turned down the first two sequels. He was available to make the fourth and fifth movies in the series, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Writer Paul Dehn said Thompson had a reputation as someone with a drinking problem but that he had overcome it by the time of the Apes films.\"They were cutting back on the budgets the whole time after the first one\", said Thompson later. \"It was a bad policy.\"\n\nLater career\nUS Television\nThompson began working more in US television, directing the television films A Great American Tragedy (1972), Huckleberry Finn (1974) starring Jeff East and Paul Winfield, The Reincarnation of Peter Proud (1974) and Widow (1976) as well as the pilot episode of The Blue Knight (1975).\nHe returned to playwriting with Getting Away with Murder (1976).\n\nCharles Bronson\nIn 1976, Thompson began a long collaboration with actor Charles Bronson on the Warner Bros. crime story St. Ives . John Crowther, who worked with both men, later said \"Thompson was the total antithesis of Charlie and they got along famously. They really worked well together.\u201dIn 1977, Bronson and Thompson teamed again on an unconventional western film called The White Buffalo.Thompson directed two films starring Anthony Quinn, The Greek Tycoon and The Passage. Reviewing the latter The Guardian called Thompson a director who \"should know better but often doesn't\". The Globe and Mail argued Thompson was \"possibly the worst experienced director working in the world today.\"Thompson directed the horror film, Happy Birthday to Me in 1980.\nIn 1981 Thompson and Bronson made the film Caboblanco, which opened on Los Angeles on 24 April. Also that year he directed an episode of the TV show Code Red, and which he followed with another Bronson movie, 10 to Midnight.Thompson worked with Bronson again on, The Evil That Men Do (1984), which was shot in Mexico.  Thompson was hired to replace original director Fielder Cook, who was fired shortly before filming began. Producer Pancho Okhenr said Thompson \"knew exactly what shots he needed to put together the film...  [Bronson] had a lot of respect for Lee. The whole crew appreciated when the director did not make them work over and over to get the same shot from different angles... He was just a terrific filmmaker.\u201dAlso released that year was The Ambassador, starring Robert Mitchum.\nOn 22 November 1985, King Solomon's Mines premiered. Thompson made this film as an Indiana Jones-style pastiche. It was shot in Zimbabwe and starred Richard Chamberlain. The film was reasonably successful at the box office.\nOn 18 April 1986, Murphy's Law, the Thompson and Bronson collaboration of that year, started its theatrical run. It is a neo-noir thriller film. Acting in the film are Kathleen Wilhoite, Carrie Snodgress, Robert F. Lyons, and Richard Romanus. Thompson tried another Indiana Jones-type tale with Firewalker, which premiered on 21 November. The film paired the actors Chuck Norris with Louis Gossett Jr. as its leads. The action adventure co-stars Will Sampson and Melody Anderson. Norris and Gossett play Max Donigan and Leo Porter, two soldiers of fortune, whose adventures rarely result in any notable gain. They are befriended by an inscrutable woman of mystery Patricia (Anderson). Patricia's map leads them on a quest for treasure in Central America. The name of the movie comes from the powerful guardian of the treasure.\nNow working exclusively for Cannon, Thompson made two more Charles Bronson thrillers. On 6 November 1987 Death Wish 4: The Crackdown was released and 16 September 1988 saw the opening of Messenger of Death. He later reflected, \"I realized these films were not going to enhance my reputation. I had to live with that. You're not going to be offered the great films at a certain age.\"3 February 1989, Thompson's final directorial effort was released Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects starring Charles Bronson.In 1990 Thompson moved to Sooke.In 1992 Thompson said he was trying to finance a remake of Tiger Bay with Anna Chumsky and Alec Baldwin. The director said \"I have certain regrets now. I would rather have stuck to making films like Yield to the Night which had some integrity and importance. But the British film industry caved in. I shouldn't denigrate myself too much because I have enjoyed making my films but I suppose I sort of sold out.\"\n\nPersonal life\nThompson was married three times. His first wife was Florence Bailey, whom he married in 1935 when he was 20. They had a son, Peter (1938\u20131997), who became a film editor on several of his father's films and predeceased him, and a daughter, Lesley, who survived him. They divorced in 1957.\nHis second wife was prisoner and author Joan Henry, whom he married in 1958. They collaborated on Weak and the Wicked and Yield to the Night. He left her for actress Susan Hampshire. In March 1962 Hedda Hopper reported that Thompson was \"sweating it out\" in Los Angeles while Henry and Hampshire were \"awaiting his decision in London.\" Thompson confirmed this in an interview, and Hampshire and Henry were less forthcoming to the press.In September, Hopper reported that it was over between Thompson and Hampshire. Henry and Thompson were divorced in the late 1960s.In November 1962, Thompson said he had proposed to Shirley Ann Field whom he said accepted then changed her mind.His third wife was Penny, who was his widow.\n\nDeath\nThompson died of congestive heart failure on 30 August 2002, at his holiday home in Sooke, British Columbia, aged 88.\n\nCritical appraisal\nThe Guardian obituary called him \"a compelling craftsman\". The Washington Post said \"he directed adventure films noted for their punchy pacing, rich atmosphere and nuanced characterization.\" Variety said he was \"Known as a craftsman who had a clear sense of how each film should play, scene by scene\".The Independent said \"he lent his acute sense of atmosphere and vivid visual style to a wide range of material. His intimate kitchen-sink melodramas... were unflinching portraits of social realism unusually stark for their time. His thrillers were tautly edited exercises in suspense, and he also made some engaging comedies and a bracing musical...Though his later films can most kindly be labelled potboilers, his body of work in the Fifties and early Sixties was an impressive one.\"In 2000 he stated that he made so many American films \"because of my insecurity and effort to stay here. If I was given a script and it had something good in it I'd say, 'Good, I've got my next picture!' That is not the way to make good films, so some of them were good and some not so good.... What an idiot! 'You should have stayed at what you really wanted to make.' If I have anything to say to young directors today it's don't make a film for the sake of making it. Make it only if you really believe in it. Then success will eventually come to you.\"\n\nAwards\nNominated, Best Director Academy Award, The Guns of Navarone (1961)\nNominated, Best Director Directors Guild of America, The Guns of Navarone (1961)\nNominated, Best Director Golden Globe, The Guns of Navarone (1961)\nWinner, Best Film Golden Globe, The Guns of Navarone (1961)\nNominated, Best Film BAFTA, Tiger Bay (1959)\nNominated, Best Film BAFTA, North West Frontier (1959)\nNominated, Golden Bear Berlin International Film Festival, Tiger Bay (1959)\nWinner, FIPRESCI Prize Berlin International Film Festival, Ice Cold in Alex (1958)\nNominated, Golden Bear Berlin International Film Festival, Ice Cold in Alex (1958)\nWinner, Special Mention Berlin International Film Festival, Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957)\nWinner, FIPRESCI Prize Berlin International Film Festival, Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957)\nNominated, Golden Bear Berlin International Film Festival, Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957)\nNominated, Palme d'Or Cannes Film Festival, Yield to the Night (1956)\n\nSelected filmography\nScreenwriter\nThe Price of Folly (1937)\nThe Middle Watch (1940)\nLast Holiday 1950 film: additional dialogue contributions to J B Priestley's Script.\n\nDirector\n1950s\nMurder Without Crime (1950)\nThe Yellow Balloon (1953)\nFor Better, for Worse (1954)\nThe Weak and the Wicked (1954)\nAs Long as They're Happy (1955)\nAn Alligator Named Daisy (1955)\nYield to the Night (1956)\nThe Good Companions (1957)\nWoman in a Dressing Gown (1957)\nIce Cold in Alex (1958)\nNorth West Frontier (1959)\nNo Trees in the Street (1959)\nTiger Bay (1959)\n\n1960s\nI Aim at the Stars (1960)\nThe Guns of Navarone (1961)\nCape Fear (1962)\nTaras Bulba (1962)\nKings of the Sun (1963)\nWhat a Way to Go!

{"context":"Introduction\nThere exists a class of language construction known as pun in natural language texts and utterances, where a certain word or other lexical items are used to exploit two or more separate meanings. It has been shown that understanding of puns is an important research question with various real-world applications, such as human-computer interaction BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 and machine translation BIBREF2 . Recently, many researchers show their interests in studying puns, like detecting pun sentences BIBREF3 , locating puns in the text BIBREF4 , interpreting pun sentences BIBREF5 and generating sentences containing puns BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 . A pun is a wordplay in which a certain word suggests two or more meanings by exploiting polysemy, homonymy, or phonological similarity to another sign, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. Puns can be generally categorized into two groups, namely heterographic puns (where the pun and its latent target are phonologically similar) and homographic puns (where the two meanings of the pun reflect its two distinct senses) BIBREF9 . Consider the following two examples:\nThe first punning joke exploits the sound similarity between the word \u201cpropane\" and the latent target \u201cprofane\", which can be categorized into the group of heterographic puns. Another categorization of English puns is homographic pun, exemplified by the second instance leveraging distinct senses of the word \u201cgut\".\nPun detection is the task of detecting whether there is a pun residing in the given text. The goal of pun location is to find the exact word appearing in the text that implies more than one meanings. Most previous work addresses such two tasks separately and develop separate systems BIBREF10 , BIBREF5 . Typically, a system for pun detection is built to make a binary prediction on whether a sentence contains a pun or not, where all instances (with or without puns) are taken into account during training. For the task of pun location, a separate system is used to make a single prediction as to which word in the given sentence in the text that trigger more than one semantic interpretations of the text, where the training data involves only sentences that contain a pun. Therefore, if one is interested in solving both problems at the same time, a pipeline approach that performs pun detection followed by pun location can be used.\nCompared to the pipeline methods, joint learning has been shown effective BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 since it is able to reduce error propagation and allows information exchange between tasks which is potentially beneficial to all the tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that the detection and location of puns can be jointly addressed by a single model. The pun detection and location tasks can be combined as a sequence labeling problem, which allows us to jointly detect and locate a pun in a sentence by assigning each word a tag. Since each context contains a maximum of one pun BIBREF9 , we design a novel tagging scheme to capture this structural constraint. Statistics on the corpora also show that a pun tends to appear in the second half of a context. To capture such a structural property, we also incorporate word position knowledge into our structured prediction model. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that detection and location tasks can reinforce each other, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on these two tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs joint detection and location of English puns by using a sequence labeling approach.\nProblem Definition\nWe first design a simple tagging scheme consisting of two tags { INLINEFORM0 }:\nINLINEFORM0 tag means the current word is not a pun.\nINLINEFORM0 tag means the current word is a pun.\nIf the tag sequence of a sentence contains a INLINEFORM0 tag, then the text contains a pun and the word corresponding to INLINEFORM1 is the pun.\nThe contexts have the characteristic that each context contains a maximum of one pun BIBREF9 . In other words, there exists only one pun if the given sentence is detected as the one containing a pun. Otherwise, there is no pun residing in the text. To capture this interesting property, we propose a new tagging scheme consisting of three tags, namely { INLINEFORM0 }.\nINLINEFORM0 tag indicates that the current word appears before the pun in the given context.\nINLINEFORM0 tag highlights the current word is a pun.\nINLINEFORM0 tag indicates that the current word appears after the pun.\nWe empirically show that the INLINEFORM0 scheme can guarantee the context property that there exists a maximum of one pun residing in the text.\nGiven a context from the training set, we will be able to generate its corresponding gold tag sequence using a deterministic procedure. Under the two schemes, if a sentence does not contain any puns, all words will be tagged with INLINEFORM0 or INLINEFORM1 , respectively. Exemplified by the second sentence \u201cSome diets cause a gut reaction,\" the pun is given as \u201cgut.\" Thus, under the INLINEFORM2 scheme, it should be tagged with INLINEFORM3 , while the words before it are assigned with the tag INLINEFORM4 and words after it are with INLINEFORM5 , as illustrated in Figure FIGREF8 . Likewise, the INLINEFORM6 scheme tags the word \u201cgut\" with INLINEFORM7 , while other words are tagged with INLINEFORM8 . Therefore, we can combine the pun detection and location tasks into one problem which can be solved by the sequence labeling approach.\nModel\nNeural models have shown their effectiveness on sequence labeling tasks BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . In this work, we adopt the bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) BIBREF16 networks on top of the Conditional Random Fields BIBREF17 (CRF) architecture to make labeling decisions, which is one of the classical models for sequence labeling. Our model architecture is illustrated in Figure FIGREF8 with a running example. Given a context\/sentence INLINEFORM0 where INLINEFORM1 is the length of the context, we generate the corresponding tag sequence INLINEFORM2 based on our designed tagging schemes and the original annotations for pun detection and location provided by the corpora. Our model is then trained on pairs of INLINEFORM3 .\nInput. The contexts in the pun corpus hold the property that each pun contains exactly one content word, which can be either a noun, a verb, an adjective, or an adverb. To capture this characteristic, we consider lexical features at the character level. Similar to the work of BIBREF15 , the character embeddings are trained by the character-level LSTM networks on the unannotated input sequences. Nonlinear transformations are then applied to the character embeddings by highway networks BIBREF18 , which map the character-level features into different semantic spaces.\nWe also observe that a pun tends to appear at the end of a sentence. Specifically, based on the statistics, we found that sentences with a pun that locate at the second half of the text account for around 88% and 92% in homographic and heterographic datasets, respectively. We thus introduce a binary feature that indicates if a word is located at the first or the second half of an input sentence to capture such positional information. A binary indicator can be mapped to a vector representation using a randomly initialized embedding table BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 . In this work, we directly adopt the value of the binary indicator as part of the input.\nThe concatenation of the transformed character embeddings, the pre-trained word embeddings BIBREF21 , and the position indicators are taken as input of our model.\nTagging. The input is then fed into a BiLSTM network, which will be able to capture contextual information. For a training instance INLINEFORM0 , we suppose the output by the word-level BiLSTM is INLINEFORM1 . The CRF layer is adopted to capture label dependencies and make final tagging decisions at each position, which has been included in many state-of-the-art sequence labeling models BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . The conditional probability is defined as:\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is a set of all possible label sequences consisting of tags from INLINEFORM1 (or INLINEFORM2 ), INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 are weight and bias parameters corresponding to the label pair INLINEFORM5 . During training, we minimize the negative log-likelihood summed over all training instances:\nwhere INLINEFORM0 refers to the INLINEFORM1 -th instance in the training set. During testing, we aim to find the optimal label sequence for a new input INLINEFORM2 :\nThis search process can be done efficiently using the Viterbi algorithm.\nDatasets and Settings\nWe evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets BIBREF9 . The homographic dataset contains 2,250 contexts, 1,607 of which contain a pun. The heterographic dataset consists of 1,780 contexts with 1,271 containing a pun. We notice there is no standard splitting information provided for both datasets. Thus we apply 10-fold cross validation. To make direct comparisons with prior studies, following BIBREF4 , we accumulated the predictions for all ten folds and calculate the scores in the end.\nFor each fold, we randomly select 10% of the instances from the training set for development. Word embeddings are initialized with the 100-dimensional Glove BIBREF21 . The dimension of character embeddings is 30 and they are randomly initialized, which can be fine tuned during training. The pre-trained word embeddings are not updated during training. The dimensions of hidden vectors for both char-level and word-level LSTM units are set to 300. We adopt stochastic gradient descent (SGD) BIBREF26 with a learning rate of 0.015.\nFor the pun detection task, if the predicted tag sequence contains at least one INLINEFORM0 tag, we regard the output (i.e., the prediction of our pun detection model) for this task as true, otherwise false. For the pun location task, a predicted pun is regarded as correct if and only if it is labeled as the gold pun in the dataset. As to pun location, to make fair comparisons with prior studies, we only consider the instances that are labeled as the ones containing a pun. We report precision, recall and INLINEFORM1 score in Table TABREF11 . A list of prior works that did not employ joint learning are also shown in the first block of Table TABREF11 .\nResults\nWe also implemented a baseline model based on conditional random fields (CRF), where features like POS tags produced by the Stanford POS tagger BIBREF27 , n-grams, label transitions, word suffixes and relative position to the end of the text are considered. We can see that our model with the INLINEFORM0 tagging scheme yields new state-of-the-art INLINEFORM1 scores on pun detection and competitive results on pun location, compared to baselines that do not adopt joint learning in the first block. For location on heterographic puns, our model's performance is slightly lower than the system of BIBREF25 , which is a rule-based locator. Compared to CRF, we can see that our model, either with the INLINEFORM2 or the INLINEFORM3 scheme, yields significantly higher recall on both detection and location tasks, while the precisions are relatively close. This demonstrates the effectiveness of BiLSTM, which learns the contextual features of given texts \u2013 such information appears to be helpful in recalling more puns.\nCompared to the INLINEFORM0 scheme, the INLINEFORM1 tagging scheme is able to yield better performance on these two tasks. After studying outputs from these two approaches, we found that one leading source of error for the INLINEFORM2 approach is that there exist more than one words in a single instance that are assigned with the INLINEFORM3 tag. However, according to the description of pun in BIBREF9 , each context contains a maximum of one pun. Thus, such a useful structural constraint is not well captured by the simple approach based on the INLINEFORM4 tagging scheme. On the other hand, by applying the INLINEFORM5 tagging scheme, such a constraint is properly captured in the model. As a result, the results for such a approach are significantly better than the approach based on the INLINEFORM6 tagging scheme, as we can observe from the table. Under the same experimental setup, we also attempted to exclude word position features. Results are given by INLINEFORM7 - INLINEFORM8 . It is expected that the performance of pun location drops, since such position features are able to capture the interesting property that a pun tends to appear in the second half of a sentence. While such knowledge is helpful for the location task, interestingly, a model without position knowledge yields improved performance on the pun detection task. One possible reason is that detecting whether a sentence contains a pun is not concerned with such word position information.\nAdditionally, we conduct experiments over sentences containing a pun only, namely 1,607 and 1,271 instances from homographic and heterographic pun corpora separately. It can be regarded as a \u201cpipeline\u201d method where the classifier for pun detection is regarded as perfect. Following the prior work of BIBREF4 , we apply 10-fold cross validation. Since we are given that all input sentences contain a pun, we only report accumulated results on pun location, denoted as Pipeline in Table TABREF11 . Compared with our approaches, the performance of such an approach drops significantly. On the other hand, such a fact demonstrates that the two task, detection and location of puns, can reinforce each other. These figures demonstrate the effectiveness of our sequence labeling method to detect and locate English puns in a joint manner.\nError Analysis\nWe studied the outputs from our system and make some error analysis. We found the errors can be broadly categorized into several types, and we elaborate them here. 1) Low word coverage: since the corpora are relatively small, there exist many unseen words in the test set. Learning the representations of such unseen words is challenging, which affects the model's performance. Such errors contribute around 40% of the total errors made by our system. 2) Detection errors: we found many errors are due to the model's inability to make correct pun detection. Such inability harms both pun detection and pun location. Although our approach based on the INLINEFORM0 tagging scheme yields relatively higher scores on the detection task, we still found that 40% of the incorrectly predicted instances fall into this group. 3) Short sentences: we found it was challenging for our model to make correct predictions when the given text is short. Consider the example \u201cSuperglue! Tom rejoined,\" here the word rejoined is the corresponding pun. However, it would be challenging to figure out the pun with such limited contextual information.\nRelated Work\nMost existing systems address pun detection and location separately. BIBREF22 applied word sense knowledge to conduct pun detection. BIBREF24 trained a bidirectional RNN classifier for detecting homographic puns. Next, a knowledge-based approach is adopted to find the exact pun. Such a system is not applicable to heterographic puns. BIBREF28 applied Google n-gram and word2vec to make decisions. The phonetic distance via the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary is computed to detect heterographic puns. BIBREF10 used the hidden Markov model and a cyclic dependency network with rich features to detect and locate puns. BIBREF23 used a supervised approach to pun detection and a weakly supervised approach to pun location based on the position within the context and part of speech features. BIBREF25 proposed a rule-based system for pun location that scores candidate words according to eleven simple heuristics. Two systems are developed to conduct detection and location separately in the system known as UWAV BIBREF3 . The pun detector combines predictions from three classifiers. The pun locator considers word2vec similarity between every pair of words in the context and position to pinpoint the pun. The state-of-the-art system for homographic pun location is a neural method BIBREF4 , where the word senses are incorporated into a bidirectional LSTM model. This method only supports the pun location task on homographic puns. Another line of research efforts related to this work is sequence labeling, such as POS tagging, chunking, word segmentation and NER. The neural methods have shown their effectiveness in this task, such as BiLSTM-CNN BIBREF13 , GRNN BIBREF29 , LSTM-CRF BIBREF30 , LSTM-CNN-CRF BIBREF14 , LM-LSTM-CRF BIBREF15 .\nIn this work, we combine pun detection and location tasks as a single sequence labeling problem. Inspired by the work of BIBREF15 , we also adopt a LSTM-CRF with character embeddings to make labeling decisions.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose to perform pun detection and location tasks in a joint manner from a sequence labeling perspective. We observe that each text in our corpora contains a maximum of one pun. Hence, we design a novel tagging scheme to incorporate such a constraint. Such a scheme guarantees that there is a maximum of one word that will be tagged as a pun during the testing phase. We also found the interesting structural property such as the fact that most puns tend to appear at the second half of the sentences can be helpful for such a task, but was not explored in previous works. Furthermore, unlike many previous approaches, our approach, though simple, is generally applicable to both heterographic and homographic puns. Empirical results on the benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach that the two tasks of pun detection and location can be addressed by a single model from a sequence labeling perspective.\nFuture research includes the investigations on how to make use of richer semantic and linguistic information for detection and location of puns. Research on puns for other languages such as Chinese is still under-explored, which could also be an interesting direction for our future studies.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive comments.

In the strong coupling regime of lattice QCD with staggered quarks, the dual formulation is suitable to address the nuclear liquid gas transition.\nWe determine this first order transition at low temperatures and as a function of the quark mass and the inverse gauge coupling \u03b2. We also determine the baryon mass and discuss the nuclear interactions as a function of the quark mass, and compare to mean field results. It is known from experiments that at low temperatures, there is a phase transition between dilute hadron gas and dense nuclear matter as the baryon chemical potential increases.\nThis transition is of first order and terminates at about T c = 16 MeV in a critical end point. The value of the chemical potential \u00b5 1st B at zero temperature is given roughly by the baryon mass m B , where the difference of \u00b5 1st B \u2212m B is due to nuclear interactions. For a review on nuclear interactions see .\nAs the nuclear force between baryons to form nuclear matter is due to the residual strong interactions between quarks and gluons, it should be accurately described by QCD. We choose to study the nuclear transition and nuclear interaction via lattice QCD , with its Lagrangian being a function of the quark mass and the inverse gauge coupling.\nIn order to understand the nature of the transition, it is helpful to study its dependence on these parameters. However, at finite baryon density, lattice QCD has the infamous sign problem which does not allow us to perform direct Monte Carlo simulations on the lattice. Various methods have been proposed to overcome the numerical sign problem, but they are either limited to \u00b5 B \/T 3 or can not yet address full QCD in 3+1 dimensions in the whole \u00b5 B \u2212 T plane , in particular the nuclear transition is out of reach.\nAn alternative method is to study lattice QCD via the strong coupling expansion. There are two established effective theories for lattice QCD based on this: (1) the 3-dim. effective theory for Wilson fermions in terms of Polyakov loops, arising from a joint strong coupling and hopping parameter expansion , the dual representation for staggered fermions in 3+1 dimensions, with dual degrees of freedom describing mesons and baryons.\nBoth effective theories have their limitations: is limited to rather heavy quarks (but is valid for large values of \u03b2) whereas ( ) is limited to the strong coupling regime \u03b2 1 (but is valid for any quark mass). We study lattice QCD in the dual formulation, both at infinite bare gauge coupling, \u03b2 = 0, and at leading order of the strong coupling expansion in the regime \u03b2 < 1, which is far from the continuum limit.\nBut since strong coupling lattice QCD shares important features with QCD, such as confinement, and chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at the chiral transition temperature, and a nuclear liquid gas transition, we may get insights into the mechanisms, in particular as the dual variables give more information in terms of its world lines, as compared to the usual fermion determinant that depends on the gauge variables.\nTo establish a region of overlap of both effective theories, we have chosen to perform the Monte Carlo simulations in the dual formulation extending to rather large quark masses. This paper is organized as follows: in the first part we explain the dual formulation in the strong coupling regime, in the second part we provide analytic results based on exact enumeration and mean field theory, in the third part we explain the setup of our Monte Carlo simulations and present result on the m q -and \u03b2-dependence of the nuclear transition.\nSince the strong coupling regime does not have a well defined lattice spacing, we also determine the baryon mass am B to set the parameters of the grand-canonical partition function, aT and a\u00b5 B , in units of am B . We conclude by discussing the resulting nuclear interactions, and compare our findings with other results.\n\nStaggered action of strong coupling QCD and its dual representation\n\nIn the strong coupling regime, the gauge integration is performed first, followed by the Grassmann integration to obtain a dual formulation. This was pioneered for the strong coupling limit in and has been extended by one of us to include gauge corrections . The sign problem is mild in the strong coupling limit and still under control for \u03b2 < 1, where we can apply sign reweighting.\nThe dual degrees of freedom are color-singlet mesons and baryons, which are point-like in the strong coupling limit, and become extended about a lattice spacing by incorporating leading order gauge corrections. The partition function of lattice QCD is given by where DU is the Haar measure, U \u2208 SU(3) are the gauge fields on the lattice links (x, \u03bc) and { \u03c7x , \u03c7 x } are the unrooted staggered fermions at the lattice sites x.\nThe gauge action S G [U] is given by the Wilson plaquette action and the staggered fermion action S F [ \u03c7, \u03c7, U] is: where the gauge action depends on the inverse gauge coupling \u03b2 = 2Nc g 2 and the fermion action depends on the quark chemical potential a\u00b5 q which favors quarks in the positive temporal direction, and the bare quark mass am q .\nFirst we consider the strong coupling limit where the inverse gauge coupling \u03b2=0 and hence the gauge action S G [U] drops out from the partition function in this limit. The gauge integration is over terms depending only on the individual links (x, \u03bc) so the partition function factorizes into a product of one-link integrals and we can write it as:\nwith z(x, \u03bc) the one-link gauge integral that can be eval-uated from invariant integration, as discussed in , where we write the one-link integral in terms of new hadronic variables: Only terms of the form (M (x)M (y)) k x, \u03bc (with k x,\u03bc called dimers which count the number of meson hoppings) and B(y)B(x) and B(x)B(y) (called baryon links) are present in the solution of the one-link integral.\nThe sites x and y = x + \u03bc are adjacent lattice sites. It remains to perform the Grassmann integral of the fermion fields \u03c7, \u03c7. This requires to expand the exponential containing the quark mass in Eq. (4) (left), which results in the terms (2am q M (x)) nx (with n x called monomers). To obtain non-vanishing results, at every site, the 2N c Grassman variables \u03c7 x,i and \u03c7x,i have to appear exactly once, resulting in the Grassmann constraint (GC):\nwhere n x is the number of monomers, k x,\u03bc is the number of dimers and the baryons form self-avoiding loops x,\u03bc , which due to the constraint cannot coexist with monomers or dimers. With this, we obtain an exact rewriting of the partition function Eq. ( ) for N c = 3, in terms of integer-valued dual degrees of freedom {n, k, }:\nwhere the sum over valid configurations has to respect the constraint (GC). The first term in the partition function is the contribution from dimers and the second term is the contribution from monomers. The weight factor w( ) for each baryon loop depends on the baryon chemical potential \u00b5 B = 3\u00b5 q and induces a sign factor \u03c3( ) which depends on the geometry of :\nHere, \u03c9 is the winding number of the loop . The total sign factor \u03c3( ) \u2208 {\u00b11} is explicitly calculated for every configuration. We apply sign reweighting as the dual formulation has a mild sign problem: baryons are non-relativistic and usually have loop geometries that have a positive signs. The dual partition function of the strong coupling limit is simulated with the worm algorithm (see Section III A) and the sign problem is essentially solved in this limit.\n\nExtension to finite \u03b2\n\nThe leading order gauge corrections O(\u03b2) to the strong coupling limit are obtained by expanding the Wilson gauge action Eq. ( ) before integrating out the gauge links. A formal expression is obtained by changing the order of integration (first gauge links, then Grassmann-valued fermions) within the QCD partition function:\nWith this the O (\u03b2) partition function is The challenge in computing Z (1) is to address the SU(N c ) integrals that receive contributions from the elementary plaquette U P . Link integration no longer factorizes, however the tr[U P ] can be decomposed before integration: Integrals of the type J ij with two open color indices -as compared to link integration at strong coupling -have been derived from generating functions\nfor either J = 0 or for G = U(N c ) . The SU(3) result was discussed in , in terms of the dual variables, neglecting rotation and reflection symmetries, there are 19 distinct diagrams to be considered. The resulting partition function, valid to O(\u03b2), is with q P \u2208 {0, \u00b11}, and the site weights w x \u2192 \u0175x , bond weights w b \u2192 \u0175b and baryon loop weights w \u2192 \u0175 receive modifications compared to the strong coupling limit Eq. ( ) for sites and bonds adjacent to an excited plaquette q P = 1.\nThe weights are given in , and are rederived for any gauge group in . The configurations {n, k, , q p } must satisfy at each site x the constraint inherited from Grassmann integration: which is the modified version of Eq. ( ) with q x = 1 if located at the corner of an excited plaquette q p = 0, otherwise q x = 0.\nA more general expression that we obtained via group theory and is valid to higher orders of the strong coupling expansion is discussed in terms of tensor networks . A typical 2-dimensional configuration that arises at \u03b2 = 1 in the Monte Carlo simulations is given in Fig. . Note that if a baryon loop enters a non-trivial plaquette, one quark is separated from the two other quarks, resulting in the baryon being extended object, rather being point-like in the strong coupling limit.\nThe O(\u03b2) partition function has been used in the chiral limit to study the full \u00b5 B \u2212 T plane via reweighting from the strong coupling ensemble. Whereas the second order chiral transition for small values of the a\u00b5 B decreased up to the tri-critical point, the first order nuclear transition was invariant: a\u00b5 1st B 1.78(1) at zero temperature has no \u03b2-dependence.\nFor the ratio T (\u00b5 B = 0)\/\u00b5 1st B (T 0) we found the values 0.787 for \u03b2 = 0 and 0.529 \u03b2 = 1, which should be compared to T c \/ 0.165 for full QCD . However, since reweighting cannot be fully trusted across a first order boundary, direct simulations at nonzero \u03b2 are necessary. The Monte Carlo technique to update plaquette variables is discussed in Section III A.\nIn this section, we provide analytic results from exact enumeration for small volumes, and mean field results based on the 1\/d expansion, valid in the thermodynamic limit. The main purpose is to compare our Monte Carlo results to these analytic predictions.\n\nExact enumeration\n\nTo establish that our Monte Carlo simulations indeed sample the partition functions Eq. ( ) and Eq. ( ), we have obtained analytic results on a 2 4 volume at strong coupling, and at finite beta in two dimensions on a 4 \u00d7 4 volume, comparing O (\u03b2) and O \u03b2 2 truncations. Our strategy to obtain an exact enumeration of the partition function Z is to enumerate plaquette configurations first, then fixing the fermion fluxes which together with the gauge fluxes that are induced by the plaquettes form a singlet, a triplet or anti-triplet, i.e. on a given bond b, g b + f b \u2208 {\u22123, 0, 3}, and last we perform the monomerdimer enumeration on the available sites not saturated by fermions yet by a depth-first algorithm .\nAt strong coupling, with no plaquettes, g b = 0 and f b are baryonic fluxes. All observables that can be written in terms of derivatives of log(z), such as the baryon density, the chiral condensate, the energy density, and also the average sign, are shown in Fig.\n\nExpectations from mean field theory\n\nAnother analytical method to study strong coupling lattice QCD is the mean field approach, where the partition function is expanded in 1 d (d is the spatial dimension) and then a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation performed . After this procedure, the free energy is a function of temperature T , the chiral condensate \u03c3 and chemical potential \u00b5 B :\nhere E[m] is one-dimensional quark excitation energy which is a function of the quark mass m = am q . For N c = 3 and d = 3 we determined the minimum of the free energy with respect to the chiral condensate. This gives us the equilibrium chiral condensate as a function of (T, m, \u00b5 B ). The chiral condensate and the baryon density as a function of the baryon chemical potential in lattice units a\u00b5 B and for various temperatures at quark mass m = 1.5 is shown in Fig. . We have determined the critical temperature to be aT c = 0.23 , which is characterized by an infinite slope of the chiral condensate.\nFor lower temperatures, there is a clear discontinuity of the chiral con-densate, separating the low density phase from the high density phase. For temperatures above and in the vicinity of aT c the chiral condensate and baryon density has no discontinuity but rapidly changes, corresponding to a crossover transition.\nWith this method, the phase diagram is plotted for different quark masses in Fig. . The second order phase transition in the chiral limit is plotted in solid blue line, the dotted lines show the first order phase transition for different quark masses and the solid red line indicates the critical end point for the different quark masses.\nMean field theory also gives an expression for the pion mass am \u03c0 and the baryon mass am B : The mean field baryon mass for N c = 3, d = 3 is also plotted in red in Fig. . Whereas the baryon mass is around N c in the chiral limit (am B 3.12 for N c = 3), it approximately doubles at m = 3.5 (am B 6.28) which corresponds to the pion mass am \u03c0 = 4.45, i.e. m \u03c0 \/m B = 0.708.\nHence, at around bare mass m = 3.5, the valence quark mass of the baryon corresponds roughly to 1\/3 of the chiral limit value of the baryon mass. The first Monte Carlo simulations that could extend in the \u00b5 B \u2212 T plane was the MDP algorithm , but it required the introduction of the worm algorithm to make substantial progress.\nFirst studies of the worm algorithm applied to the strong coupling limit QCD (with gauge group U(3)) are , and for gauge group SU . Monte Carlo simulations to extend the worm to incorporate leading order corrections were first proposed in . We will shortly review the setup of or Monte Carlo strategy for the nuclear transition, with an emphasis on the challenges to address large quark masses.\n\nStrong Coupling\n\nWithout any further resummation, there is a mild sign problem in the dual formulation of lattice QCD in the strong coupling limit. When the average sign \u03c3 is not too small (close to zero), it implies that most of the configurations have a positive weight thus allowing us to perform sign reweighting strategies.\nIn Fig. , \u2206f is plotted as a function of the baryon chemical potential and the quark masses. It is seen that \u2206f is close to zero for most cases except near the critical chemical potential and for small quark masses, but never exceeds 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Hence sign reweighting can be performed in the full parameter space.\nThe result that the sign problem becomes even milder when increasing the mass is related to the fact that larger critical chemical potentials result in a larger fraction of static baryons (spatial baryon hoppings become rare). FIG. . \u2206F at strong coupling as a function of chemical potential and quark mass on a 6 3 \u00d7 8.\nThe sign problem becomes milder as the quark mass increases.\n\nFinite \u03b2\n\nAll runs at finite \u03b2 have been obtained for N \u03c4 = 4, which corresponds to a moderately low temperature aT = 0.25 compared to the value of the chiral transition aT 1.54. Those simulations were too expensive to attempt N \u03c4 = 8 runs, in particular as a higher statistics was required. The spatial volumes are 4 3 , 6 3 and 8 3 .\nFor \u03b2 values are from 0.0 to 1.0 with step size 0.1, and for am q values from 0.00 to 1.00 with step size 0.01. The values of a\u00b5 were chosen close to the nuclear transition, the scanning range is shifted to large values as am q increases. At small quark masses the scanning range is from a\u00b5 = 0.4 to 1.0 and for the large quark masses, it is from 0.6 to 1.2 with step size 0.01.\nThe statistics used for are 15 \u00d7 10 4 measurements and between measurement, 40 \u00d7 N 3 s worm updates.\n\nResidual sign problem\n\nAlthough it is possible to resum the sign problem at strong coupling with a resummation of baryon and pion world lines, this is not possible when including gauge corrections. In order to compare both sign problems, we kept the original dual formulation to monitor the severity of the sign problem. This is done via the relation\nbetween the average sign \u03c3 and the difference of the free energy density \u2206f between the full ensemble f and of the sign-quenched ensemble f || .\n\nNuclear interactions\n\nWe have found that a\u00b5 1st B is very different from the baryon mass. This must be due to strong attractive interactions of nucleons. In contrast to continuum physics, in the strong coupling limit there is no pion exchange due to the Grassmann constraint. Instead, nucleons are point like and hard core repulsive.\nHowever, the pion bath, which is modified by the presence of static baryons, results in an attractive interaction. In , this has been analyzed in the chiral limit using the snake algorithm, and it has been found that the attractive force is of entropic origin. Here, we do not quantify the nuclear interaction via the nuclear potential, but via the difference between critical baryon chemical potential and baryon mass, in units baryon mass, as shown in Fig. , given the am B as measured in Section III C.\nThis compares better to the 3dim. effective theory. The nuclear interaction is maximal and more than 40% in the chiral limit, which is related to pions being massless: the modification of the pion bath is maximal. We clearly find that the nuclear interaction decreases drastically and almost linearly until it almost approaches zero at about am q = 2.0, corresponding to a pion mass am \u03c0 = 3.36, see Section II B. The large error bars for larger quark masses, that are due to the subtraction of almost same magnitudes, makes it difficult to extract a non-zero nuclear interaction at the largest quark masses.\nIn this work, we have determined the baryon mass and the nuclear transition via Monte Carlo: the worm algorithm based on the dual formulation, at finite \u03b2 equipped with additional updates. All those numerical results and various analytic expressions are summarized in Fig. . We find that as the quark mass becomes large, spatial mesons hoppings (i.e.\nspatial dimers) become rare, which makes this 3+1-dimensional system closer to 1dim. QCD . Also, both the baryon mass and the baryon chemical potential obtained in our dual representation, i.e. for staggered fermions, approaches the baryon mass of the 3-dim. effective theory which is based on Wilson fermions.\nAnother comparison that summarizes the validity of the mean field approach discussed in Section II B is shown in Fig. . It is evident that mean field theory has strong deviations for small quark masses, but this discrepancy becomes smaller for larger quark masses. The extension of the study of the nuclear transition to finite inverse gauge coupling \u03b2 is summarized in Fig. , which shows the \u03b2-dependence of a\u00b5 c B for various quark masses.\nFor all quark masses ranging from am q = 0 to am q = 1.0, there is only a very weak \u03b2-dependence, confirming the expectation from mean field theory . This works was restricted to isotropic lattices \u03be = a\/a t = 1, i.e. we performed simulations at fixed temperature. Non-isotropic lattices are necessary to vary the temperature at fixed values of \u03b2.\nThis requires to include two bare anisotropies, \u03b3 for the fermionic action and \u03b3 G for the gauge action. Finite \u03b2 has only been studied by us in the chiral limit . Clearly, it is interesting to study the location of the nuclear critical point also including higher order gauge corrections and at finite quark mass.\nSimulations including O(\u03b2 2 ) are under preparation.","label":"longbench","length":5265,"title":"Paper Info"}

On each player's turn he or she can do one of three things: \n\n(1) Draw a card.\n(2) Play a card that forms a marriage, i.e. is paired with a card of the opposite sex, after which the player then draws a card.\n(3) Play a card as a child of a marriage that is already on the board.  Most importantly, the three genetic characteristics of a child must be included in the six characteristics of its parents (e.g. so a child's one \"ear\" and two \"lips\" traits must be appear in its parents' six genetic traits).  Every trait symbol on the child's card scores one point for that genetic trait times the generation number of that child.  After scoring, the player may then discard a card from his or her hand, and then draw a replacement.The game ends when the seventh child is played in the fifth \"generation\".\n\nBluffing\nThe genetic trait of the each player's \"family\" is chosen randomly at the start of the game, being kept hidden from all other players and only revealed at the end of the game.  The scores of all five genetic characteristics are tracked throughout the course of the game (even if there are only two players), allowing players to bluff and misdirect their opponents.  \nAt the end of the game, players reveal their own genetic trait and are penalized for cards left in hand, the winner being\nthe one with the highest score.\n\nExternal links\nFamilienbande   at BoardGameGeek\nIndependent review of Familienbande at juegos.games\nIndependent review of Familienbande\nPassage 6:\nInkognito\nInkognito is a board game for 3 to 5  players designed by Alex Randolph and Leo Colovini first published in 1988 by Milton Bradley Company. It has since been republished several times including by the company Venice Connection established by the designers and Dario De Toffoli.The game was inspired by the Italian card game Briscola Chiamata.\n\nPlay Overview\nInkognito is a spy game set in Venice. It is unique in that the players play in pairs, but no player knows who their partner is.  Each player has half of a secret message detailing their party's mission; their partner is the player with the other half. In order to win, a player must:\n\nfigure out who their partner really is\nget the other half of the secret message from their partner\ndiscover their party's mission\ncomplete the missionWith 5 players, one player plays as the ambassador, who wins if he can perfectly identify all the other players.\n\nAwards\nIn 1988 this game won the Spiel des Jahres special award for most beautiful game.\n\nReviews\nJeux & Strat\u00e9gie #57 (as \"Intrigues \u00e0 Venise\")\nPassage 7:\nLeo Colovini\nLeo Colovini is an Italian designer of German-style board games born in Venice 1964. His most popular game is Cartagena. He is one of the few top board game designers who has owned a game store.\nHis life in games was strongly influenced by meeting Alex Randolph at the age of 12 with whom he worked on several of his games. He has also been part of studiogiochi, an Italian games company, and has also collaborated with Dario De Toffoli and has written books on games.\n\nList of Games\nComplete list of games that Colovini has created:\n\nHis games are known for their simplicity and drama as this quote from Board Game Geek illustrates:  \"Carcasonne: The Discovery is also the simplest and most vanilla of the Carcassonnes. (Of course, if you know anything about Leo Colovini, you'd expect that.) But, it also the most tense Carcassonne. (And if you know Mr. Colovini, you also knew THAT!)\"\nPassage 8:\nFrancis Tresham (game designer)\nFrancis Tresham (1936 \u2013 23 October 2019) was a British board game designer who produced board games since the early 1970s. Tresham founded and ran games company Hartland Trefoil (founded 1971), a company well-known for its Civilization board game, until its sale to MicroProse in 1997. His 1829 game was the first of the 18xx board game series and some of his board games inspired Sid Meier computer games such as Railroad Tycoon.\nFrancis Tresham was the first to introduce a technology tree into his boardgames. This idea had a large influence on later board and computer games.\nHe was managing director of Tresham Games, which produced 18xx-style board games. In 2013, he was one of the first inductees in the UK Games Expo Hall of Fame.

A player's representative on the gameboard made of a piece of material made to look like a known object (such as a scale model of a person, animal, or inanimate object) or otherwise general symbol. Each player may control one or more pieces. Some games involve commanding multiple pieces, such as chess pieces or Monopoly houses and hotels, that have unique designations and capabilities within the parameters of the game; in other games, such as Go, all pieces controlled by a player have the same capabilities. In some modern board games, such as Clue, there are other pieces that are not a player's representative (i.e. weapons). In some games, such as mancala games, pieces may not represent or belong to any particular player. Mancala pieces are undifferentiated and  typically seeds but sometimes beans, coins, cowry shells, ivory balls, or pebbles. Note that in chess usage the term piece in some contexts only refers to some of the pieces, which are also known as chessmen.

Alternatively, a unique position on the board on which a piece in play may be located. For example, in Go, the pieces are placed on grid line intersections called points, and not in the areas bounded by the borders, as in chess. The bounded area geometries can be square (e.g. chess), rectangular (e.g. shogi), hexagonal (e.g. Chinese Checkers), triangular (e.g. Bizingo), quadrilateral (e.g. three-player chess), cubic (e.g. Raumschach), or other shapes (e.g. Circular chess).

As an art director, he won the Oscar for Best Art Direction in 1942 for How Green Was My Valley, along with  Richard Day and Thomas Little. His work on The Razor's Edge in 1946 also received an Academy nomination. In the 1950s, he began to direct, and was known for science fiction and fantasy films such as Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. He was also the brother of quality guru Joseph M. Juran.\n\nLife and career\nEarly life\nJuran was born to a Jewish family in Gura Humorului, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Romania).In 1912, he emigrated to America with his family, settling in Minneapolis. He earned a bachelor's degree in Architecture from the University of Minnesota. He also spent a summer studying at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts before earning a master's degree in Architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He passed the architect's exam and set up his own office as an architect.\n\nArt department\nWith the construction industry at a standstill due to the Great Depression, Juran moved to Los Angeles. He sought architecture work at the studios and got a job doing a drawing of the Brooklyn Bridge for RKO Radio Pictures. He managed to get a permanent job as a draftsman in the art department. He was an assistant art director on Quality Street (1937).\nJuaran later moved to MGM, where he assisted in designing Juliet's bedroom in Romeo and Juliet (1936). He then joined 20th Century Fox, assisting art department head Richard Day on How Green Was My Valley (1941).Fox liked his work and put Juran under contract. His early credits as art director included Charley's American Aunt (1941), and Belle Starr (1941), and he and Day won an Oscar for their work on Valley.Juran also worked on I Wake Up Screaming (1941), A Gentleman at Heart (1942), Ten Gentlemen from West Point (1942), The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe (1942), Dr. Renault's Secret (1942), It's Everybody's War (1942, a short), and That Other Woman (1942).\nJuran enlisted in the Navy during the Second World War in July 1942 and was assigned to first the Office of Strategic Services and then to the Royal Air Force Intelligence Center.After the war, Juran returned to Fox, winning an Oscar nomination for his work on The Razor's Edge (1946).\nJuran accepted a seven-year contract to be head of the art department for Enterprise Productions. While there he was credited on The Other Love (1947) and Body and Soul (1947). When Enterprise collapsed, Juran did Kiss the Blood Off My Hands (1948) for Harold Hecht and Tulsa (1948) for Walter Wanger.\n\nUniversal\nJuran then signed a long-term contract with Universal, where he was the art director on Free for All (1949), Undertow (1949), Winchester '73 (1950), Deported (1950), Harvey (1950), Bright Victory (1951), Thunder on the Hill (1951), Reunion in Reno (1951), Cave of Outlaws (1951), The Strange Door (1951), Meet Danny Wilson (1951), Bend of the River (1952) and Untamed Frontier (1952).\n\nDirector\nJuran was assigned as art department head for The Black Castle (1952), when director Joseph Pevney dropped out shortly before filming. Juran was asked to take over as director two weeks prior to filming.Universal was happy with Juran's work and signed him to a one-year directing contract. He made an Audie Murphy Western Gunsmoke (1952), and a Ronald Reagan Western Law and Order (1953), then did The Golden Blade (1953), an \"Eastern\" with Rock Hudson and Tumbleweed (1953) with Murphy.\nJuran went to Italy in 1954 to direct a swashbuckler, Knights of the Queen (1954), based on The Three Musketeers. He then directed some episodes of a TV series based on the movie.\nJuran returned to Hollywood to direct an independent film, Highway Dragnet (1954) based on a story by Roger Corman. After The Big Moment (1954) at Paramount he went back to Universal to do Drums Across the River (1954) with Murphy.Juran directed episodes of Fury (1954), Crossroads and My Friend Flicka on TV, and The Crooked Web (1955) for Sam Katzman at Columbia.\n\nScience fiction and fantasy\nJuran's first science fiction film was The Deadly Mantis (1957) at Universal. He followed this with Hellcats of the Navy (1957) starring Ronald Reagan and his wife (who was billed as Nancy Davis). It was his first film for producer Charles H. Schneer. Schneer hired Juran for 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957) with special effects by Ray Harryhausen. This film established Juran in the science fiction and fantasy genres.\nSchneer hired him to do another movie with Harryhausen, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1957). It was a commercial and critical success. Instead of continuing with A features, he accepted two jobs \"for the money\", in his own words: The Brain from Planet Arous (1957) then Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1957). Both became cult classics. He was unhappy with how Arous turned out and arranged for his billing to be \"Nathan Hertz\".\nJuran did a Western for Schneer, Good Day for a Hanging (1958) and, for TV, episodes of Frances Langford Presents, World of Giants, and Men Into Space (1960).\nJuran got back into features with a motion picture he wrote himself, Jack the Giant Killer (1962) for producer Edward Small. He then did Flight of the Lost Balloon (1961), which was released first, an adventure heavily influenced by Jules Verne, which he co-wrote and directed. Around this time he provided the stories for, but did not direct, Doctor Blood's Coffin (1961) and Boy Who Caught a Crook (1961) and wrote a draft of Son of Captain Blood.Jurana did some second unit directing on MGM's Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). Schneer hired Juran to direct Siege of the Saxons (1963) and First Men in the Moon (1964) (based on the novel by H. G. Wells with effects by Harryhausen).  He did an imperial adventure for Schneer, East of Sudan (1964) and directed second unit on Cyrano et d'Artagnan (1964).\n\nTelevision\nJuran turned to television in 1959. He directed episodes of A Man Called Shenandoah and Daniel Boone, and episodes of all four of Irwin Allen's 1960s science fiction series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, The Time Tunnel and Land of the Giants.\n\nLast films\nHe did a feature for Schneer, Land Raiders (1970), a Western, before an operation for cancer prompted him to retire in 1970. Juran returned from retirement to direct The Boy Who Cried Werewolf (1973) with his old Sinbad star, Kerwin Mathews. He then returned to his first career, architecture.In 1999, he was honored with the Lifetime Career Award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, USA.\nHe died at the age of 95 in Palos Verdes, California, US.\n\nPartial filmography\nAs art director\nHow Green Was My Valley (1942)\nThe Razor's Edge (1946)As director\nThe Black Castle (1952)\nLaw and Order (1953)\nGunsmoke (1953)\nThe Golden Blade (1953)\nTumbleweed (1953)\nDrums Across the River (1954)\nHighway Dragnet (1954)\nThe Crooked Web (1955)\nThe Deadly Mantis (1957)\n20 Million Miles to Earth (1957)\nHellcats of the Navy (1957)\nThe Brain from Planet Arous (1957)\nThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958)\nAttack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958)\nGood Day for a Hanging  (1959)\nFlight of the Lost Balloon (1961)\nBoy Who Caught a Crook (1961)\nJack the Giant Killer (1962)\nSiege of the Saxons (1963)\nFirst Men in the Moon (1964)\nEast of Sudan (1964)\nLand Raiders (1970)\nThe Boy Who Cried Werewolf (1973)\nPassage 5:\nGunsmoke (film)\nGunsmoke is a 1953 American Western film directed by Nathan Juran and starring Audie Murphy, Susan Cabot, and Paul Kelly. The film has no connection to the contemporary radio and later TV series of the same name. The film was based on the 1951 novel Roughshod by Norman A. Fox.\n\nPlot\nMurphy stars as Reb Kittridge, a wandering hired gun who is hired to get the deeds of the last remaining ranch not owned by local boss Matt Telford. That last ranch is owned by Dan Saxon.  Though Reb has not yet accepted the job he is ambushed by Saxon's ramrod, ranch foreman Curly Mather, who kills his horse.  Once in town, he is challenged to a gun fight by Saxon, but shoots Saxon in his gun hand instead of with a killing shot.\nSaxon, a former wild outlaw who has settled down, senses Reb has good in him and when he hears Reb's goal in life is to own his own ranch he loses the deed of the ranch to Reb in a card draw.  It is obvious he does this on purpose since he earlier won a similar contest by outdrawing his opponent's king.\nReb takes over the ranch and moving its cattle herd to a railhead for sale to the workers.  Telford hires Reb's fellow gunslinger and sometime friend, Johnny Lake to stop the herd and Reb.  Reb has also fallen in love with Rita, the rancher's daughter, who currently is in love with Mather.\n\nCast\nAudie Murphy as Reb Kittridge\nSusan Cabot as Rita Saxon\nPaul Kelly as Dan Saxon\nCharles Drake as Johnny Lake\nMary Castle as Cora Dufrayne\nJack Kelly as Curly Mather\nJesse White as Professor\nDonald Randolph as Matt Telford\nWilliam Reynolds as Brazos\nChubby Johnson as Doc Farrell\n\nProduction\nThe movie started filming in June 1952 under the title of Roughshod.

Hobson was also selected as a nationally outstanding engineer.Hobson married Jessie Eugertha Bell on March 26, 1939, and they had five children.\n\nCareer\nAwards and memberships\nHobson was named an IEEE Fellow in 1948.\nPassage 8:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and\/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 9:\nDana Blankstein\nDana Blankstein-Cohen (born March 3, 1981) is the executive director of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nBilliken\nThe Billiken is a charm doll created by an American art teacher and illustrator, Florence Pretz of Kansas City, Missouri, who is said to have seen the mysterious figure in a dream. It is believed that Pretz found the name Billiken in Bliss Carman's 1896 poem \"Mr. Moon: A Song Of The Little People\".  In 1908, she obtained a design patent on the ornamental design of the Billiken, which she sold to the Billiken Company of Chicago.  The Billiken was monkey-like with pointed ears, a mischievous smile and a tuft of hair on his pointed head. His arms were short and he was generally sitting with his legs stretched out in front of him. Billiken is known as \"The God of Things as They Ought to Be\".\nTo buy a Billiken was said to give the purchaser luck, but to receive one as a gift would be better luck. The image was copyrighted and a trademark was put on the name. After a few years of popularity, the Billiken faded into obscurity. Although they are similar, the Billiken and the baby-like kewpie figures that debuted in the December 1909 Ladies' Home Journal are not the same.\nToday, the Billiken is the official mascot of Saint Louis University and St. Louis University High School, both Jesuit institutions located in St. Louis. The Billiken is also the official mascot of the Royal Order of Jesters, an invitation only Shriner group affiliated with Freemasonry. The Billiken also became the namesake of Billiken Shokai, the Japanese toy & model manufacturing company (established 1976).\n\nHistory\nThe Billiken sprang from the height of the \"Mind-Cure\" craze in the United States at the start of the twentieth century.  It represented the \"no worry\" ideal, and was a huge hit.  Variations appeared, such as the \"Teddy-Billiken Doll\" and the Billycan\/Billycant pair (to drive petty problems away).  The Billiken helped touch off the doll craze of the era.At least two Billiken-themed songs were recorded, including \"Billiken Rag\" and the \"Billiken Man Song.\" The latter was recorded by Blanche Ring.The Billiken, as a good luck charm, appears multiple times in the Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor movie Waterloo Bridge.  It is employed as a device that both prompts recollections of the male lead, Robert Taylor, and that links several scenes within the movie as the plot unfolds. Wizard of Oz author L. Frank Baum kept a Billiken doll on his piano.The Billiken made its Japanese debut in 1908. A statue was installed in the uppermost level of the original Tsutenkaku Tower as it was opened to the public in 1912. When the nearby Luna Park was closed in 1925, the tower's Billiken statue disappeared. In 1980, a replacement statue made its appearance in a new Tsutenkaku Tower that was built in 1956.\n\nSports mascot\nIn its heyday, the Billiken enjoyed worldwide celebrity.  In the United States he became the athletic mascot of Saint Louis University, because the figure was said to resemble coach John R. Bender.  The school's athletic teams remain the Billikens to this day. A bronze statue of the Billiken stands in front of the Chaifetz Arena on the Saint Louis University Campus.  A junior version of the Billiken became the mascot of nearby St. Louis University High School; a stainless steel statue of the Junior Billiken stands adjacent to the Danis Fieldhouse, on the St. Louis University High School Campus. Bud Billiken was a youth-club mascot for The Chicago Defender, and was created in 1923, and is known more contemporarily as the inspiration for the yearly parade of the same name held shortly before the start of the school year.\nThe Billiken was the team nickname for several minor league professional baseball teams, including the Fort Wayne Billikens of the 1908\u20131910 Central League, the Montgomery Billikens of the 1910 Southern Association (a Class A league that ran from 1902\u20131935), the Bay City Billikens of the 1911 and 1912 Southern Michigan League (a league that dwelled in several classifications between 1906 and 1912), and the McLeansboro Billikens of the 1910 Kentucky\u2013Illinois\u2013Tennessee League (\"KITTY League\"), a Class D professional baseball league that ran from 1903 until 1955. McLeansboro is located in southern Illinois, 116 miles from St. Louis.\n\nAlaska\nIn 1909, the Billiken began its appearance in souvenir shops of Alaska. In Nome, Alaska, an Inuit carver by the name Angokwazhuk copied a Billiken figurine in ivory brought to him by a merchant. Since that first appearance in Alaska, some Inuit carvers began to include the billiken in the collection of figurines they created. By the 1960s the Billiken was ubiquitous in larger Alaskan cities like Anchorage, and heavily touristed areas. Billikens were often carved from Alaskan ivory and were used in jewelry and knick-knacks. Often these souvenirs were accompanied by printed, romanticized Billiken lore. In Anchorage, the name was also adopted by merchants, as in the Billiken Drive-In movie theater.\n\nJapan\nThroughout Japan representations of the Billiken were enshrined. Pre-World War II statues of the Billiken could be found in Kobe city's Chinju Inari and Matsuo Inari shrines. Both of these statues were removed from display for many years at the onset of the war when foreign deities fell out of favor.\nThe most famous representation of the Billiken was in an amusement park, Luna Park, in the Shinsekai district of Osaka, Japan.  In 1912, he was enshrined in the park as a symbol of Americana and there was revered as \"The God of Things As They Ought to Be\". Popular Billiken souvenirs in the park included dolls and manj\u016b. When the park closed in 1923, the wooden statue of the Billiken went missing.\nA replica of the statue was placed in the second-generation Ts\u016btenkaku Tower in 1980. The Billiken was a star in Sakamoto Junji's 1996 comedy Billiken in which the statue is restored to the Tsutenkaku in an effort to revive the popularity of the tower and save Shinsekai.The statue was a permanent fixture in the tower until September 2005 when it made its first departure and was taken, as an ambassador of sorts, to Shibuya's Tokyu Hands department store in Tokyo as a part of a fair to promote Naniwa (traditional Osaka) culture.  As a part of the cultural exchange, a replica of the statue of Shibuya's most famous dog, Hachik\u014d, was sent to Osaka.\nIn October 2008, the Billiken of Tsutenkaku took a journey all the way from Japan to its \"home\" city of St. Louis, Missouri where it was visited by students of St. Louis University, whose mascot is also the Billiken.\nDue to wear (particularly to the soles of the feet), the dark, worn statue replica from 1980 was replaced in May 2012 with a new one. Presently he resides on the fifth floor observation deck and has become closely associated with the tower. Each year thousands of visitors place a coin in his donation box and rub the soles of his well-worn feet to make their wishes come true.\nThe Billiken also became the namesake of Billiken Shokai, the Japanese toy & model manufacturing company established in 1976.\n\nNotes\nSee also\nBilliken, an Argentine children's magazine named after the doll\nPassage 2:\nEconomy of Saint Lucia\nOnce a single-crop agricultural economy, Saint Lucia has shifted to a tourism and banking serviced-based economy. Tourism, the island's biggest industry and main source of jobs, income and foreign exchange, accounts for 65% of its GDP. Agriculture, which was once the biggest industry, now contributes to less than 3% of GDP, but still accounts for 20% of jobs. The banana industry is now on a decline due to strong competition from low-cost Latin American producers and reduced European trade preferences, but the government has helped revitalize the industry, with 13,734 tonnes exported in 2018. Agricultural crops grown for export are bananas, mangoes, and avocados. The island is considered to have the most diverse and well-developed manufacturing industry in the eastern Caribbean.\nSaint Lucia has been able to attract many foreign businesses and investors.\n\nEconomic history\nThe island's banana output was heavily impacted in 2007 by  Hurricane Dean. In 2006, the governor stated:\n\nWhile living standards have improved for many, a large number of people have been pushed to the margin of economic activity, especially in the areas which once depended heavily on the banana industry for a livelihood.\n\nSectors\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is the second-largest industry in Saint Lucia. In 2020, agriculture only contributed 2.2% to Saint Lucia's GDP, but still accounts for a significant number of jobs - some 10% of the employed population. As of the 2010 census, the roughly 10,000 agricultural holdings covered an area of 30,204 acres, an average of 3.0 acres per agricultural holding.\nAbout 18% of the land is used for agricultural practices. Most farms consist of less than 5 acres of land. The main agricultural products grown in Saint Lucia are bananas, coconuts, cocoa beans, mangoes, avocados, vegetables, citrus fruits, and root crops such as yams and sweet potatoes. Most of these agricultural products are grown for local consumption, but bananas and coconuts are mainly grown for export, with some vegetables. Bananas occupy about 14,826 acres of the agricultural land, while coconuts occupy 12,400 acres.\nSaint Lucia has a small livestock sector, which is dominated by poultry and pork. The island is self-sufficient in egg production and is trying to become self-sufficient in poultry and pork production. The Ministry of Agriculture is encouraging farmers to raise sheep and goats to reduce the island's importation of frozen meats, and has helped by providing support to farmers, importing bloodlines of livestock to increase the productivity of animals, and providing subsidies on animal feed.\nHelp is also being given to revitalize the local dairy and beef industries through the introduction of efficient cattle breeds, training of farmers to care properly for livestock, and establishing funds for the construction of dairy units and abattoirs.\nThe island is also looking to expand its exports under the Taste of Saint Lucia brand sponsored by Export Saint Lucia. Products that are being promoted include Saint Lucia Honey, rum, chocolate, coconut oil, granola, and insect repellent.\n\nTourism\nThe island currently attracts over 900,000 visitors annually. St Lucia has been able to attract foreign businesses and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries. Tourism is St Lucia's main source of jobs and income, accounting for 65% of GDP, and the island's main source of foreign exchange earnings. The northern end of St Lucia is tourism's most urbanized area, with a fair number of hotels and resorts located along beaches, or with seaside views. This is also home to many of the island's large, all-inclusive resorts.\n\nEconomic trends\nThe level of island households living at or below the poverty level increased from 18.7 to 21.4% from 1995 to 2005. As of 2006, another 16.2% of the island's population are vulnerable to economic shocks that could easily push them below the poverty line.  One rural district had 44.9% of households living below the poverty line (2005).To broaden the island's economic base, the government added small, computer-driven information technology and financial services as development objectives.\nSt. Lucia's leading revenue producers\u2014agriculture, tourism, and small-scale manufacturing\u2014benefited from a focus on infrastructure improvements in roads, communications, water supply, sewerage, and port facilities. Foreign investors also have been attracted by the infrastructure improvements and by the educated and skilled work force and relatively stable political conditions. The largest investment is in a petroleum storage and transshipment terminal built by Hess Oil. The Caribbean Development Bank  funded an airport expansion project.\nUntil the events of 11 September 2001, the tourism sector had made significant gains, experiencing a boom despite some untimely and destructive hurricanes. Stay-over visitors and cruise arrivals declined in 2001, and several hotels declared bankruptcy, including the Hyatt. The development of the tourism sector remains a priority, and the government is committed to providing a favourable investment environment. Incentives are available for building and upgrading tourism facilities. Use of public funds to improve the physical infrastructure of the island has been liberal, and the government has made efforts to attract cultural and sporting events and develop historical sites.\n\nOverview\nSt. Lucia's economy depends primarily on revenue from tourism and banana production, with some contribution from small-scale manufacturing.\nAlthough banana revenues have helped fund the country's development since the 1960s, the industry is now in a terminal decline, due to reduced European Union trade preferences and competition from lower-cost Latin American banana producers. The country is encouraging farmers to plant crops such as cocoa, mangoes, and avocados to diversify its agricultural production and provide jobs for displaced banana workers.\nTourism recovered in 2004, following the post-11 September 2001 recession, and continued to grow in 2005, making up more than 48% of St. Lucia's GDP. The hotel and restaurant industry grew by 6.3% during 2005. Stay-over arrivals increased by 6.5%, and the United States remained the most important market, accounting for 35.4% of these arrivals. Yacht passengers rose by 21.9%. Redeployment of cruise ships, remedial berth construction, and high fuel costs prevented higher growth rates. However, several investors have planned new tourism projects for the island, including a large hotel and resort in the southern part of the island. The global recession has caused a reduction in tourist revenue and foreign investment, significantly slowing growth rates.\nSt. Lucia's currency is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar (EC$), a regional currency shared among members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) issues the EC$, manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in its member countries. The ECCB has kept the EC$ pegged at EC$2.7 = US$1.\nSt. Lucia is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative and is a member of the Caribbean Community and Common Market.

It is distilled in Frankfort, Kentucky at the Buffalo Trace Distillery.\n\nHistory\nThe Blanton's brand was launched in 1984 under the guidance of the distillery's master distiller Elmer T. Lee, as the first modern bourbon brand marketed as a single barrel bourbon. The original brand name was \"Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon\". A single barrel bourbon is one for which each bottling batch is produced from the contents of only one particular aging barrel \u2013 not mixed with whiskey from any other barrels (and not blended with neutral spirits, colorings, or flavorings). The company says that producing a high quality whiskey using this production method requires constant monitoring of every barrel in the middle of the warehouse by the Master Distiller. The barrels are dumped by hand without using machinery. There are eight different stopper designs, each with a different letter of the alphabet molded into it and topped with a figurine of a racehorse and jockey.  When placed in order, spelling \"B L A N T O N: S\", the horse and jockey's poses display eight different scenes of a horse race, from standing at the gate, to crossing the finish line with a win.\nBlanton's Single Barrel Bourbon is typically aged for 6 to 8 years. It is aged in Warehouse H at Buffalo Trace, which is the only metal-cladded warehouse at Buffalo Trace and was commissioned for construction by one of the distillery's early leaders, Albert B. Blanton, shortly after the end of the Prohibition era. Being metal, the warehouse transfers heat quicker than brick warehouses, which allows for more rapid aging.There are multiple different expressions of Blanton's, each being a different proof. The original 93 proof Blanton's was the only expression available in the United States until 2020. That year, Sazerac Company announced domestic annual limited releases of 103 proof Blanton's Gold and cask proof Blanton's Straight From the Barrel.\n\nPrior to these announcements, both Gold and Straight From the Barrel were available exclusively in select international markets. \nOther export-only expressions are available in select international markets, including 80 proof Green Label Special Reserve, and the Japanese market's 80 proof Black Label, 93 proof Takara Red and 103 proof Takara Gold, all of which are aged for an additional two years. From 2014 to 2018 a 'Poland Limited Edition' release was bottled for the M&P Wine and Spirits Festival in Raszyn, Poland. Since 2019, this has been marketed as a 'Special Release' available to select European markets and retailers. Moreover, an annual collaboration with Parisian Whisky retailer La Maison du Whisky has been released every year since 2006, with the inaugural bottling celebrating the 50th Anniversary of La Maison, presented at their Whisky Festival.\n\nAlbert Blanton and the Buffalo Trace distillery\nBlanton's bourbon was named in honor of one of the distillery's early leaders, Albert B. Blanton, who the company claims spent most of his life preserving the tradition of handcrafted bourbon. Blanton worked at the facility now known as the Buffalo Trace Distillery for approximately 55 years. He was born and raised on a farm just outside Frankfort, Kentucky, and he began working at the distillery (then called the O.F.C. Distillery or Old Fire Copper Distillery) in 1897 as an office boy when he was 16 years old. Over the next few years, he reportedly worked in every department, and in 1912 he was appointed superintendent of the distillery, its warehouse, and bottling shop \u2013 at the same time that the distillery was renamed to become the George T. Stagg Distillery. He became president of the whiskey plant in 1921. Blanton died in 1959.\nThe company refers to him as \"Colonel Blanton\", as he held the honorific title of Kentucky Colonel (a relatively common honorific bestowed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky). The distillery had several owners during its history, and was renamed by its current owner, the Sazerac Company, to become the Buffalo Trace Distillery in 2001.\nElmer T. Lee, the originator of Blanton's, was hired by the distillery by Blanton in 1949. He introduced the Blanton's brand in 1984, a year before he retired, as the first modern brand of bourbon marketed as single barrel bourbon. Lee continued to act as an ambassador for Buffalo Trace until his death in 2013.\nPassage 4:\nAuguste Lev\u00eaque\nAuguste Lev\u00eaque (1866 \u2013 1921) was a Belgian painter influenced both by realism and symbolism.

Most notably, the fleur-de-lis is depicted on the traditional coat of arms of France that was used from the High Middle Ages until the French Revolution in 1792, and then again in brief periods in the 19th century. This design still represents France and the House of Bourbon in the form of marshalling in e.g. the arms of Spain, Quebec and Canada.\nOther European nations have also employed the symbol. The fleur-de-lis became \"at one and the same time, religious, political, dynastic, artistic, emblematic, and symbolic,\" especially in French heraldry. The Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph are among saints often depicted with a lily.\nThe fleur-de-lis is represented in Unicode at U+269C \u269c  in the Miscellaneous Symbols block.\n\nOrigin\nThe fleur-de-lis is widely thought to be a stylized version of the species Iris pseudacorus, or Iris florentina. However, the lily (genus Lilium, family Liliaceae) and the iris (family Iridaceae) are two different plants, phylogenetically and taxonomically unrelated. Lily (in Italian: giglio) is the name usually associated with the stylized flower in the Florentine heraldic devices.\nDecorative ornaments that resemble the fleur-de-lis have appeared in artwork from the earliest human civilizations. According to Pierre-Augustin Boissier de Sauvages, an 18th-century French naturalist and lexicographer:\nThe old fleurs-de-lis, especially the ones found in our first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas [in Occitan], or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, is the fact that the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Lys in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises \u2014as many plants grow for centuries in the same places\u2014: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.\n\nThe heraldist Fran\u00e7ois Velde is known to have expressed the same opinion:\nHowever, a hypothesis ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible to me. One species of wild iris, the Iris pseudacorus, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It is easy to imagine that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume would have been called 'fleur-de-lis'. This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag. There is a fanciful legend about Clovis which links the yellow flag explicitly with the French coat of arms.\nSauvages' hypothesis seems to be supported by the archaic English spelling fleur-de-luce and by the Luts's variant name Lits.\n\nAlternative derivations\nAnother (debated) hypothesis is that the symbol derives from the angon or sting,  a typical Frankish throwing spear. The medieval Bec de Corban, a bladed and hooked polearm, bears similarities to the symbol as well. \nA possibly derived symbol of Frankish royalty was the bee, of similar shape, as found in the burial of Childric I, whose royal see of power over the Salian Franks was based over the valley of the Lys.Other imaginative explanations include the shape having been developed from the image of a dove descending, which is the symbol of the Holy Ghost.\n\nAncient usages\nIt has consistently been used as a royal emblem, though different cultures have interpreted its meaning in varying ways. Gaulish coins show the first Western designs which look similar to modern fleurs-de-lis. In the East it was found on the gold helmet of a Scythian king uncovered at the Ak-Burun kurgan and conserved in Saint Petersburg's Hermitage Museum.\n\nHeraldic use\nFrance\nWhile the fleur-de-lis has appeared on countless European coats of arms and flags over the centuries, it is particularly associated with the French monarchy in a historical context and continues to appear in the arms of the king of Spain (from the French House of Bourbon), the grand duke of Luxembourg, and members of the House of Bourbon. It remains an enduring symbol of France which appears on French postage stamps, although it has never been adopted officially by any of the French republics. According to French historian Georges Duby, the three petals represent the three medieval social estates: the commoners, the nobility, and the clergy.Although the origin of the fleur-de-lis is unclear, it has retained an association with French nobility. It is widely used in French city emblems as in the coat of arms of the city of Lille, Saint-Denis, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Boulogne-Billancourt, and Calais. Some cities that had been particularly faithful to the French Crown were awarded a heraldic augmentation of two or three fleurs-de-lis on the chief of their coat of arms; such cities include Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Reims, Le Havre, Angers, Le Mans, Aix-en-Provence, Tours, Limoges, Amiens, Orl\u00e9ans, Rouen, Argenteuil, Poitiers, Chartres, and Laon, among others. The fleur-de-lis was the symbol of \u00cele-de-France, the core of the French kingdom. It has appeared on the coat-of-arms of other historical provinces of France including Burgundy, Anjou, Picardy, Berry, Orl\u00e9anais, Bourbonnais, Maine, Touraine, Artois, Dauphin\u00e9, Saintonge, and the County of La Marche. Many of the current French departments use the symbol on their coats-of-arms to express this heritage.\n\nThe graphic evolution of crita to fleur-de-lis was accompanied by textual allegory. By the late 13th century, an allegorical poem by Guillaume de Nangis (d. 1300), written at Joyenval Abbey in Chambourcy, relates how the golden lilies on an azure ground were miraculously substituted for the crescents on Clovis' shield, a projection into the past of contemporary images of heraldry.The fleur-de-lis' symbolic origins with French monarchs may stem from the baptismal lily used in the crowning of King Clovis I. The French monarchy may have adopted the Fleur-de-lis for its royal coat of arms as a symbol of purity to commemorate the conversion of Clovis I, and a reminder of the Fleur-de-lis ampulla that held the oil used to anoint the king. So, the fleur-de-lis stood as a symbol of the king's divinely approved right to rule. The thus \"anointed\" kings of France later maintained that their authority was directly from God. A legend enhances the mystique of royalty by informing us that a vial of oil\u2014the Holy Ampulla\u2014descended from Heaven to anoint and sanctify Clovis as King, descending directly on Clovis or perhaps brought by a dove to Saint Remigius. One version explains that an angel descended with the Fleur-de-lis ampulla to anoint the king. Another story tells of Clovis putting a flower in his helmet just before his victory at the Battle of Vouill\u00e9. Through this propagandist connection to Clovis, the fleur-de-lis has been taken in retrospect to symbolize all the Christian Frankish kings, most notably Charlemagne.In the 14th-century French writers asserted that the monarchy of France, which developed from the Kingdom of the West Franks, could trace its heritage back to the divine gift of royal arms received by Clovis. This story has remained popular, even though modern scholarship has established that the fleur-de-lis was a religious symbol before it was a true heraldic symbol. Along with true lilies, it was associated with the Virgin Mary, and in the 12th century Louis VI and Louis VII (House of Capet) started to use the emblem, on sceptres for example, so connecting their rulership with this symbol of saintliness and divine right. Louis VII ordered the use of fleur-de-lis clothing in his son Philip's coronation in 1179, while the first visual evidence of clearly heraldic use dates from 1211: a seal showing the future Louis VIII and his shield strewn with the \"flowers\". Until the late 14th century the French royal coat of arms was Azure sem\u00e9-de-lis Or (a blue shield \"sown\" (sem\u00e9) with a scattering of small golden fleurs-de-lis), but Charles V of France changed the design from an all-over scattering to a group of three in about 1376. These two coats are known in heraldic terminology as France Ancient and France Modern, respectively.\n\nIn the reign of King Louis IX (St. Louis) the three petals of the flower were said to represent faith, wisdom and chivalry, and to be a sign of divine favour bestowed on France. During the next century, the 14th, the tradition of Trinity symbolism was established in France, and then spread elsewhere.In 1328, King Edward III of England inherited a claim to the crown of France, and in about 1340 he quartered France Ancient with the arms of Plantagenet, as \"arms of pretence\".   After the kings of France adopted France Modern, the kings of England adopted the new design as quarterings from about 1411. The monarchs of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to quarter the French arms until 1801, when George III abandoned his formal claim to the French throne.King Charles VII ennobled Joan of Arc's family on 29 December 1429 with an inheritable symbolic denomination. The Chamber of Accounts in France registered the family's designation to nobility on 20 January 1430. The grant permitted the family to change their surname to du Lys.\n\nFrance Moderne\nFrance moderne remained the French royal standard, and with a white background was the French national flag until the French Revolution, when it was replaced by the tricolor of modern-day France. The fleur-de-lis was restored to the French flag in 1814, but replaced once again after the revolution against Charles X of France in 1830. In a very strange turn of events after the end of the Second French Empire, where a flag apparently influenced the course of history, Henri, comte de Chambord, was offered the throne as King of France, but he agreed only if France gave up the tricolor and brought back the white flag with fleurs-de-lis. His condition was rejected and France became a republic.\n\nOther contries\nIn Brazil, the city of Joinville has three fleurs-de-lis surmounted with a label of three points on its flag and coat of arms. Due to the city is named after Fran\u00e7ois d'Orl\u00e9ans, Prince of Joinville, son of King Louis-Philippe I of France, who married Princess Francisca of Brazil in 1843.\nThe fleur-de-lis appears on the coat of Guadeloupe, an overseas d\u00e9partement of France in the Caribbean, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, an overseas collectivity of France, and French Guiana. The overseas department of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean uses the same feature. It appears on the coat of Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius which was named in honour of King Louis XV. On the coat of arms of Saint Lucia it represents the French heritage of the country.\nIn Ukraine, the Foreign Intelligence Service used the emblem with the coat of arms of Ukraine in conjunction with four golden fleurs-de-lis, along with the motto \"Omnia, Vincit, Veritas\".\n\nMunicipal coats-of-arms\nFleurs-de-lis feature prominently in the Crown Jewels of England and Scotland. In English heraldry, they are used in many different ways, and can be the cadency mark of the sixth son. Additionally, it features in a large number of royal arms of the House of Plantagenet, from the 13th century onwards to the early Tudors (Elizabeth of York and the de la Pole family).The tressure flory\u2013counterflory (flowered border) has been a prominent part of the design of the Scottish royal arms and Royal Standard since James I of Scotland.\n\nIn Italy, fleurs-de-lis have been used for some papal crowns and coats of arms, the Farnese Dukes of Parma, and by some doges of Venice.The fleur-de-lis was also the symbol of the House of Kotromani\u0107, a ruling house in medieval Bosnia allegedly in recognition of the Capetian House of Anjou, where the flower is thought of as a Lilium bosniacum. Today, fleur-de-lis is a national symbol of Bosniaks.Other countries include Spain in recognition of rulers from the House of Bourbon. Coins minted in 14th-century Romania, from the region that was the Principality of Moldova at the time, ruled by Petru I Mu\u0219at, carry the fleur-de-lis symbol.As a dynastic emblem it has also been very widely used: not only by noble families but also, for example, by the Fuggers, a medieval banking family.\nThree fleurs-de-lis appeared in the personal coat of arms of Grandmaster Alof de Wignacourt who ruled the Malta between 1601 and 1622. His nephew Adrien de Wignacourt, who was Grandmaster himself from 1690 to 1697, also had a similar coat of arms with three fleurs-de-lis.\nThe heraldic fleur-de-lis is still widespread: among the numerous cities which use it as a symbol are some whose names echo the word 'lily', for example, Liljendal, Finland, and Lelystad, Netherlands. This is called canting arms in heraldic terminology. Other European examples of municipal coats-of-arms bearing the fleur-de-lis include Lincoln in England, Morc\u00edn in Spain, Wiesbaden and Darmstadt in Germany, Skierniewice in Poland and Jurbarkas in Lithuania. The Swiss municipality of Schlieren and the Estonian municipality of J\u00f5el\u00e4htme also have a fleur-de-lis on their coats.In Malta, the town of Santa Venera has three red fleurs-de-lis on its flag and coat of arms. These are derived from an arch which was part of the Wignacourt Aqueduct that had three sculpted fleurs-de-lis on top, as they were the heraldic symbols of Alof de Wignacourt, the Grand Master who financed its building. Another suburb which developed around the area became known as Fleur-de-Lys, and it also features a red fleur-de-lis on its flag and coat of arms.\n\nAlbania\nIn Albania, fleur-de-lys (alb: Lulja e Zambakut) has been always associated with the Noble House of Topia. After the Ottoman invasion of Albania, the symbol was removed by the Toptani family, a branch of the Topia Family.\n\nBelarus\nThe Belarusian Scouting and Guiding organization that, while preserving the traditions of the past, uses a fleur-de-lis as a symbol.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nThe golden lily is a traditional symbol of the Bosniak people. The coat of arms of the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia contained six fleurs-de-lis, understood as the native Bosnian or Golden Lily, Lilium bosniacum. This emblem was revived in 1992 as a national symbol of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and was the flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992 to 1998. The state insignia were changed in 1999. The former flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina contains a fleur-de-lis alongside the Croatian chequy. Fleurs also appear in the flags and arms of many cantons, municipalities, cities and towns. It is still used as official insignia of the Bosniak Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nCanada\nThe Royal Banner of France or \"Bourbon Flag\"  symbolizing royal France, was the most commonly used flag in New France. The  \"Bourbon Flag\" has three gold fleur-de-lis on a dark blue field arranged two and one. The fleur-de-lys was also seen on New France's currency often referred to as \"card money\". The white Royal Banner of France was used by the military of New France and was seen on naval vessels and forts of New France. After the fall of New France to the British Empire the fleur-de-lys remained visible on churches and remained part of French cultural symbolism. There are many French-speaking Canadians for whom the fleur-de-lis remains a symbol of their French cultural identity. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Franco-Ontarians, Franco-T\u00e9nois and Franco-Albertans, feature the fleur-de-lis prominently on their flags.\nThe Fleur-de-lys, as a traditional Royal symbol in Canada, has been incorporated into many national symbols, provincial symbols and\nmunicipal symbols, The Canadian Red Ensign that served as the nautical flag and civil ensign for Canada from 1892 to 1965 and later as an informal flag of Canada before 1965 featured the traditional number of three golden fleur-de-lys on a blue background. The Arms of Canada throughout its variations has used fleur-de-lys, beginning in 1921 and subsequent various has featuring the blue \"Bourbon Flag\" in two locations within arms. The Canadian Royal cypher and the Arms of Canada feature St Edward's Crown that displays five cross patt\u00e9e and four fleur-de-lys.  The fleur-de-lis is featured on the flag of Quebec, known as the Fleurdelis\u00e9, as well as the flags of the cities of Montreal, Sherbrooke and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\n\nItaly\nIn Italy, the fleur de lis - called giglio bottonato (it) - is mainly known from the crest of the city of Florence. In the Florentine fleurs-de-lis  the stamens are always posed between the petals. Originally argent (silver or white) on gules (red) background, the emblem became the standard of the imperial party in Florence (parte ghibellina), causing the town government, which maintained a staunch Guelph stance, being strongly opposed to the imperial pretensions on city states, to reverse the color pattern to the final gules lily on argent background. This heraldic charge is often known as the Florentine lily to distinguish it from the conventional (stamen-not-shown) design. As an emblem of the city, it is therefore found in icons of Zenobius, its first bishop, and associated with Florence's patron Saint John the Baptist in the Florentine fiorino. Several towns subjugated by Florence or founded within the territory of the Florentine Republic adopted a variation of the Florentine lily in their crests, often without the stamens.\n\nLithuania\nThe design of the arms of Jurbarkas is believed to originate from the arms of the Sapieha house, a Lithuanian noble family which was responsible for Jurbarkas receiving city rights and a coat of arms in 1611.The three fleurs-de-lis design on the Jurbarkas coat of arms was abolished during the final years of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, but officially restored in 1993 after the independence of present-day Lithuania was re-established. Before restoration, several variant designs, such as using one over two fleurs-de-lis, had been restored and abolished. The original two over one version was briefly readopted in 1970 during the Soviet occupation, but abolished that same year.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, a fleur-de-lis has appeared in the official arms of the Norroy King of Arms for hundreds of years. A silver fleur-de-lis on a blue background is the arms of the Barons Digby.In English and Canadian heraldry the fleur-de-lis is the cadence mark of a sixth son.It can also be found on the arms of the Scottish clan Chiefs of both Carruthers; Gules two engrailed chevrons between three fleur-d-lis Or and the Brouns\/Browns: Gules a chevron between three fleur d-lis Or.\n\nUnited States\nFleurs-de-lis crossed the Atlantic along with Europeans going to the New World, especially with French settlers. Their presence on North American flags and coats of arms usually recalls the involvement of French settlers in New France of the town or region concerned, and in some cases the persisting presence there of a population descended from such settlers.\n\nIn the US, the fleur-de-lis symbols tend to be along or near the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. These are areas of strong French colonial empire settlement. Some of the places that have it in their flag or seal are the cities of Baton Rouge, Detroit, Lafayette, Louisville, Mobile, New Orleans, Ocean Springs and St. Louis. On 9 July 2008, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal signed a bill into law making the fleur-de-lis an official symbol of the state. Following Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005, the fleur-de-lis has been widely used in New Orleans and throughout Louisiana, as a symbol of grassroots support for New Orleans' recovery. The coat of arms of St. Augustine, Florida has a fleur-de-lis on the first quarter, due to its connection with Huguenots. Several counties have flags and seals based on pre-1801 British royal arms also includes fleur-de-lis symbols. They are King George County, Virginia and Prince George's County, Somerset County, Kent County, and Montgomery County in Maryland.\nIt has also become the symbol for the identity of the Cajuns and Louisiana Creole people, and their French heritage.\n\nMilitary\nFleurs-de-lis are featured in military healdry. E.g., in the United States, the New Jersey Army National Guard unit 112th Field Artillery (Self Propelled)\u2014part of the much larger 42nd Infantry Division Mechanized\u2014which has it in the upper left side of their distinctive unit insignia; the U.S. Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment, 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment, 62nd Medical Brigade, 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team; and the Corps of Cadets at Louisiana State University.  The U.S. Air Force's Special Operations Weather Beret Flash also used a fleurs-de-lis in its design, carried over from its Vietnam War era Commando Weatherman Beret Flash. It is also featured by the Israeli Intelligence Corps, and the First World War Canadian Expeditionary Force. In the British Army, the fleur-de-lis was the cap badge of the Manchester Regiment from 1922 until 1958, and also its successor, the King's Regiment up to its amalgamation in 2006. It commemorates the capture of French regimental colours by their predecessors, the 63rd Regiment of Foot, during the Invasion of Martinique in 1759. It is also the formation sign of the 2nd (Independent) Armored Brigade of the Indian Army, known as the 7th Indian Cavalry Brigade in First World War, which received the emblem for its actions in France.\n\nIn religion and art\nIn the Middle Ages, the symbols of lily and fleur-de-lis overlapped considerably in Christian religious art. The historian Michel Pastoureau says that until about 1300 they were found in depictions of Jesus, but gradually they took on Marian symbolism and were associated with the Song of Solomon's \"lily among thorns\" (lilium inter spinas), understood as a reference to Mary. Other scripture and religious literature in which the lily symbolizes purity and chastity also helped establish the flower as an iconographic attribute of the Virgin. It was also believed that the fleur-de-lis represented the Holy Trinity.In medieval England, from the mid-12th century, a noblewoman's seal often showed the lady with a fleur-de-lis, drawing on the Marian connotations of \"female virtue and spirituality\". Images of Mary holding the flower first appeared in the 11th century on coins issued by cathedrals dedicated to her, and next on the seals of cathedral chapters, starting with Notre Dame de Paris in 1146. A standard portrayal was of Mary carrying the flower in her right hand, just as she is shown in that church's Virgin of Paris statue (with lily), and in the centre of the stained glass rose window (with fleur-de-lis sceptre) above its main entrance. The flowers may be \"simple fleurons, sometimes garden lilies, sometimes genuine heraldic fleurs-de-lis\". As attributes of the Madonna, they are often seen in pictures of the Annunciation, notably in those of Sandro Botticelli and Filippo Lippi. Lippi also uses both flowers in other related contexts: for instance, in his Madonna in the Forest.\nThe three petals of the heraldic design reflect a widespread association with the Holy Trinity, with the band on the bottom symbolizing Mary. The tradition says that without Mary you can not understand the Trinity since it was she who bore the Son. A tradition going back to 14th century France added onto the earlier belief that they also represented faith, wisdom and chivalry. Alternatively, the cord can be seen as representing the one Divine Substance (godhood) of the three Persons, which binds Them together.\n\"Flower of light\" symbolism has sometimes been understood from the archaic variant fleur-de-luce (see Latin lux, luc- = \"light\"), but the Oxford English Dictionary suggests this arose from the spelling, not from the etymology.\n\nSports\nThe fleur-de-lis is used by a number of sports teams, especially when it echoes a local flag. This is true with the teams from Quebec (Nordiques (ex-NHL), Montreal Expos (ex-MLB) and CF Montr\u00e9al (MLS)), the teams of New Orleans, Louisiana (Saints (NFL), Pelicans (NBA), and Zephyrs (PCL)), the Serie A team Fiorentina, the Bundesliga side SV Darmstadt 98 (also known as Die Lilien \u2013 The Lilies), the Rugby league team Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, the NPSL team Detroit City FC.Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury, a Canadian ice hockey goaltender, has a fleur-de-lis logo on his mask. The UFC Welterweight Champion from 2006 to 2013, Georges St-Pierre, has a tattoo of the fleur-de-lis on his right calf. The IT University of Copenhagen's soccer team ITU F.C. has it in their logo. France uses the symbol in the official emblem on the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nEducation\nThe emblem appears in coats of arms and logos for universities (like Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis University in Spain, University of Lincoln in England and University of Louisiana at Lafayette) and schools such as in Hilton College (South Africa), Adamson University and St. Paul's University in the Philippines. The Lady Knights of the University of Arkansas at Monticello have also adopted the fleur de lis as one of the symbols associated with their coat of arms. The flag of Lincolnshire, adopted in 2005, has a fleur-de-lis for the city of Lincoln. It is one of the symbols of the American sororities Kappa Kappa Gamma and Theta Phi Alpha, the American fraternities Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Alpha Mu, as well as the international co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. It is also used by the high school and college fraternity Scouts Royale Brotherhood of the Philippines.\n\nScouting\nThe fleur-de-lis is the main element in the logo of most Scouting organizations. The symbol was first used by Sir Robert Baden-Powell as an arm-badge for soldiers who qualified as scouts (reconnaissance specialists) in the 5th Dragoon Guards, which he commanded at the end of the 19th century; it was later used in cavalry regiments throughout the British Army until 1921. In 1907, Baden-Powell made brass fleur-de-lis badges for the boys attending his first experimental \"Boy Scout\" camp at Brownsea Island. In his seminal book Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell referred to the motif as \"the arrowhead which shows the North on a map or a compass\" and continued; \"It is the Badge of the Scout because it points in the right direction and upward... The three points remind you of the three points of the Scout Promise\", being duty to God and country, helping others, and keeping the Scout Law. The World Scout Emblem of the World Organization of the Scout Movement has elements which are used by most national Scout organizations. The stars stand for truth and knowledge, the encircling rope for unity, and its reef knot or square knot, service.\n\nOrganizations\nFleurs-de-lis appear on military insignia and the logos of many organisations. During the 20th century the symbol was adopted by various Scouting organisations worldwide for their badges. Architects and designers use it alone and as a repeated motif in a wide range of contexts, from ironwork to bookbinding, especially where a French context is implied.\n\nHealdic feature in architecture\nIn building and architecture, the fleur-de-lis is often placed on top of iron fence posts, as a pointed defence against intruders. It may ornament any tip, point or post with a decorative flourish, for instance, on finials, the arms of a cross, or the point of a gable. The fleur-de-lis can be incorporated in friezes or cornices, although the distinctions between fleur-de-lis, fleuron, and other stylized flowers are not always clear, or can be used as a motif in an all-over tiled pattern, perhaps on a floor.\nIt may appear in a building for heraldic reasons, as in some English churches where the design paid a compliment to a local lord who used the flower on his coat of arms. Elsewhere the effect seems purely visual, like the crenellations on the 14th-century Muslim Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan.\nIt can also be seen on the doors of the 16th-century Hindu Padmanabhaswamy Temple.\n\nDerived non-heraldic usage\nSome modern usage of the fleur-de-lis reflects \"the continuing presence of heraldry in everyday life\", often intentionally, but also when users are not aware that they are \"prolonging the life of centuries-old insignia and emblems\".\n\nThe symbol may be used in less traditional ways. After Hurricane Katrina many New Orleanians of varying ages and backgrounds were tattooed with \"one of its cultural emblems\" as a \"memorial\" of the storm, according to a researcher at Tulane University. The US Navy Blue Angels have named a looping flight demonstration manoeuvre after the flower as well, and there are even two surgical procedures called \"after the fleur.\"\nAmerican automobile manufacturer Chevrolet takes its name from the racing driver Louis Chevrolet, who was born in Switzerland.  But, because the Chevrolet name is French, the manufacturer has used the fleur-de-lis emblems on their cars, most notably the Corvette, but also as a small detail in the badges and emblems on the front of a variety of full-size Chevys from the 1950s, and 1960s.  The fleur-de-lis has also been featured more prominently in the emblems of the Caprice sedan.A fleur-de-lis also appears in some of the logos of local Louisiana media, such as WGNO-TV and WVUE-TV, the local ABC-affiliated and Fox-affiliated television stations in New Orleans respectively.\nThe fleur-de-lis is one of the objects to drop during the New Year's Eve celebrations in New Orleans, which was broadcast for the first time during Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve '17 with Ryan Seacrest.\nNew Orleans sludge metal band Crowbar use it as a logo. It's appeared on every album cover since Lifesblood for the Downtrodden and is sometimes incorporated into the artwork (on The Serpent Only Lies as a snake and on Sever the Wicked Hand as a sword's hilt). The Fleur-de-lis is also used decoratively on fire apparatus.\n\nCompass rose\nThe symbol is also often used on a compass rose to mark the north direction, a tradition started by the Portuguese cartographer Jorge de Aguiar in his chart of 1492.\n\nSlave branding\nIn Mauritius, slaves were branded with a fleur-de-lis, when being punished for escaping or stealing food.In France, some categories of outlaws were branded with a fleur de lys iron rod as a punishment for crimes involving a banishment sentence. In 1724, the punishment evolved in a system of letters brandings relative to the crime. The fleur de lys became an exclusive punishment for slaves in the colonies.\nThe fleur-de-lis (or flower de Luce) could be branded on slaves as punishment for certain offenses in French Louisiana.  For instance, the Louisiana Code Noir (1724) stated:\n\nXXXII. The runaway slave, who shall continue to be so for one month from the day of his being denounced to the officers of justice, shall have his ears cut off, and shall be branded with the flower de luce on the shoulder: and on a second offence of the same nature, persisted in during one month from the day of his being denounced, he shall be hamstrung, and be marked with the flower de luce on the other shoulder. On the third offence, he shall suffer death\".\nThe Code Noir was an arrangement of controls received in Louisiana in 1724 from other French settlements around the globe, intended to represent the state's slave populace. Those guidelines included marking slaves with the fleur-de-lis as discipline for fleeing.\n\nIn fiction\nThe symbol has featured in modern fiction on historical and mystical themes, as in the bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code and other books discussing the Priory of Sion. It recurs in French literature, where examples well known in English translation include Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier, a character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo, and the mention in Dumas's The Three Musketeers of the old custom of branding a criminal with the sign (fleurdeliser). During the reign of Elizabeth I of England, known as the Elizabethan era, it was a standard name for an iris, a usage which lasted for centuries, but occasionally refers to lilies or other flowers. It also appeared in the novel A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole on a sign composed by the protagonist.\n\nIn John Steinbeck's East of Eden, Cathy Ames (\"Kate\") wears a gold watch with a fleur-de-lis pin around her neck.A variation on the symbol has also been used in the Star Wars franchise to represent the planet of Naboo. The fleur de lis is also used as the heraldic emblem for the Kingdom of Temeria in Andrzej Sapkowski's fantasy novel series The Witcher.\nThe fleur de lis has also been used in the TV series The Originals, in which it is used to represent the Mikaelson family, the first vampires in the world. The symbol's representation of unity and its usage in New Orleans where the show is set, are used to represent the vow three of the Mikaelson siblings made to each other that they remain together, always and forever.\nThe fleur de lis is displayed in Champion, a cavalry unit that appears in Heroes of Might and Magic V: Tribes of the East, and is also a symbol adopted by the Sisters of Battle, a faction in Warhammer 40,000. A heavily stylized fleur de lis symbol can also be recognized as the symbol of the ICA in the Hitman series of video games.The Pok\u00e9mon villain Lysandre; whose debut game was Pok\u00e9mon X and Y is known in Japan as \u30d5\u30e9\u30c0\u30ea (Furadari); a romanised name for the fleur-de-lis. Relevant is that Pok\u00e9mon X and Y are inspired by France. Many locations and landmarks across Kalos have real-world inspirations, including Prism Tower (Eiffel Tower), the Lumiose Art Museum (the Louvre) and the stones outside Geosenge Town (Carnac stones).This symbol is also used as the icon for the fictional street gang \"Third Street Saints\" in the Saints Row series.\nThe symbol is also seen in the video games Gangstar: New Orleans and Persona 5, on Yusuke Kitagawa's shirt.\n\nSee also\nCross fleury\nFloral emblem\nArmorial of France\nThe Golden Lily (disambiguation)\nIris florentina\nIris pseudacorus\nJessant-de-lys\nLilium\nPalmette\nPrince of Wales's feathers\nShamrock\nScottish thistle\nTree of LifeUse of the lily in coinage and coat-of-arms in the Land of Israel\/PalestineAcre, Israel, where the Hospitaller refectory contains two early depictions of the French fleur-de-lis\nHasmonean coinage, coins minted during Hasmonean rule, sometimes depicting a lily\nYehud coinage, Achaemenid period coinage often depicting a lily\n\nExplanatory notes\nPassage 8:\nSazerac\nThe Sazerac is a local variation of a cognac or whiskey cocktail originally from New Orleans, named for the Sazerac de Forge et Fils brand of cognac brandy that served as its original main ingredient. The drink is most traditionally a combination of\ncognac or rye whiskey, absinthe, Peychaud's Bitters, and sugar, although bourbon whiskey is sometimes substituted for the rye and Herbsaint is sometimes substituted for the absinthe. Some claim it is the oldest known American cocktail, with origins in antebellum New Orleans, although drink historian David Wondrich is among those who dispute this, and American instances of published usage of the word cocktail to describe a mixture of spirits, bitters, and sugar can be traced to the dawn of the 19th century.\n\nCharacteristics\nThe defining feature of the Sazerac is its method of preparation, which commonly involves two chilled old-fashioned glasses. The first glass is swirled with a wash of absinthe for its flavor and strong scent. The second glass is used to combine the remaining ingredients, which are stirred with ice, then strained into the first glass. Various anisettes such as pastis, Pernod, or Herbsaint are common substitutes when absinthe is unavailable. In New Orleans, Herbsaint is most commonly used due to the absence of absinthe in the U.S. market from 1912 until 2007.\n\nHistory\nAround 1850, Sewell T. Taylor sold his New Orleans bar, the Merchants Exchange Coffee House, to become an importer of spirits, and he began to import a brand of cognac named Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils. Meanwhile, Aaron Bird assumed proprietorship of the Merchants Exchange and changed its name to Sazerac Coffee House. On October 2, 2019, the Sazerac House opened to the public as a museum and immersive experience that shares the history of the New Orleans cocktail culture, including the Sazerac.Legend has it that Bird began serving the \"Sazerac Cocktail\", made with Sazerac cognac imported by Taylor, and allegedly with bitters being made by the local apothecary, Antoine Amedie Peychaud. The Sazerac Coffee House subsequently changed hands several times, until around 1870 Thomas Handy became its proprietor. It is around this time that the primary ingredient changed from cognac to rye whiskey, due to the phylloxera epidemic in Europe that devastated the vineyards of France.At some point before his death in 1889, Handy recorded the recipe for the cocktail, which made its first printed appearance in William T. \"Cocktail Bill\" Boothby's The World's Drinks and How to Mix Them (1908), although his recipe calls for Selner Bitters, not Peychaud's. After absinthe was banned in the United States in 1912, it was replaced by various anise-flavored liqueurs, most notably the locally produced Herbsaint, which first appeared in 1934.By the early 20th century, simple cocktails like the Sazerac had become rare, which eventually rekindled their popularity.The creation of the Sazerac has also been credited to Antoine Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Peychaud, a Creole apothecary who emigrated to New Orleans from the West Indies and set up shop in the French Quarter in the early 19th century. He was known to dispense a proprietary mix of aromatic bitters from an old family recipe. \nAccording to popular myth, he served his drink in the large end of an egg cup that was called a coquetier in French, and the Americanized mispronunciation resulted in the name cocktail. This belief was debunked when people discovered that the term \"cocktail\" as a type of drink first appeared in print at least as far back as 1803\u2014and was defined in print in 1806 as, \"a mixture of spirits of any kind, water, sugar and bitters, vulgarly called a bittered sling\".\n\nOfficial cocktail of New Orleans\nIn March 2008, Louisiana state senator Edwin R. Murray (D-New Orleans) filed Senate Bill 6 designating the Sazerac as Louisiana's official state cocktail. The bill was defeated on April 8, 2008. After further debate, on June 23, 2008, the Louisiana Legislature agreed to proclaim the Sazerac as New Orleans' official cocktail.In 2011, as a writer for the HBO TV series Treme, Anthony Bourdain penned a scene in which chef Janette Desautel (played by Kim Dickens) tosses one in the face of restaurant critic and food writer Alan Richman (appearing as himself). Richman had angered many New Orleanians in 2006 with an article in the magazine GQ, in which he criticized New Orleans' food culture post-Hurricane Katrina. Despite reservations, he agreed to participate in the scene and called Sazerac \"a good choice of weaponry, because it symbolizes the city\", despite a running feud with Bourdain over, among other things, the review.\n\nSimilar cocktails\nA cocktail named the Zazarack was included in the 1910 version of Jack's Manual, an early bartender's reference written by Jacob \"Jack\" Grohusko, the head bartender at Baracca's restaurant in New York. It is essentially the same cocktail as the Sazerac, but called for bourbon (and not rye) instead of cognac.Later versions of the drink were spelled Zazarac and added rum, and are thought by some to be a variant of the Sazerac, although it might have originated completely independently of the more famous drink.\n\nBrands\nSazerac is also a brand of rye whiskey produced by the Sazerac Company.\n\nSee also\nList of cocktails\nOld Fashioned\nPassage 9:\nMarie Ragghianti\nMarie Fajardo Ragghianti (born June 13, 1942) is an American parole board administrator, famous as the whistleblower who exposed Tennessee Governor Ray Blanton's \"clemency for cash\" scandal in 1977-79.\nRagghianti grew up in Florida, where she was regarded as a beauty queen. She married a boxer, but her husband became an alcoholic. Their son nearly died from a lung infection at the age of two. They divorced, leaving Ragghianti with three young children.In 1971, at the age of 29, Ragghianti won a scholarship to Vanderbilt University, and earned a Bachelor of Science in English Literature and Psychology (1975). She was active in the Vanderbilt Young Democrats Club and caught the attention of newly elected governor Blanton's legal counsel, T. Edward \"Eddie\" Sisk. She was an extradition officer for the Tennessee Department of Correction (1975\u201376) and the chair of the Tennessee Board of Pardons and Paroles (1976\u201377).Ragghianti earned a M.S. in Management of Human Services in 1978 from Vanderbilt University, and a Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) from the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1992. She worked as a consultant to the Tennessee legislature in 1979. From 1979 through 1997, she worked as a criminal justice consultant. From 1997 through 1999, she worked as the chief of staff for the United States Parole Commission.Ragghianti was responsible for a federal investigation of corruption in the Tennessee parole and pardon process that led to the conviction of the governor and two aides, and was the subject of the 1985 movie Marie. Her attorney during the trial was Fred Thompson, who began his acting career portraying himself in the movie.\nRagghianti received the Goldsmith Award for journalism while attending the Kennedy School of Government and was a National Institute on Drug Abuse fellow while attending the graduate program in criminal justice at the University of Albany, SUNY.She was appointed a member of the U.S. Parole Commission National Appeals Board on December 9, 1999, by President Bill Clinton in a recess appointment. She was designated as the board's vice chairperson on January 6, 2000. Her appointment expired December 15, 2000 after no action on her nomination had been taken by the United States Senate.\nPassage 10:\nA\u00e9rodrome Saint-Louis\nThe A\u00e9rodrome Saint-Louis, also called A\u00e9rodrome du Bois Gomin or Canadian Transcontinental Airways Airport, was the first airfield of the Quebec City area of Quebec, Canada.

It is also known as Lazy Galahad, Strictly Dynamite and The Magnificent Jerk.\n\nPlot\nDwight Dawson runs a hype-driven self-improvement course in the Dale Carnegie mode. He and his partner Horace Hunter are seeking new sales ideas as enrollment has declined sharply. Their chief of marketing, Claire Harris, who is also Dwight's fianc\u00e9e, comes up with an idea to announce a contest seeking the biggest loser in the country. The prize is $500 and Dwight's course in career advancement. The idea is that the contest will create interest to Dwight's teaching system.\nA winner is chosen: Thadeus Winship Page from the small town of Upper White Eddy in Vermont. He is running a not overly successful business of renting out boats during summer time and is, by his own description, lazy and completely unmotivated.\nTad comes to New York City to collect his prize, determined to use the money toward a fire engine needed by the small town. The publicity stunt is jeopardized, though, when happy, contented Tad does not want to take the course. Tad is charmed by Claire during a night out in the city and falls in love with her, all the while expounding his own philosophies on relaxation, enjoying life, and the unimportance of money. After the night out, Tad reluctantly agrees to take the course, just to be close to Claire.\nClaire comes to realizes that he is not the failure they had thought him to be. After a while, Tad shyly admits to Claire that he is in love, but he doesn't dare tell her she is the subject of his affection, inventing a girl from his hometown named \"Hazel\".\nWhen Dwight hears about this, he tells Tad that the business course will help him in his quest to win his girl. Tad believes Dwight and continues the course until he hears that Claire is in love with someone else. Dwight and Horace have to persuade him once again to stay, telling Tad that the man Claire is in love with is an ugly, fat, and stupid man who can be out-conquered, carefully concealing his own engagement to Claire.\nThe publicity makes the course a success and attendance becomes much higher. Dwight convinces Tad to get a job to prove his success to the various magazines covering the course progress, so he does. He is hired as an insurance salesman, but is soon discouraged when he is unsuccessful. Dwight secretly helps out by making his friend buy an insurance policy from Tad, unaware that his friend, Frank Mitchell, has high blood pressure and would not pass the required physical. Tad commits his anticipated commission to the purchase of the fire engine, and takes Claire to see it. They bond further over Claire's passion for fire engines; she was a fire chief's niece.\nWhen Tad finally reveals to Claire that she is his \"Hazel\", she reveals her engagement to Dwight. Heartbroken and humiliated, Tad feels he has been played for a fool by the couple.\nThe next day, after dodging Claire's many phone calls, Tad uses a special relaxation technique on Frank to help him pass the necessary physical, then proceeds to Dwight's office to vent his anger.  Instead, he joins the rest of the office in overhearing a furious Claire in Dwight's office scolding him for the ruse and confessing her love for Tad. When Claire exits the building she finds Tad waiting in the new fire engine.  With the siren blaring, they drive off to Vermont together as a couple. Dwight moves on to teach relaxation, using the technique Tad showed him.\n\nCast\nHenry Fonda as Thadeus Winship \"Tad\" Page\nLynn Bari as Claire Harris\nDon Ameche as Dwight Dawson\nEdward Everett Horton as Horace Hunter\nGeorge Barbier as James Roger Barker\nFrank Orth as Messenger\nRoseanne Murray as Dawson's Secretary\nMarietta Canty as Jennie\nHobart Cavanaugh as Albert Gowdy\nHal K.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 7:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 8:\nRobert Day (director)\nRobert Frederick Day (11 September 1922 \u2013 17 March 2017) was an English film director. He directed more than 40 films between 1956 and 1991.\n\nBiography\nDay was born in Sheen, England. He worked his way up from clapper boy to camera operator then cinematographer while in his native country, and began directing in the mid-1950s. His first film as director, the black comedy The Green Man (1956) for the writer-producer team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, gained good reviews. Using this as a starting point, Day went on to become one of the industry's busiest directors including directing several Tarzan films.\nHe relocated to Hollywood in the 1960s and directed many TV episodes and made-for-TV movies. He occasionally had small parts in his own productions, including The Haunted Strangler (1958), Two-Way Stretch (1960), and the TV mini-series Peter and Paul (1981).\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Day would direct episodes of numerous American television shows, including Barnaby Jones, The F.B.I., Dallas, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, and Matlock.\n\nPersonal life\nDay was married to Eileen Day and then, following their divorce, to actress Dorothy Provine until her death in 2010. He was the brother of cinematographer Ernest Day.\nDay died at the age of 94 on Bainbridge Island near Seattle on 17 March 2017.\n\nSelected filmography\nPassage 9:\nTarzan the Magnificent\nTarzan the Magnificent is a 1960 British Eastmancolor film, the follow-up to Tarzan's Greatest Adventure (1959). Its plot bears no relation to that of the 1939 Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same name. The film was directed by Robert Day and produced by Sy Weintraub and Harvey Hayutin. Gordon Scott made his last appearance as Tarzan in the film, while Jock Mahoney appeared as villain Coy Banton. Mahoney would take over the Tarzan role himself beginning in the next film, Tarzan Goes to India, in 1962. The motion picture does not include Jane.\n\nPlot\nThe Bantons (father, Abel and four sons, Coy, Ethan, Johnny and Martin) rob a pay office in a settlement, killing some people. Coy Banton is tracked down to their camp and taken away by a policeman, Wyntors. Taking him back to town, Wyntors is killed as two of the brothers seek to rescue Coy. Tarzan appears and kills Ethan Banton. The other brother escapes. Tarzan decides to take Coy to Kairobi for the $5000 reward so he can give it to Wyntors' widow. However, no one in the town of Mantu (same town as the one at the beginning of Tarzan's Greatest Adventure) wants to help him. The boat he is waiting for to take him and his prisoner to Kairobi is ambushed by the Bantons, who send the passengers off and destroy the boat.\nLater that night Tarzan meets with the people from the boat and decides on an overland trek to take Coy Banton to Kairobi and agrees to take along, at first, the boat's mate, Tate, then reluctantly agrees to take the passengers of the boat: A business man named Ames and his wife, Fay; another man named Conway and a young woman named Lori, who all share with Tarzan their own reasons for wanting to go to Kairobi. But Tarzan warns them the trek through the jungles would be hard and dangerous. The presence of so many people to watch out for hinders Tarzan. The Bantons threaten to kill anyone who helps Tarzan. Pausing only to shoot the doctor who has told them what they want to know, the Bantons set out after the party and Coy.\nAmes is a boastful and racist windbag whose wife begins to detest him. Seeing this, Coy plays up to her, hoping he might be able to use her later. The party are captured by natives and the leader wants to kill Coy, who killed his brother when the Bantons raided their village. However, the chief's wife is having a difficult childbirth labour, and since Conway (who was a doctor) is able to help her have her baby (a breach birth), the chief agrees to let the party go.\nCoy sees his chance and escapes. Thanks to Ames, Tate is shot and later dies. Tarzan again captures Coy and he hides them both in a quicksand pit as the other Bantons search for them. Later, Lori wanders off and is caught by Johnny Banton who attempts to have his way with her. As she screams, Tarzan comes to rescue her and, after a fight, Johnny dies from a shot in the face with his rifle while struggling with Tarzan and falls into a stream. Later, seeing his grave (along with Tate's), Martin Banton has had enough of a father who taught them to steal and murder by age sixteen, and leaves him.\nCoy's wiles have paid off and Fay Ames releases him while the others sleep, and they leave camp together. Tarzan goes after them and finds Fay's scarf. Coy left her behind when she was out of breath and a lioness found her. Tarzan eventually comes on Coy and Abel Banton, and in a roving battle, a ricochet from Coy's rifle kills Abel. A prolonged battle on rocks, on sand and underwater follows before Tarzan finally knocks Coy out. The film ends with Tarzan and the remaining three people (Ames, Lori, and Conway) handing Coy over to the Kairobi police on the border and instructs Conway to make sure Wyntor's widow gets the reward money.\n\nCast\nGordon Scott as Tarzan\nJock Mahoney as Coy Banton\nBetta St. John as Fay Ames\nJohn Carradine as Abel Banton\nLionel Jeffries as Ames\nAlexandra Stewart as Lori\nEarl Cameron as Tate\nCharles Tingwell as Conway\nAl Mulock as Martin Banton\nGary Cockrell as Johnny Banton\nRon McDonnell as Ethan Banton\nHarry Baird as Warrior Leader\nChristopher Carlos as Native Chief\nJohn Sullivan as Inspector Wyntors\nEwen Solon as Dexter\nJacqueline Evans as Mrs Dexter\nThomas Duggan as Frye\nPeter Howell as Dr Blake\nJohn Harrison as N'Como\nGeorge Taylor as Captain Hayes\n\nProduction\nFilming started 25 January 1960 in Africa.\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1960\nPassage 10:\nSr\u0111an Karanovi\u0107\nSr\u0111an Karanovi\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0421\u0440\u0452\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b, pronounced [\u02ccs\u0159\u0329d\u035c\u0291an ka\u02c8r\u01ce\u02d0no\u028bit\u035c\u0255], born 17 November 1945) is a Serbian film director and screenwriter.

{"context":"Introduction\nIn the age of information dissemination without quality control, it has enabled malicious users to spread misinformation via social media and aim individual users with propaganda campaigns to achieve political and financial gains as well as advance a specific agenda. Often disinformation is complied in the two major forms: fake news and propaganda, where they differ in the sense that the propaganda is possibly built upon true information (e.g., biased, loaded language, repetition, etc.).\nPrior works BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2 in detecting propaganda have focused primarily at document level, typically labeling all articles from a propagandistic news outlet as propaganda and thus, often non-propagandistic articles from the outlet are mislabeled. To this end, EMNLP19DaSanMartino focuses on analyzing the use of propaganda and detecting specific propagandistic techniques in news articles at sentence and fragment level, respectively and thus, promotes explainable AI. For instance, the following text is a propaganda of type `slogan'.\nTrump tweeted: $\\underbrace{\\text{`}`{\\texttt {BUILD THE WALL!}\"}}_{\\text{slogan}}$\nShared Task: This work addresses the two tasks in propaganda detection BIBREF3 of different granularities: (1) Sentence-level Classification (SLC), a binary classification that predicts whether a sentence contains at least one propaganda technique, and (2) Fragment-level Classification (FLC), a token-level (multi-label) classification that identifies both the spans and the type of propaganda technique(s).\nContributions: (1) To address SLC, we design an ensemble of different classifiers based on Logistic Regression, CNN and BERT, and leverage transfer learning benefits using the pre-trained embeddings\/models from FastText and BERT. We also employed different features such as linguistic (sentiment, readability, emotion, part-of-speech and named entity tags, etc.), layout, topics, etc. (2) To address FLC, we design a multi-task neural sequence tagger based on LSTM-CRF and linguistic features to jointly detect propagandistic fragments and its type. Moreover, we investigate performing FLC and SLC jointly in a multi-granularity network based on LSTM-CRF and BERT. (3) Our system (MIC-CIS) is ranked 3rd (out of 12 participants) and 4th (out of 25 participants) in FLC and SLC tasks, respectively.\nSystem Description ::: Linguistic, Layout and Topical Features\nSome of the propaganda techniques BIBREF3 involve word and phrases that express strong emotional implications, exaggeration, minimization, doubt, national feeling, labeling , stereotyping, etc. This inspires us in extracting different features (Table TABREF1) including the complexity of text, sentiment, emotion, lexical (POS, NER, etc.), layout, etc. To further investigate, we use topical features (e.g., document-topic proportion) BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6 at sentence and document levels in order to determine irrelevant themes, if introduced to the issue being discussed (e.g., Red Herring).\nFor word and sentence representations, we use pre-trained vectors from FastText BIBREF7 and BERT BIBREF8.\nSystem Description ::: Sentence-level Propaganda Detection\nFigure FIGREF2 (left) describes the three components of our system for SLC task: features, classifiers and ensemble. The arrows from features-to-classifier indicate that we investigate linguistic, layout and topical features in the two binary classifiers: LogisticRegression and CNN. For CNN, we follow the architecture of DBLP:conf\/emnlp\/Kim14 for sentence-level classification, initializing the word vectors by FastText or BERT. We concatenate features in the last hidden layer before classification.\nOne of our strong classifiers includes BERT that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple NLP benchmarks. Following DBLP:conf\/naacl\/DevlinCLT19, we fine-tune BERT for binary classification, initializing with a pre-trained model (i.e., BERT-base, Cased). Additionally, we apply a decision function such that a sentence is tagged as propaganda if prediction probability of the classifier is greater than a threshold ($\\tau $). We relax the binary decision boundary to boost recall, similar to pankajgupta:CrossRE2019.\nEnsemble of Logistic Regression, CNN and BERT: In the final component, we collect predictions (i.e., propaganda label) for each sentence from the three ($\\mathcal {M}=3$) classifiers and thus, obtain $\\mathcal {M}$ number of predictions for each sentence. We explore two ensemble strategies (Table TABREF1): majority-voting and relax-voting to boost precision and recall, respectively.\nSystem Description ::: Fragment-level Propaganda Detection\nFigure FIGREF2 (right) describes our system for FLC task, where we design sequence taggers BIBREF9, BIBREF10 in three modes: (1) LSTM-CRF BIBREF11 with word embeddings ($w\\_e$) and character embeddings $c\\_e$, token-level features ($t\\_f$) such as polarity, POS, NER, etc. (2) LSTM-CRF+Multi-grain that jointly performs FLC and SLC with FastTextWordEmb and BERTSentEmb, respectively. Here, we add binary sentence classification loss to sequence tagging weighted by a factor of $\\alpha $. (3) LSTM-CRF+Multi-task that performs propagandistic span\/fragment detection (PFD) and FLC (fragment detection + 19-way classification).\nEnsemble of Multi-grain, Multi-task LSTM-CRF with BERT: Here, we build an ensemble by considering propagandistic fragments (and its type) from each of the sequence taggers. In doing so, we first perform majority voting at the fragment level for the fragment where their spans exactly overlap. In case of non-overlapping fragments, we consider all. However, when the spans overlap (though with the same label), we consider the fragment with the largest span.\nExperiments and Evaluation\nData: While the SLC task is binary, the FLC consists of 18 propaganda techniques BIBREF3. We split (80-20%) the annotated corpus into 5-folds and 3-folds for SLC and FLC tasks, respectively. The development set of each the folds is represented by dev (internal); however, the un-annotated corpus used in leaderboard comparisons by dev (external). We remove empty and single token sentences after tokenization. Experimental Setup: We use PyTorch framework for the pre-trained BERT model (Bert-base-cased), fine-tuned for SLC task. In the multi-granularity loss, we set $\\alpha = 0.1$ for sentence classification based on dev (internal, fold1) scores. We use BIO tagging scheme of NER in FLC task. For CNN, we follow DBLP:conf\/emnlp\/Kim14 with filter-sizes of [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 128 filters and 16 batch-size. We compute binary-F1and macro-F1 BIBREF12 in SLC and FLC, respectively on dev (internal).\nExperiments and Evaluation ::: Results: Sentence-Level Propaganda\nTable TABREF10 shows the scores on dev (internal and external) for SLC task. Observe that the pre-trained embeddings (FastText or BERT) outperform TF-IDF vector representation. In row r2, we apply logistic regression classifier with BERTSentEmb that leads to improved scores over FastTextSentEmb. Subsequently, we augment the sentence vector with additional features that improves F1 on dev (external), however not dev (internal). Next, we initialize CNN by FastTextWordEmb or BERTWordEmb and augment the last hidden layer (before classification) with BERTSentEmb and feature vectors, leading to gains in F1 for both the dev sets. Further, we fine-tune BERT and apply different thresholds in relaxing the decision boundary, where $\\tau \\ge 0.35$ is found optimal.\nWe choose the three different models in the ensemble: Logistic Regression, CNN and BERT on fold1 and subsequently an ensemble+ of r3, r6 and r12 from each fold1-5 (i.e., 15 models) to obtain predictions for dev (external). We investigate different ensemble schemes (r17-r19), where we observe that the relax-voting improves recall and therefore, the higher F1 (i.e., 0.673). In postprocess step, we check for repetition propaganda technique by computing cosine similarity between the current sentence and its preceding $w=10$ sentence vectors (i.e., BERTSentEmb) in the document. If the cosine-similarity is greater than $\\lambda \\in \\lbrace .99, .95\\rbrace $, then the current sentence is labeled as propaganda due to repetition. Comparing r19 and r21, we observe a gain in recall, however an overall decrease in F1 applying postprocess.\nFinally, we use the configuration of r19 on the test set. The ensemble+ of (r4, r7 r12) was analyzed after test submission. Table TABREF9 (SLC) shows that our submission is ranked at 4th position.\nExperiments and Evaluation ::: Results: Fragment-Level Propaganda\nTable TABREF11 shows the scores on dev (internal and external) for FLC task. Observe that the features (i.e., polarity, POS and NER in row II) when introduced in LSTM-CRF improves F1. We run multi-grained LSTM-CRF without BERTSentEmb (i.e., row III) and with it (i.e., row IV), where the latter improves scores on dev (internal), however not on dev (external). Finally, we perform multi-tasking with another auxiliary task of PFD. Given the scores on dev (internal and external) using different configurations (rows I-V), it is difficult to infer the optimal configuration. Thus, we choose the two best configurations (II and IV) on dev (internal) set and build an ensemble+ of predictions (discussed in section SECREF6), leading to a boost in recall and thus an improved F1 on dev (external).\nFinally, we use the ensemble+ of (II and IV) from each of the folds 1-3, i.e., $|{\\mathcal {M}}|=6$ models to obtain predictions on test. Table TABREF9 (FLC) shows that our submission is ranked at 3rd position.\nConclusion and Future Work\nOur system (Team: MIC-CIS) explores different neural architectures (CNN, BERT and LSTM-CRF) with linguistic, layout and topical features to address the tasks of fine-grained propaganda detection. We have demonstrated gains in performance due to the features, ensemble schemes, multi-tasking and multi-granularity architectures. Compared to the other participating systems, our submissions are ranked 3rd and 4th in FLC and SLC tasks, respectively.\nIn future, we would like to enrich BERT models with linguistic, layout and topical features during their fine-tuning. Further, we would also be interested in understanding and analyzing the neural network learning, i.e., extracting salient fragments (or key-phrases) in the sentence that generate propaganda, similar to pankajgupta:2018LISA in order to promote explainable AI.","label":"longbench","length":2376,"title":"Introduction"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nAlex Cox\nAlexander B. H. Cox (born 15 December 1954) is an English film director, screenwriter, actor, non-fiction author and broadcaster. Cox experienced success early in his career with Repo Man and Sid and Nancy, but since the release and commercial failure of Walker, his career has moved towards independent films. Cox received a co-writer credit for the screenplay of Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) for previous work on the script before it was rewritten by Gilliam.\nAs of 2012, Cox has taught screenwriting and film production at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nEarly life\nCox was born in Bebington, Cheshire, England in 1954. He attended Worcester College, Oxford, and later transferred to the University of Bristol where he majored in film studies. Cox secured a Fulbright Scholarship, allowing him to study at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he graduated from the School of Theater, Film and Television with an MFA.\n\nFilm career\nStudy and independent\nCox began reading law as an undergraduate at Oxford University, but left to study radio, film and TV at Bristol University, graduating in 1977. Seeing difficulties in the British film scene at the time, he first went to Los Angeles to attend film school at UCLA in 1977. There he produced his first film, Edge City (also known as Sleep Is for Sissies), a 40-minute surreal short about an artist struggling against society. After graduation, Cox formed Edge City Productions with two friends with the intention of producing low-budget feature films. He wrote a screenplay for Repo Man, which he hoped to produce for a budget of $70,000, and began seeking funding.\n\nHollywood and major studio period (1978\u20131987)\nMichael Nesmith agreed to produce Repo Man, and convinced Universal Studios to back the project with a budget of over a million dollars. During the course of the film's production, the studio's management changed, and the new management had far less faith in the project. The initial cinema release was limited to Chicago, followed by Los Angeles, and was short-lived.\nAfter the success of the soundtrack album (notable for featuring many popular LA punk bands), there was enough interest in the film to earn a re-release in a single cinema in New York City, but only after becoming available on video and cable. Nevertheless, it ran for 18 months, and eventually earned $4,000,000.\nContinuing his fascination with punk music, Cox's next film was an independent feature shot in London and Los Angeles, following the career and death of bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen, initially titled Love Kills and later renamed Sid and Nancy. It was met warmly by critics and fans, though heavily criticised by some, including Pistols' frontman John Lydon, for its inaccuracies. The production of this film also sparked a relationship with Joe Strummer of the Clash, who would continue to collaborate with the director on his next two films.\nCox had long been interested in Nicaragua and the Sandinistas (both Repo Man and Edge City made references to Nicaragua and\/or Latin American revolution), and visited in 1984. The following year, he hoped to shoot a concert film there featuring the Clash, the Pogues and Elvis Costello. When he could not get backing, he decided instead to write a film that they would all act in. The film became Straight to Hell. Collaborating with Dick Rude (who also co-starred beside Strummer, Sy Richardson and Courtney Love), he imagined the film as a spoof of the Spaghetti Western genre, filmed in Almer\u00eda, Spain, where many classic Italian westerns were shot. Straight to Hell was widely panned critically, but successful in Japan and retains a cult following. On 1 June 2012, Cox wrote an article in The New York Times about his long-standing interest in spaghetti westerns.Continuing his interest in Nicaragua, Cox took on a more overtly political project, with the intention of filming it there. He asked Rudy Wurlitzer to pen the screenplay, which followed the life of William Walker, set against a backdrop of anachronisms that drew parallels between the story and modern American intervention in the area. The $6,000,000 production was backed by Universal, but the completed film was too political and too violent for the studio's tastes, and the film went without promotion. When Walker failed to perform at the box office, it ended the director's involvement with Hollywood studios, and led to a period of several years in which Cox would not direct a single film. Despite this, Cox and some critics maintain that it is his best film.\n\nMexican period (1988\u20131996)\nEffectively blacklisted for working on a studio project during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, Alex Cox struggled to find feature work. He finally got financial backing for a feature from investors in Japan, where his films had been successful on video. Cox had scouted locations in Mexico during the pre-production of Walker and decided he wanted to shoot a film there, with a local cast and crew, in Spanish. Producer Lorenzo O'Brien penned the script. Inspired by the style of Mexican directors including Arturo Ripstein, he shot most of the film in plano secuencia; long, continuous takes shot with a hand-held camera. El Patrullero was completed and released in 1991, but struggled to find its way into cinemas.\nShortly after this, Cox was invited to adapt a Jorge Luis Borges story of his choice for the BBC. He chose Death and the Compass. Despite being a British production and an English language film, he convinced his producers to let him shoot in Mexico City. This film, like his previous Mexican production, made extensive use of long-takes. The completed 55-minute film aired on the BBC in 1992.\nCox had hoped to expand this into a feature-length film, but the BBC was uninterested. Japanese investors gave him $100,000 to expand the film in 1993, but the production ran over-budget, allowing no funds for post-production. To secure funds, Cox directed a \"work for hire\" project called The Winner. The film was edited extensively without Cox's knowledge, and he tried to have his name removed from the credits as a result but was denied, but the money was enough for Cox to fund the completion of Death and the Compass. The finished, 82-minute feature received a limited cinema release in the US, where the TV version had not aired, in 1996.\n\nLiverpool period (1997\u20132006)\nIn 1996, producer Stephen Nemeth employed Alex Cox to write and direct an adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. After creative disagreements with the producer and Thompson, he was sacked from the project, and his script rewritten when Terry Gilliam took over the film. (Cox later sued successfully for a writing credit, as it was ruled that there were enough similarities between the drafts to suggest that Gilliam's was derivative of Cox's. Gilliam countered that the screenplays were based on the source book and similarities between them were a consequence of this.)\nIn 1997, Alex Cox made a deal with Dutch producer Wim Kayzer to produce another dual TV\/feature production. Three Businessmen. Initially, Cox had hoped to shoot in Mexico but later decided to set his story in Liverpool, Rotterdam, Tokyo and Almer\u00eda. The story follows businessmen in Liverpool who leave their hotel in search of food and slowly drift further from their starting point, all the while believing they are still in Liverpool. The film was completed for a small budget of $250,000. Following this, Cox moved back to Liverpool and became interested in creating films there.\nCox had long been interested in the Jacobean play, The Revenger's Tragedy, and upon moving back to Britain, decided to pursue adapting it to a film. Collaborating with fellow Liverpudlian screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce, the story was recast in the near future, following an unseen war. This adaptation, titled Revengers Tragedy, consisted primarily of the original play's dialogue, with some additional bits written in a more modern tone. The film is also notable for its soundtrack, composed by Chumbawamba.\nFollowing this, Cox directed a short film set in Liverpool for the BBC titled I'm a Juvenile Delinquent \u2013 Jail Me! (2004). The 30-minute film satirised reality television as well as the high volume of petty crime in Liverpool which, according to Cox, is largely recreational.\n\nMicrofeature period (2007\u2013present)\nIn 2006, Alex Cox tried to get funding for a series of eight very low budget features set in Liverpool and produced by locals. The project was not completed, but the director grew interested in pursuing the idea of a film made for less than \u00a3100,000. He had originally hoped to shoot Repo Man on a comparable budget, and hoped that the lower overhead would mean greater creative freedom.\nSearchers 2.0, named after but based on The Searchers, became Cox's first film for which he has sole writing credit since Repo Man, and marked his return to the comedy genre. A road movie and a revenge story, it tells of two actors, loosely based on and played by Del Zamora and Ed Pansullo, who travel from Los Angeles to a desert film screening in Monument Valley in the hopes of avenging abuse inflicted on them by a cruel screenwriter, Fritz Frobisher (Sy Richardson). It was scored by longtime collaborator Dan Wool aka Pray for Rain (Sid & Nancy, Straight to Hell, Death & the Compass, The Winner, Three Businessmen, Repo Chick among others). Although the film was unable to achieve a cinema release in America or Europe, Cox claimed the experience of making a film with a smaller crew and less restrictions was energising. It is available on DVD in Japan, and was released in October 2010 in North America.Alex Cox had attempted to get a Repo Man sequel, titled Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday, produced in the mid-'90s, but the project fell apart, with the script adapted into a graphic novel of the same name. For his next micro-feature, he wrote a fresh attempt at a Repo follow-up, although it contained no recurring characters, so as to preserve Universal's rights to the original. Repo Chick was filmed entirely against a green screen, with backgrounds of digital composites, live action shots, and miniatures matted in afterwards, to produce an artificial look. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival on 9 September 2009.\nAs of July 2012, Cox was teaching film production and screenwriting at the University of Colorado at Boulder.In 2013 Cox directed Bill, the Galactic Hero, developed from a science fiction book by Harry Harrison. It was funded by a successful Kickstarter funding campaign, raising $114,957 of the original $100,000 goal. The film was to be made, created and acted by his film students in monochrome with supervision from professional film makers who would be giving their time on the film for free.Cox's 2013 book The President and the Provocateur examines events in the lives of John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald leading up to Kennedy's assassination, with reference to the various conspiracy theories.In 2017 Cox directed another crowdfunded film, Tombstone Rashomon, which tells the tale of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral from multiple perspectives in the style of Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film Rashomon.In September 2019, Cox started the podcast \u2018Conversations with Cox and Kj\u00f8lseth\u2019 with his friend and colleague Pablo Kj\u00f8lseth. In October 2022, Cox announced the end of the podcast, citing its small audience and the comparative success of podcasts by Joe Dante, Quentin Tarantino and Cox's one-time collaborator Roger Deakins.\n\nMoviedrome\nIn May 1988 Cox began presenting the long-running and influential BBC series Moviedrome. The weekly strand was a showcase for cult films. Though most of the films shown were chosen by series creator and producer Nick Jones, each film was introduced by Cox. By the time he left the show in September 1994, Cox had introduced 141 films. Various film directors have cited Moviedrome as an influence, including Ben Wheatley and Edgar Wright. The series was later presented by film director and critic Mark Cousins.\n\nInfluences and style\nCox has cited Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Akira Kurosawa as influences, as well as the Western film directors Sergio Leone, Sergio Corbucci, Sam Peckinpah, John Ford and Giulio Questi. Cox also wrote a book on the history of the genre called 10,000 Ways to Die. While he once directed films for Universal Pictures, such as Repo Man and Walker, since the late 1980s, he has found himself on a self-described blacklist, and turned to producing independent films. Cox is an atheist and is decidedly left-wing in his political views. Many of his films have an explicit anti-capitalist theme or message. He was originally set to direct Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but was replaced by Terry Gilliam due to creative differences with Hunter S. Thompson. By August 2009, Cox had announced completion of Repo Chick, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival the following month, but he remained ambivalent as to whether the film would ever be distributed to cinemas. His previous film, Searchers 2.0, was not released theatrically, and only appears on DVD in Japan and North America after a televised screening in the UK on the BBC.\nCox is a fan of the Japanese Godzilla films and appeared in a 1998 BBC documentary highlighting the series. He also narrated the documentary Bringing Godzilla Down to Size and wrote the Godzilla in Time comics for Dark Horse. He tried to direct an American Godzilla film at one point, but unsuccessfully submitted his outline to TriStar Pictures.\n\nPersonal life\nAs of 2011, Cox resided in Colestin, Oregon with his wife, writer Todelina Babish Davies.\n\nPartial list of works\nFeature films\nDocumentaries\nKurosawa: The Last Emperor (1999)\nEmmanuelle: A Hard Look (2000)\nBringing Godzilla Down to Size (2007) \u2013 narrator\nScene Missing (2012)\n\nTelevision\nMoviedrome (as presenter) (1988 to 1994)\nGodzilla: King of the Monsters \u2013 BBC, contributor\nIn His Life: The John Lennon Story as Bruno Koschmider\nMike Hama Must Die!

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia. He and his wife Celia had a son and two daughters.\nPassage 3:\nWaiting for the Clouds\nWaiting for the Clouds (Bulutlar\u0131 Beklerken) is a film from 2003, Turkey. The film was directed by Ye\u015fim Ustao\u011flu. It is based on a novel by Georgios Andreadis titled Tamama. The film was produced by Setarh Farsi, Helge Albers and Behrooz Hashemian. The film was nominated in Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival 2004.\n\nPlot\nThe neighbor\u00b4s son Mehmet is worried about the elderly woman Ayshe, and he likes hearing her stories. When Ayshe\u00b4s older sister dies she refuses to be with the other villager and starts searching for her younger brother in Greece. Waiting for the Clouds takes place in 1975 and Mehmet\u00b4s experience is based on the directors memory from the 70s. And the character Ayshe would not have had to keep her ethnic identity a secret for 50 years if she had lived in a tolerant environment.\n\nHiding ethnic identity\nThe character of Ayshe was born Eleni, daughter of indigenous Greeks in the eastern Black Sea region of Northern Turkey, what was once the ancient country of Pontus. She was adopted by a Turkish Muslim family in the World War I. Fear is the reason that Ayshe never spoke of her ethnic past again. In the 70s Turkey the government did put a lot of pressure on the ordinary lives.  If there had been tolerance, Ayshe would not have had to keep her ethnic identity a secret for 50 years. But in 1970s Turkey, paranoia and a fear of \u201cothers\u201d was on the rise while tolerance toward minority ethnic groups diminished.\n\nBoundaries and Ties\nThe movie has many commonalities with a series of movies by the renowned film maker Theodoros Angelopoulos: the borders and their impact on the lives of human beings \u2013 as in The Suspended Step of the Stork; a tedious Odyssean search for a family member \u2013 as in Landscape in the Mist; the long-lost identity and the fusion of different cultures \u2013 as in Ulysses' Gaze and The Suspended Step of the Stork. The similarities are not limited to the content and themes; they also include the form and style of the movie: carefully composed scenes and an enormous number of extended long shots. But there are telling differences as well. In Waiting for the Clouds, Ustaoglu tends to emphasize on the idea of distance, whereas Angelopolous emphasizes on the journey. We barely see Ayshe on the journey; rather, we see her at two different destinations. She belongs to a generation which has gone through the ordeal of Population exchange between Greece and Turkey, and has never managed  to fully recover from that emotional wound. When she finally decides to overcome her fears and inhibitions and go to find her lost brother, she trespasses a number of boundaries. We don\u2019t see her cross the physical boundary, the border, \u2013 unlike Angelopolous \u2013 but her crossing the imagined boundaries that she had created for herself is manifest. \u201cThe objective properties of the community are less important than the imagined ones.\u201d Deep in her subconscious, she imagines herself belonging to another nation, another community, and another language. But when she ventures outside her little home in the small village, she gets to see that what she had imagined to be her true community, is as strange to her as it gets. She goes back to Turkey, but she is not the same person anymore. She seems like she has put a huge burden off her shoulder. She begins to smile.\nPassage 4:\nHassan Zee\nHassan \"Doctor\" Zee is a Pakistani-American film director who was born in Chakwal, Pakistan.\n\nEarly life\nDoctor Zee grew up in Chakwal, a small village in Punjab, Pakistan. as one of seven brothers and sisters  His father was in the military and this fact required the family to move often to different cities.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 8:\nSouth of the Clouds (2004 film)\nSouth of the Clouds is a 2004 Chinese film and the second film directed by the writer Zhu Wen. The film stands in stark contrast to Zhu's previous film. In terms of production, South of the Clouds received the cooperation of the state apparatus unlike 2001's Seafood which was an underground production shot on digital hand-held cameras. In terms of story, the transgressive tale of a prostitute and a policeman in Seafood is a far cry from South of the Cloud's gentle tale of a retiree who fulfills a lifelong desire to travel to the southern province of Yunnan (literally \"South of the Clouds\").\nSouth of the Clouds stars Li Xuejian as the protagonist, Xu Daqin, and features a cameo by director Tian Zhuangzhuang as the police chief in a small town in Yunnan. It was produced by China Film Assist, an independent production company in China; South of the Clouds was the company's first production.\n\nBackground\nSouth of the Clouds was, at heart, an attempt by Zhu Wen to capture the image and beauty of Yunnan that he had experienced upon his first visit to the province. Beyond that, however, the film was an opportunity for Zhu to present his work to his home country. Following the completion of Seafood, Zhu \"wanted to make something that [he] could show to [his] parents and...friends in China. Unlike Seafood, South of the Clouds did not encounter any issues with the state censors, in part because the film strictly followed all the relevant regulations.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSouth of the Clouds like many Chinese art films was screened at numerous film festivals around the world. It succeeded in winning a FIPRESCI prize and the Firebird Award for New Cinema at the 28th Hong Kong International Film Festival. The film also won a NETPAC award at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2004.\n\nSee also\nMosuo - a matriarchal ethnic enclave in Yunnan, featured prominently in the film.\nPassage 9:\nYe\u015fim Ustao\u011flu\nYe\u015fim Ustao\u011flu (born 18 November 1960) is a Turkish filmmaker and screenwriter.\n\nLife and career\nUstao\u011flu was born in Kars, Sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f and grew up in Trabzon on the Black Sea.

This time he used an Indiegogo campaign.In an interview with IndieWire, Cox stated, \"I was thinking it would be a conventional western, but Rudy (Wurlitzer) wants to give it a science fiction angle \u2014 from the perspective of time-traveling women historians from the future. They\u2019ll time-travel back in time to film at the OK Corral, but they get the day wrong and they miss it by a day, so they have to interview the survivors.\" Wurlitzer was involved in early stages, but not credited as a writer on the final film, the screenplay is solely credited to Cox.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Cox stated that he had originally planned to film in Boulder, Colorado, but then decided to shoot in Tucson instead.Filming took place at the Old Tucson Studios west of Tucson. In an interview with Tucson Weekly, Cox stated that the producers of Snowden matched the funds already accumulated, helping Cox to complete the film.\n\nRelease\nThe film screened as a work in progress at the Ashland Independent Film Festival at 6:40 p.m. on Saturday, April 8, 2017, at the Cinedelphia Film Festival at 7:00 p.m. on April 15, 2017, and at the Loft Film Fest on May 27, 2017.","label":"longbench","length":7847,"title":"Passage 1:"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nHenry de Bohun\nSir Henry de Bohun (died 23 June 1314) was an English knight, of Anglo-Norman origins, the grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. He was killed on the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn by Robert the Bruce.\nRiding in the vanguard of heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of the Scottish king who was mounted on a small palfrey (ane gay palfray Li till and joly) armed only with a battle-axe.De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, but Bruce stood his ground, riding on towards the English knight. The two men sped towards each other (Sprent thai samyn intill a ling). At the last moment Bruce manoeuvred his mount nimbly to one side, stood up in his stirrups and hit de Bohun so hard with his axe that it cut through both Sir Henry's helmet and skull and into his brain (That ner the heid till the harnys clave). Despite the great risk the King had taken, he merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe.An iconic description and picture of the death of Henry de Bohun is contained in Scotland's Story by H. E. Marshall.\nPassage 2:\nEleanor de Bohun\nEleanor de Bohun (c.\u20091366 \u2013 3 October 1399) was the elder daughter and co-heiress (with her sister, Mary de Bohun), of  Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341\u20131373) and Joan Fitzalan, a daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and his second wife Eleanor of Lancaster.\n\nMarriage\nIn 1376, Eleanor married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester. Thomas was the youngest son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. Following their marriage, the couple went to reside in Pleshey Castle, Essex. According to Jean Froissart, Eleanor and her husband had the tutelage of her younger sister, Mary, who was being instructed in religious doctrine in the hope that she would enter a convent, thus leaving her share of the considerable Bohun inheritance to Eleanor and Thomas.\n\nIssue\nTogether Eleanor and Thomas had five children:\n\nHumphrey, 2nd Earl of Buckingham (c. 1381\/1382 \u2013 2 September 1399)\nAnne of Gloucester (c. 1383 \u2013 1438) married (1st) Thomas Stafford, 3rd Earl of Stafford; (2nd) Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford; and (3rd) William Bourchier, Count of Eu. Her son by 3rd marriage, John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners, was grandfather of Richard Neville, 2nd Baron Latimer of Snape.\nJoan (1384 \u2013 16 August 1400) married Gilbert Talbot, 5th Baron Talbot (1383\u20131419). Died in childbirth.\nIsabel (12 March 1385\/1386 \u2013 April 1402), became a Minoress, later abbess, in a religious house near Aldgate\nPhilippa (c. 1388) Died young\n\nOrder of the Garter\nEleanor de Bohun was made a Lady of the Garter in 1384. She became a nun sometime after 1397 at Barking Abbey. Prior to her death, Eleanor divided her holdings among her children.  She died on 3 October 1399 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Her executors included the chaplain in Pleshy, Essex.\n\nIn fiction\nEleanor appears briefly in Anya Seton's historical romance Katherine, based upon the life of Eleanor's sister-in-law Katherine Swynford, the third wife of John of Gaunt. She also appears in Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare's Richard II, where she unsuccessfully urges John of Gaunt to avenge her murdered husband.\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nJohn de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley\nJohn de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley (20 June 1271 Cardiff \u2013 1312) was the son of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby and Alianore de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun and Eleanor de Braose, and granddaughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. He was both Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of Aquitaine in 1312, the year of his death.Ferrers joined the baronial opposition to King Edward in 1297, but was summoned as a baron in 1299.He married Hawise de Muscegros, a daughter of Robert de Muscegros.Their eldest son John (died by 1324) inherited the title Baron Ferrers of Chartley upon his father's death from poisoning in Gascony in 1312.\nPassage 4:\nHumphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford\nHumphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, 6th Earl of Essex, 2nd Earl of Northampton, KG (March 25, 1342 \u2013 January 16, 1373) was the son of William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, and Elizabeth de Badlesmere, and grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, by Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, daughter of King Edward I. He became heir to the Earldom of Hereford after the death of his childless uncle Humphrey de Bohun, 6th Earl of Hereford.\nFollowing King Peter I's visit to England, Humphrey participated in the sack of Alexandria in 1365.His wife and the mother of his daughters was Joan Fitzalan, daughter of Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel, and Eleanor of Lancaster, whom he married after 9 September 1359.\nOn his death, his estates were inherited by his two surviving daughters and his titles went into abeyance: \n\nEleanor de Bohun (1366 - 3 October 1399); married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, youngest son of Edward III; mother of Anne of Gloucester.\nMary de Bohun, who married Henry Bolingbroke, the future King Henry IV of England.\nElizabeth de Bohun, died young.\nPassage 5:\nJohn de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford\nJohn de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford (23 November 1306 \u2013 20 January 1336) was born in St Clement's, Oxford to Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, a daughter of Edward I of England.\nAfter his father's death at the Battle of Boroughbridge, the family lands were forfeited. It was not until after the fall of the Despensers that John was permitted to succeed to his inherited position as Earl of Hereford and Essex, hereditary Constable of England, and Lord of Brecknock.\n\nMarriages\nHe married firstly, in 1325, to Alice FitzAlan (died 1326), daughter of Edmund FitzAlan, 2nd Earl of Arundel, and secondly to Margaret Basset (died 1355). After the marriage, it was discovered that the couple were related to the fourth degree of consanguinity and they were forced to live apart. An appeal to Pope John XXII resulted on 19 February 1331 in a papal commission to the bishops of Lichfield and London to hold an enquiry into the case. However, Roger Northburgh, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, failed to act and the case was still pending when the Pope issued a further demand for an enquiry in 1334.\n\nDeath\nHe did not play much of a public role, despite his high titles and offices, most likely because he had some sort of incapacity. His younger brothers were often deputed to fulfil his duties as Constable. He died at Kirkby Thore, Westmorland and was interred in Stratford Langthorne Abbey, London.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nEleanor de Braose\nEleanor de Braose (c. 1228\u20131251) was a Cambro-Norman noblewoman and a wealthy co-heiress of her father, who was the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose, and of her mother, Eva Marshal, a co-heiress of the Earls of Pembroke. Her husband was Humphrey de Bohun, heir of the 2nd Earl of Hereford, by whom she had children, including Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and Gilbert de Bohun.\n\nFamily\nEleanor was born in about 1228. She was the youngest of four daughters and a co-heiress of the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose, and Eva Marshal, both of whom held considerable lordships and domains in the Welsh Marches and Ireland. Eva was one of the daughters of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke by Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke, daughter of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, \"Strongbow\". Eleanor's three sisters were Isabella de Braose, Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer, and Eva de Braose, wife of William de Cantelou.While Eleanor was a young girl, her father - known to the Welsh as Gwilym Ddu (Black William) - was hanged on the orders of Llewelyn the Great, Prince of Wales for alleged adultery with Llewelyn's wife, Joan, Lady of Wales. Following the execution, her mother held de Braose lands and castles in her own right.\n\nMarriage and issue\nOn an unknown date after August 1241, Eleanor became the first wife of Humphrey de Bohun, the son of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford and Maud de Lusignan. The marriage took place after the death of Humphrey's mother, Maud.Humphrey and Eleanor had the following children:\n\nHumphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford (c.1249- 31 December 1298), married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand II de Fiennes and Isabelle de Conde, by whom he had issue, including Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.\nGilbert de Bohun.(b.1251 - 1297) married Margarite had issue Gilbert (b.1302 d. 1381)His brother granted him Eleanor's lands in Ireland.\nEleanor de Bohun (died 20 February 1314, buried Walden Abbey). She married Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby on 26 June 1269. They had at least two sons and one daughter.\nMargery de Bohun (fl.1265 \u2013 1280) married Theobald de Verdun and had a son also Theobald de Verdun, both of whom were hereditary Constables of Ireland.Eleanor died in 1251, and was buried at Llanthony Secunda Priory. She passed on her considerable possessions in the Welsh Marches to her eldest son Humphrey. Her husband survived her, married Joan de Quincy, and died in 1265.\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nWilliam de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton\nWilliam de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, KG (c. 1312 \u2013 16 September 1360) was an English nobleman and military commander.\n\nLineage\nHe was the fifth son of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan. He had a twin brother, Edward. His maternal grandparents were Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen consort Eleanor of Castile.\n\nLife\nWilliam de Bohun assisted at the arrest of Roger Mortimer in 1330, allowing Edward III to take power. After this, he was a trusted friend and commander of the king and he participated in the renewed wars with Scotland.In 1332, he received many new properties: Hinton and Spaine in Berkshire; Great Haseley, Ascott, Deddington, Pyrton and Kirtlington in Oxfordshire; Wincomb in Buckinghamshire; Longbenington in Lincolnshire; Kneesol in Nottinghamshire; Newnsham in Gloucestershire, Wix in Essex, and Bosham in Sussex.\nIn 1335, he married Elizabeth de Badlesmere (1313 \u2013 8 June 1356). Her parents Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, and Margaret de Clare had both turned against Edward II the decade before. Elizabeth and William were granted some of the property of Elizabeth's first husband, who had also been Mortimer's son and heir.\nWilliam was created Earl of Northampton in 1337, one of the six earls created by Edward III to renew the ranks of the higher nobility. Since de Bohun was a younger son, and did not have an income suitable to his rank, he was given an annuity until suitable estates could be found.\nIn 1349 he became a Knight of the Garter. He served as High Sheriff of Rutland from 1349 until his death in 1360.\n\nCampaigns in Flanders, Brittany, Scotland, Sluys and Crecy\nIn 1339 he accompanied the King to Flanders.  He served variously in Brittany and in Scotland, and was present at the great English victories at Sluys and Cr\u00e9cy, the latter as a commander. His most stunning feat was leading an English force to victory against a much bigger French force at the Battle of Morlaix in 1342. Some of the details are in dispute, but it is clear that he made good use of pit traps, which stopped the French cavalry.\n\nDiplomat\nIn addition to being a warrior, William was also a renowned diplomat.  He negotiated two treaties with France, one in 1343 and one in 1350. He was also charged with negotiating in Scotland for the freedom of King David Bruce, King of Scots, who was held prisoner by the English.\n\nSenior naval command\nFrom the 8 March 1352 to 5 March 1355 he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas, Fleet.\n\nIssue\n1.

He was also an active participant in the Welsh Wars and maintained for several years a private feud with the earl of Gloucester. His father, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, fought on the side of the rebellious barons in the Barons' War. When Humphrey (V) predeceased his father, Humphrey (VI) became heir to his grandfather, Humphrey (IV). At Humphrey (IV)'s death in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. He also inherited major possessions in the Welsh Marches from his mother, Eleanor de Braose.\nBohun spent most of his early career reconquering marcher lands captured by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 1282\u201383 and 1294\u201395. At the same time he also had private feuds with other marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartarum\u2014a confirmation of Magna Carta\u2014and Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.\n\nFamily background and inheritance\nHumphrey (VI) de Bohun was part of a line of Anglo-Norman aristocrats going back to the Norman Conquest, most of whom carried the same name. His grandfather was Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, who had been part of the baronial opposition of Simon de Montfort, but later gone over to the royal side. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, but was restored to favour after the royalist victory at the Battle of Evesham the next year. Humphrey (IV)'s son, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, remained loyal to the baronial side throughout the Barons' War, and was captured at Evesham on 4 August 1265. In October of that year, Humphrey (V) died in captivity at Beeston Castle in Cheshire from injuries he had sustained in the battle.Humphrey (V) had been excluded from succession as a result of his rebellion, but when Humphrey (IV) died in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. Humphrey (VI) had already served as deputy Constable of England under Humphrey (IV). Humphrey (IV) had reserved the honour of Pleshey for his younger son Henry, but the remainder of his lands went to Humphrey (VI). The inheritance Humphrey (VI) received\u2014in addition to land in Essex and Wiltshire from Humphrey (IV)\u2014also consisted of significant holdings in the Welsh Marches from his mother. His mother Eleanor was a daughter and coheir of William de Braose and his wife Eva Marshal, who in turn was the daughter and co-heir of William Marshal, regent to Henry III.Since Humphrey (VI) was only sixteen years old at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands were taken into the king's custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the meanwhile given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.He granted his brother Sir Gilbert de Bohun all of their mother's lands in Ireland and some land in England and Wales.\n\nWelsh Wars\nOver the next years, much of Hereford's focus was on reconquering his lost lands in the Marches, primarily through private warfare against Llywelyn. Henry III died in 1272, while his son\u2014now Edward I\u2014was crusading; Edward did not return until 1274. Llywelyn refused to pay homage to the new king, partly because of the military actions of Bohun and other marcher lords, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery. On 12 November 1276, Hereford was present at a royal assembly where judgment was passed on Llewelyn, and in 1277, Edward I declared war on the Welsh prince. Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford's participation in the early days of the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion and conquer lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.In 1282, war with Wales broke out again; this time it would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a full-scale war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted on the use of the feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post-war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 1294\u201395, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.\n\nPrivate war in the Marches\nParallel with the Welsh Wars, Hereford was also struggling to assert his claims to lands in the Marches against other marcher lords. In 1284 Edward I granted the hundred of Iscennen in Carmarthenshire to John Giffard. Hereford believed the land belonged to him by right of conquest, and started a campaign to win the lands back, but the king took Giffard's side. Problems also arose with the earl of Gloucester. As Gloucester's former ward, Hereford had to buy back his own right of marriage, but Gloucester claimed he had not received the full sum. There was also remaining resentment on Hereford's part for his subordination to Gloucester in the 1282\u201383 campaign. The conflict came to a head when Gloucester's started construction of a castle at Morlais, which Hereford claimed was his land. In 1286, the Crown ordered Gloucester to cease, but to no avail.It had long been established Marches custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, and now he was facing open conflict with two different enemies. He, therefore, decided to take the issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offence was not the private warfare in itself, but the fact that the earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.In the end, the fines were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had nevertheless demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marches lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was, therefore, a good opportunity to assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.\n\nOpposition to Edward I\nIn 1294 the French king declared the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and war broke out between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not in the company of the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.\n  \nAt the time of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was accompanying two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reason for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in the midst of an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.Neither party showed any inclination to back down, and the nation seemed on the brink of another civil war. Just as the conflict was coming to a head, however, external events intervened to settle it. In September 1297, the English suffered a heavy defeat to the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The Scottish victory exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The war with Scotland received wider support from the English magnates, now that their own homeland was threatened, than did the war in France to protect the king's continental possessions. Edward abandoned his campaign in France and negotiated a truce with the French king. He agreed to confirm Magna Carta in the so-called Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of the Charters). The earls consequently consented to serve with the king in Scotland, and Hereford was in the army that won a decisive victory over the Scots in the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Hereford, not satisfied that the king had upheld the charter, withdrew after the battle, forcing Edward to abandon the campaign.\n\nDeath and family\nIn 1275 Bohun married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand de Fiennes, chevalier, seigneur of Fiennes, by his 2nd wife, Isabel (kinswoman of Queen Eleanor of Provence). She predeceased him, and was buried at Walden Priory in Essex. Hereford himself died at Pleshey Castle on 31 December 1298, and was buried at Walden alongside his wife. They had one son Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, born around 1276. The son was given possession of his father's lands and titles on 16 February 1299. The young Humphrey also inherited his father's title of Constable of England.A common theme in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce protection of what he regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, at the height of the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nHumphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford\nHumphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204 \u2013 24 September 1275) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and soldier who served as hereditary Constable of England.\n\nOrigins\nHe was the eldest son and heir of Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176\u20131220) by his wife Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex.\n\nCareer\nHe was one of the nine godfathers of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I. He served as Sheriff of Kent for 1239\u201340. In 1258, after returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Humphrey fell away, like his father, from the royal cause to that of the barons. He served as a nominee of the opposition on the \"committee of twenty-four\" which was appointed in the Oxford Parliament of that year, to create the Provisions of Oxford to reform the administration. The alliance of Simon de Montfort with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of North Wales brought Bohun back to royal allegiance. He headed the first secession of the Welsh Marchers from the party of the opposition (1263), and was among the captives whom the Montfortians took at the Battle of Lewes in 1264.He was amongst the victors at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, which extinguished the power of de Montfort, at which, however, his eldest son, Humphrey V de Bohun, was mortally wounded. Humphrey was selected as one of the twelve arbitrators to draw up the Dictum of Kenilworth (1266), by which the disinherited rebels were allowed to make their peace.\n\nMarriages and issue\nHe married twice:\n\nFirstly, in about 1236, to Maud de Lusignan (c. 1210 \u2013 14 August 1241), daughter of Raoul I of Lusignan, Comte d'Eu, second husband of Alix d'Eu, 8th Comtesse d'Eu. She died in 1241 and was buried at Llanthony, Gloucester, together with her husband. By Maud he had issue including:\nHumphrey V de Bohun (died 1265), eldest son and heir apparent, who predeceased his father, having shared with him in the victory at the Battle of Evesham (1264), which he did not long survive. The earldom, therefore, passed to his son Humphrey VI de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, 2nd Earl of Essex (c. 1249 \u2013 1298).\nHenry de Bohun\nGeoffrey de Bohun\nRalph de Bohun, Cleric;\nMaud de Bohun, who married firstly Anselm Marshal, 6th Earl of Pembroke; secondly Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester;\nAlice de Bohun, who married Roger V de Toeni;\nEleanor de Bohun, who married Sir John de Verdun, Baron of Westmeath\nSecondly, he married Maud de Avenbury (died 8 October 1273), by whom he had two further sons:\nJohn de Bohun\nSir Miles de Bohun\n\nDeath and burial\nHe died in 1275 in Warwickshire and was buried at Llanthony Secunda in Gloucester. He was succeeded by his grandson Humphrey VI de Bohun (c. 1249 \u2013 1298).\n\nNotes\nPassage 10:\nHenry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford\nHenry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176 \u2013 1 June 1220) of Pleshy Castle in Essex, was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who became Hereditary Constable of England from 1199.\n\nOrigins\nHe was the son and heir of Humphrey III de Bohun (pre-1144-1181) \nof Trowbridge Castle in Wiltshire and of Caldicot Castle in south-east Wales, 5th feudal baron of Trowbridge, who served King Henry II as Lord High Constable of England. His mother was Margaret of Huntingdon, widow of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany (d.1171) and a daughter of Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, son of King David I of Scotland by his wife Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon. Henry's half-sister was Constance, Duchess of Brittany.\n\nEarldom\nHis paternal grandmother was Margaret of Hereford, a daughter of Miles FitzWalter of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, Lord of Brecknock (died 1143), Sheriff of Gloucester and Constable of England. After the male line of Miles of Gloucester failed, in 1199 King John created Henry de Bohun Earl of Hereford and Constable of England. His lands lay chiefly on the Welsh Marches, and from this date the Bohuns took a foremost place among the Marcher barons.Henry de Bohun was one of the twenty-five barons elected by their peers to enforce the terms of Magna Carta in 1215. He was subsequently excommunicated by the Pope. In the civil war that followed Magna Carta, he was a supporter of King Louis VIII of France and was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1217.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, of Pleshy Castle in Essex, by whom he had issue including:\n\nHumphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204-1275), eldest son and heir, created Earl of Essex in 1239, who married Maud de Lusignan, by whom he had at least three children.\nHenry de Bohun, who died young.\nRalph de Bohun.\n\nDeath\nHe died in June 1220 while on crusade to the Holy Land.","label":"longbench","length":7357,"title":"Passage 1:"}

The RKKY interaction competes\nwith the Kondo effect and leads to the quantum phase transition of a still debated nature\n\\cite{Doniach,Jones,Affleck,Bork,Neel,KondoRKKYexp,Hans,Hans2,Fabian}.\nMoreover, in DQDs coupled in series also \\emph{superexchange} can alter the Kondo physics significantly\n\\cite{Zitko_2QDEx,Sela}.\n\nRecently, hybrid quantum devices, in which the interplay between various magnetic correlations\nwith superconductivity (SC) plays an important role, have become an important direction of research\n\\cite{hybridQDs,SCspintronics}. In particular, chains of magnetic atoms on SC surface have proven \nto contain self-organized Majorana quasi-particles and exotic spin textures\n\\cite{Braunecker,Klinovaja,Vazifeh,Yazdani},\nwhile hybrid DQD structures have been used to split the Cooper pairs coherently into two entangled \nelectrons propagating to separated normal leads \\cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9}.\nThe latter is possible due to non-local (\\emph{crossed}) Andreev reflections (CARs),\nin which each electron of a Cooper pair tunnels into different QD, and\nsubsequently to attached lead. Such processes give rise to an exchange mechanism \\cite{Yao},\nthat we henceforth refer to as \\emph{the CAR exchange}, which can greatly modify\nthe low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures.\n\nThe CAR exchange may be seen as RKKY-like interaction between\ntwo nearby impurities on SC surface \\cite{Yao}.\nThe effect can be understood as a consequence\nof spin-dependent hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)\nstates \\cite{Yu,Shiba,Rusinov} in SC contact,\ncaused both by the overlap of their wave functions\nand their coupling to Cooper-pair condensate.\nThis process is the most effective when the YSR states \nare close to the middle of the SC gap, {\\it e.g.} in the YSR-screened phase \\cite{YSRscreening}.\nThe mechanism presented here is essentially the same,\nyet in the considered regime can be understood\nperturbatively without referring to YSR states,\nas a consequence of the non-local pairing induced by SC electrode. \nIn particular, the presence of YSR bound states close to the Fermi level \nis not necessary for significant consequences for the Kondo physics, \nas long as some inter-dot pairing is present. \n\n\nThe proximity of SC induces pairing in QDs \\cite{RozhkovArovas,Buitelaar} \nand tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap $2\\Delta$ \nbecomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_K$ \n\\cite{Buitelaar2002Dec,adatomsSC,Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo_vs_SC2,Zitko_Kondo-Andreev,Zitko_S-QD-N,IW_Sau,YSRscreening}.\nMoreover, the strength of SC pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime:\nFor QDs attached to SC and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect\n\\cite{DomanskiIW,KWIW,part1}, while\nfor DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, it tends to suppress both the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Kondo effects \\cite{IW_Kacper}.\nOur main result is that the non-local pairing induced by superconducting \nproximity effect, which gives rise to CAR exchange, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening.\nMoreover, relatively small values of coupling to SC, $\\GS{}\\ll U$, are sufficient for the effect to occur.\nThis is in contrast to the DQD system considered in Ref.~\\cite{part1},\nwhere only one of the quantum dots is proximized, such that \nCAR exchange cannot arise,\nand the Kondo physics becomes qualitatively\naffected only for $\\GS{}\\sim U\/2$.%\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[bt]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Fig1.png}\n\\caption{\n\t\t (a) Schematic of the considered system.

In \\Sec{model} we describe the considered system \nand present the model we use to study it. In \\Sec{scales} the relevant energy scales are estimated\nto make the discussion of main results concerning CAR-induced Kondo effect in \\Sec{main} more clear. \nFinally, the influence of effects neglected in \\Sec{main} are presented in the following sections,\nincluding CAR exchange interplay with RKKY interaction (\\Sec{RKKY}), particle-hole asymmetry (\\Sec{asym}),\ncouplings asymmetry (\\Sec{x}) and reduced efficiency of CAR coupling (\\Sec{coef}). In summary,\nthe effects discussed in \\Sec{main} remain qualitatively valid in all these cases.\nThe paper is concluded in \\Sec{conclusions}.\n\n\n\\section{Model}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\nThe schematic of the considered system is depicted in \\fig{system}(a).\nIt contains two QDs attached to a common SC lead.\nOnly one of them (QD1) is directly attached to the left (L) and right (R) normal leads,\nwhile the other dot (QD2) remains coupled only through QD1.\nThe SC is modeled by the BCS Hamiltonian, \n$H_{\\mathrm{S}}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^{\\dag}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}-\\Delta\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}(a^\\dag_{\\mathbf{k}\\uparrow}a_{-\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow}^{\\dag}+a_{-\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow}a_{\\mathbf{k}\\uparrow})$,\nwith energy dispersion $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$, energy gap $2\\Delta>0$ and $a_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$ annihilation operator \nof electron possessing spin $\\sigma$ and momentum $\\mathbf{k}$. The coupling between\nSC and QDs is described by the hopping Hamiltonian \n$H_{\\mathrm{TS}}=\\sum_{i\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}v_{\\mathrm{S}i}(d^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}a^{}_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}+h.c.)$,\nwith $d^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}$ creating a spin-$\\sigma$ electron at QD$i$. The matrix element \n$v_{\\mathrm{S}i}$ and the normalized density of states of SC in normal state, $\\rho_{\\rm S}$, \ncontribute to the coupling of QD$i$ to SC electrode as $\\GS{i} = \\pi \\rho_{\\rm S} |v_{{\\rm S}i}|^2$. \nWe focus on the sub-gap regime, therefore, we integrate out SC degrees of freedom lying outside the energy gap \\cite{RozhkovArovas}.\nThis gives rise to the following effective Hamiltonian,\n$H_{\\mathrm{eff}}=H_{\\mathrm{SDQD}}+H_{\\rm L}+H_{\\rm R}+H_{\\rm T}$, \nwhere \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_{\\rm SDQD} \t& = & \n\t\t\t\t\\sum_{i\\sigma} \\varepsilon_{i} n_{i\\sigma} \n\t\t\t\t+\\sum_{i} U n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow} \n\t\t\t\t+U' (n_1-1)(n_2-1) \n\t\t\t\t\\nonumber\\\\\n\t\t\t\t&+&\\sum_\\sigma t(d^\\dagger_{1\\sigma}d^{}_{2\\sigma} + h.c.) \n\t\t\t\t+J \\vec{S}_1\\vec{S}_2\n\t\t\t\t\\nonumber\\\\\n\t\t\t\t&+&\\sum_{i} \\!\\!\\left[ \\Gamma_{{\\rm S}i} (d^\\dagger_{i\\uparrow} d^\\dagger_{i\\downarrow} \\!+\\! h.c.)\n\t\t\t\t+\\Gamma_{\\rm SX} (d^\\dagger_{i\\uparrow} d^\\dagger_{\\bar{i}\\downarrow} \\!+\\! h.c.) \\right]\n\t\\label{H_DQD} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nis the Hamiltonian of the SC-proximized DQD\n\\cite{IW_Kacper,Walldorf2018Feb}, with QD$i$ energy level $\\varepsilon_i$,\ninter-site (intra-site) Coulomb interactions $U'$ ($U$),\ninter-dot hopping $t$, and CAR coupling $\\GS{\\rm X}$.\n$n_{i\\sigma}=d^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}d^{}_{i\\sigma}$ denotes the electron number operator \nat QD$i$, $n_i=n_\\uparrow+n_\\downarrow$, and $\\bar{i}\\equiv 3-i$. \nOur model is strictly valid in the regime where $\\Delta$ is the largest \nenergy scale. Nevertheless, all discussed phenomena are\npresent in a full model for energies smaller than SC gap.\nMoreover, by eliminating other consequences of the presence of SC lead,\nour model pinpoints the fact that the non-local pairing is \nsufficient for the occurrence of the CAR exchange.\nThe presence of out-gap states shall result mainly in additional broadening of DQD energy levels,\nchanging the relevant Kondo temperatures.\nWe note that the procedure of integrating out out-gap states neglects the \nRKKY interaction mediated by SC lead and other possible indirect exchange mechanisms%\n \\footnote{\n Note, that by RKKY interaction we mean only such an effective exchange, \n which arises due to multiple scattering of a single electron or hole, see \\fig{system}(h)-(j).\n Other mechanisms leading to the total indirect exchange are considered separately.\n In particular, in the large gap limit, exchange described in Ref.~\\cite{Yao} is in fact reduced to\n the CAR exchange, and additional antiferromagnetic contribution would arise for finite gap.\n }. \nTo compensate for this,\nwe explicitly include the Heisenberg term $ J \\vec{S}_1\\vec{S}_2$ in\n$H_{\\rm SDQD}$, with $\\vec{S}_i$ denoting the spin operator of QD$i$\nand a Heisenberg coupling $J$ substituting the genuine RKKY exchange.\n\nThe normal leads are treated as reservoirs of noninteracting electrons,\n$H_{r}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}\\varepsilon_{r\\mathbf{k}}c^\\dagger_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}c^{}_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$,\nwhere $c^{}_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$ annihilates an electron of spin \n$\\sigma$ and momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ in lead $r$ ($r={\\rm L,R}$) with the corresponding energy $\\varepsilon_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}$.\nThe tunneling Hamiltonian reads,\n$H_{\\rm T} = \\sum_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma} v_{r} (d^\\dagger_{1\\sigma}c^{}_{r\\mathbf{k}\\sigma} + h.c.)$,\ngiving rise to coupling between lead $r$ and QD$i$ of strength $\\Gamma_r = \\pi \\rho_r |v_r|^2$,\nwith $\\rho_r$ the normalized density of states of lead $r$ and $v_r$ the \nlocal hopping matrix element, assumed momentum-independent.\nWe consider a wide-band limit, assuming constant $\\Gamma_r=\\Gamma\/2$\nwithin the cutoff $\\pm D = \\pm 2U$ around the Fermi level. \n\nFor thorough analysis of the CAR exchange mechanism and its consequences\nfor transport, we determine the linear conductance between the two normal leads from\n\\begin{equation}\nG = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\pi \\Gamma \\int \\left[ -\\frac{\\partial f_T}{\\partial\\omega} \\right] \\mathcal{A}(\\omega) {\\rm d} \\omega ,\n\\label{G}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $f_T$ is the Fermi function at temperature $T$,\nwhile $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$ denotes the normalized local spectral density \nof QD1 \\cite{fn1}.\nHenceforth, unless we state otherwise, we assume a maximal CAR coupling, \n$\\GS{\\rm X} = \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$ \\cite{IW_Kacper,Walldorf2018Feb},\n$\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{}$ and consider DQD tuned to the particle-hole symmetry point, \n$\\varepsilon_1=\\varepsilon_2=-U\/2$. However, these assumptions are not crucial for the results presented\nhere, as discussed in Secs.~\\ref{sec:asym}-\\ref{sec:coef}.\n\n\\section{Estimation of relevant energy scales}\n\\label{sec:scales}\n\nSince we analyze a relatively complex system, let us build up the understanding of its behavior starting\nfrom the case of a QD between two normal-metallic leads, which can be obtained in our \nmodel by setting $t=\\GS{}=J=U'=0$. Then, the conductance as a function of temperature, $G(T)$, grows\nbelow the Kondo temperature $T_K$ and reaches maximum for $T\\to 0$, $G(T\\!=\\!0)=G_{\\rm max}$.\nAt particle-hole symmetry point, the unitary transmission is achieved, $G_{\\rm max}= G_0 = 2e^2\/h$;\nsee short-dashed line in \\fig{G-T}(a).\nAn experimentally relevant definition of $T_K$ is that at $T=T_K$ \n$G(T)=G_{\\rm max}\/2$. $T_K$ is exponentially small in \nthe local exchange $J_0 = 8\\Gamma \/ (\\pi \\rho U)$, and is approximated by\n$T_K \\approx D \\exp[-1\/(\\rho J_0)]$ \\cite{Hewson_book}.\n\nThe presence of a second side-coupled QD, $t,U'>0$, significantly enriches the physics of the system \nby introducing direct exchange between QDs, see \\fig{system}(b-d).\nIn general, effective inter-dot exchange can be defined as energy difference between \nthe triplet and singlet states of isolated DQD, \n$J^{\\mathrm{eff}} = E_{S=1} - E_{\\rm GS}$. Unless $U$ becomes very large, superexchange can be neglected\n\\cite{Zitko_2QDEx} and $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is determined by \\emph{direct exchange}, $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}\\approx 4t^2\/(U-U')>0$.\nWhen the hopping $t$ is tuned small \\cite{CPS1}, one can expect $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}\\lesssim T_K$, which \nimplies the two-stage Kondo screening \\cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia}.\nThen, for $T \\ll T_K$, the local spectral density of QD1 serves as a band of width $\\sim T_K$ for QD2.\nThe spin of an electron occupying QD2 \nexperiences the Kondo screening below the associated Kondo temperature\n\\begin{equation}\nT^* = a T_K \\exp(- b T_K \/ J_{\\rm eff})\n\\label{Tstar}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $a$ and $b$ constants of order of unity \\cite{Pustilnik_Glazman,Cornaglia}.\nThis is reflected in conductance, which drops to $0$ with lowering $T$, maintaining characteristic \nFermi-liquid \n$G\\sim T^2$ dependence \\cite{Cornaglia}; see the curves indicated with squares \nin \\fig{G-T}(a). Similarly to $T_K$, experimentally relevant definition of $T^*$ is that \n$G(T\\!=\\!T^*) = G_{\\rm max}\/2$. Even at the particle-hole \nsymmetry point $G_{\\rm max} < G_0$, because the single-QD strong-coupling fixed point \nis unstable in the presence of QD2 and $G(T)$ does not achieve $G_0$ exactly,\nbefore it starts to decrease.\n\n\nThe proximity of SC gives rise to two further exchange mechanisms that\ndetermine the system's behavior. First of all, the (conventional)\n\\emph{RKKY interaction} appears, $J \\sim \\GS{}^2$ \\cite{RK,K,Y}. \nMoreover, the \\emph{CAR exchange} emerges as a consequence of finite $\\GS{}$ \\cite{Yao}. \nIt can be understood on the basis \nof perturbation theory as follows. DQD in the inter-dot singlet state may absorb\nand re-emit a Cooper pair approaching from SC; see \\fig{system}(e)-(g). As a second-order\nprocess, it reduces the energy of the singlet, which is the ground state of isolated DQD.\nA similar process is not possible in the triplet state due to spin conservation.\nTherefore, the singlet-triplet energy splitting $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increased (or generated for $t=J=0$). \nMore precisely, the leading ($2$nd-order in $t$ and $\\GS{}$) terms\nin the total exchange are \n\\begin{equation}\nJ^{\\mathrm{eff}} \t\\approx \tJ + \\frac{4t^2}{U-U'+\\frac{3}{4}J} + \\frac{4\\GS{}^2}{U+U'+\\frac{3}{4}J}.\n\\label{Jeff}\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this estimation, one can predict $T^*$ for finite $\\GS{}$, $t$ and $J$ with \\eq{Tstar}.\nApparently, from three contributions corresponding to:\n(i) RKKY interaction, (ii) direct exchange and (iii) CAR exchange, only the first may bear a negative (ferromagnetic) sign.\nThe two other contributions always have an anti-ferromagnetic nature.\nMore accurate expression for $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is derived in Appendix~\\ref{sec:downfolding}\n[see \\eq{A_J}] by the Hamiltonian down-folding procedure. The relevant terms differ \nby factors important only for large $\\GS{}\/U$. \nFinally, it seems worth stressing that normal leads are not necessary for CAR exchange to occur.\nAt least one of them is inevitable for the Kondo screening though, and two symmetrically coupled \nnormal leads allow for measurement of the normal conductance.\n\n\nIt is also noteworthy that inter-dot Coulomb interactions\ndecrease the energy of intermediate states contributing to direct exchange \n[\\fig{system}(c)], while increasing the energy of intermediate\nstates causing the CAR exchange [\\fig{system}(f)].\nThis results in different dependence of corresponding terms in \\eq{Jeff} on $U'$.\nAs can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(b) and \\ref{fig:G-T}(c), it has a significant effect \non the actual values of $T^*$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Fig2.pdf}\n\\caption{(a) Linear conductance $G$ as function of $T$ calculated for \n\t\t $\\varepsilon_1=\\varepsilon_2=-U\/2$, $\\Gamma=U\/5$, $U'=U\/10$ and different situations, \n\t\t as indicated.

Therefore, we first neglect the conventional RKKY coupling and analyze its consequences in Sec.~\\ref{sec:RKKY}.\n\nThe main results are presented in \\fig{G-T}(a), showing the temperature dependence of $G$\nfor different circumstances. \nFor reference, results for $\\GS{}=0$ are shown, exhibiting \nthe two-stage Kondo effect caused by \\emph{direct} exchange mechanism.\nAs can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(b) and \\ref{fig:G-T}(c), an excellent agreement of $T^*$ found from NRG calculations and \\eq{Tstar} \nis obtained with $a=0.42$ and $b=1.51$, the same for both $U'=0$ and $U'=U\/10$. Note, \nhowever, that $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is different in these cases, cf. \\eq{Jeff},\nand $U'$ leads to increase of $T^*$.\n\nFurthermore, for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ the two-stage Kondo effect caused solely by the \\emph{CAR\nexchange} is present; see \\fig{G-T}(a).\nExperimentally, this situation\ncorresponds to a distance between the two QDs smaller than the superconducting coherence length,\nbut large enough for the exponentially suppressed direct hopping to be negligible.\nWhile intuitively one could expect pairing to compete with any kind of magnetic ordering,\nthe Kondo screening induced by CAR exchange is a beautiful example of a superconductivity\nin fact leading to magnetic order, namely the formation of the Kondo singlet.\nThis CAR-exchange-mediated Kondo screening is our main finding.\nFor such screening, \\eq{Tstar} is still fulfilled with very similar \nparameters, $a=0.37$ ($a=0.35$) and $b=1.51$ ($b=1.50$) for $U'=0$ ($U'=U\/10$),\ncorrespondingly; see \\figs{G-T}(b-c).\nMoreover, as follows from \\eq{Jeff}, $U'$ reduces CAR exchange, and therefore diminishes $T^*$.\nFor the same values of $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the dependence of $G(T)$ for $t=0$ and $\\GS{}>0$ is hardly different \nfrom the one for $\\GS{}=0$ and $t>0$ for $T\\geq T^*$ (results not shown).\nHowever, $G(T)$ saturates at residual value $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as $T\\to 0$ only for finite\n$\\GS{}$, which at particle-hole symmetry makes $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$\nthe hallmark of SC proximity and the corresponding CAR exchange processes.\nFrom numerical results, one can estimate it as\n\\begin{equation}\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\, \\frac{\\GS{}^2}{U^2} \n\t\\qquad {\\scriptstyle (\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{})} ,\n\\label{Gmin}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $c\\approx 2.25$, barely depending on $U'$ and getting smaller for $t>0$. \nThis is illustrated in \\figs{G-T}(d-e), where the dotted line corresponds to \\eq{Gmin} with $c=2.25$. \n\nLastly, in \\fig{G-T}(a) we also present the curves obtained for $t=\\GS{}$ chosen such, \nthat the quantity $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2+\\GS{}^2}$ remains the same \nin all the cases.\nThis is to illustrate what happens when \\emph{both} (direct and CAR) exchange interactions are\npresent. \\fig{G-T}(c) clearly shows that $T^*$ remains practically unaltered for $U'=0$.\nThe comparison with \\fig{G-T}(b) proves that in this case it practically does not depend \non $U'$. The enhancement of direct exchange is compensated by the decrease of the CAR one. \nOn the contrary, $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ decreases for larger $t$ below the estimation given by Eq.~(\\ref{Gmin}), \nas can be seen in \\figs{G-T}(d-e). \n\nWhile analyzing the results concerning $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\GS{})$ plotted in \\figs{G-T}(d-e) \none needs to keep in mind that $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ is obtained at deeply cryogenic conditions. To illustrate\nthis better, $G(\\GS{})$ obtained for $t=0$ and $T=10^{-6}U$ is plotted with solid line \nin \\fig{3}. Clearly, for weak $\\GS{}$ the system exhibits rather conventional (single-stage)\nKondo effect with $G=G_{\\mathrm{max}}\\approx 2e^2\/h$, while QD2 is effectively decoupled ($G_{\\mathrm{max}}<2e^2\/h$\nin the proximity of SC lead \\cite{KWIW}). Only for larger values of $\\GS{}$\nthe CAR exchange is strong enough, such that $T^*>T$ and the dependence $G(\\GS{})$ continuously \napproaches the $T=0$ limit estimated by \\eq{Gmin} and presented in \\figs{G-T}(d-e).\n\n\\section{CAR-RKKY competition}\n\\label{sec:RKKY}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig3.pdf}\n\\caption{Linear conductance $G$ vs. $\\GS{}$ calculated\n\t\t for $t=0$, $\\Gamma=U\/5$, $U'=U\/10$, finite $T=10^{-6}U$\n\t\t and different values of RKKY coupling $J$, as indicated. \n\t\t Inset shows QD1 spectral function $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$ as a function of energy $\\omega$\n\t\t for points on $J=-0.1U$ curve, indicated with corresponding symbols.\n\t\t}\n\\label{fig:3}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet us now discuss the effects introduced by the conventional RKKY interaction.\nWe choose $t=0$ for the sake of simplicity and\nanalyze a wide range of $\\GS{}$, starting from the case of anti-ferromagnetic \nRKKY interaction ($J>0$). Large $J>0$ leads to the formation of a molecular singlet in the \nnanostructure. This suppresses the conductance, unless $\\GS{}$ becomes of the order of $U\/2$, \nwhen the excited states of DQD are all close to the ground state. This is illustrated \nby double-dotted line in \\fig{3}.\nSmaller value of $J>0$ causes less dramatic consequences, namely it just increases $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ according\nto \\eq{Jeff}, leading to enhancement of $T^*$, cf. \\eq{Tstar}. This is presented with\ndot-dashed line in \\fig{3}.\n\nThe situation changes qualitatively for ferromagnetic RKKY coupling, $J<0$.\nThen, RKKY exchange and CAR exchange have opposite signs and compete with each other.\nDepending on their magnitudes and temperature, one\nof the following scenarios may happen.\n\nFor $J^{\\mathrm{eff}} > 0$, {\\it i.e.} large enough $\\GS{}$, and $T<T^*$, the system is in the \nsinglet state due to the two-stage Kondo screening of DQD spins. $G(T\\!=\\!0)$ is reduced \nto $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$, which tends to increase for large negative $J$; see dashed lines in \\fig{3}. \nIn the inset to \\fig{3}, the spectral density of QD1 representative for this regime is plotted \nas curve indicated by triangle. It corresponds to a point on the $J=-0.1U$ curve in the main \nplot, also indicated by triangle. The dip in $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$ has width of order of $T^*$.\n\nFor finite $T$, there is always a range of sufficiently small $|J^{\\mathrm{eff}}|$, where QD2 becomes effectively\ndecoupled, and, provided $T<T_K$, $G$ reaches $G_{\\mathrm{max}}$ due to conventional Kondo effect \nat QD1. This is the case for sufficiently small $\\GS{}$ for $J=0$ or $J=-0.01U$, and in the narrow\nrange of $\\GS{}$ around the point indicated by a circle in \\fig{3} for $J=-0.1U$ (for $J=0.01U$, \nthe considered $T$ is close to $T^*$ and $G$ does not reach $G_{\\rm max}$). The conventional Kondo effect manifests itself with \na characteristic peak in $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$, as illustrated in the inset in \\fig{3} with line denoted by circle.\n\nFinally, large enough $J^{\\mathrm{eff}} < 0$ and low $T$, give rise to an effective ferromagnetic coupling of DQDs \nspins into triplet state. Consequently, the underscreened Kondo effect occurs \n\\cite{Mattis,NozieresBlandin} for weak $\\GS{}$ and, {\\it e.g.}, $J=-0.1U$; \nsee the point indicated by square in \\fig{3}.\nThis leads to $G=G_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and a peak in $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$, whose shape is significantly different from the\nKondo peak, cf. the curve denoted by square in the inset in \\fig{3}. \n\n\n\n\\section{Effects of detuning from the particle-hole symmetry point}\n\\label{sec:asym}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig4.pdf}\n\\caption{\n         (a) Linear conductance between the normal leads $G$ as a function of temperature $T$\n         for parameters corresponding to \\fig{G-T}(a) with $\\xi=U\/10$, and additional curves for finite \n         detuning from particle-hole symmetry point, $\\delta_1=-\\delta_2$, \n         and two values of $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2+\\GS{}^2}$, as indicated in the figure.\n         (b) $G_{\\mathrm{min}} \\equiv G(T \\!=\\! 0)$ as a function of QD1 detuning $\\delta_1$ for different\n         exchange mechanisms, $\\xi=U\/10$ and $\\delta_2=\\pm\\delta_1$ (as indicated).\n\t\t}\n\\label{fig:asym}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt PHS $G_{\\mathrm{min}}=G(T \\!=\\! 0)=0$ in the absence of superconducting lead, making $G_{\\mathrm{min}} > 0$ a hallmark\nof SC-induced two-stage Kondo effect. However, outside of PHS point $G_{\\mathrm{min}} > 0$ even in the case of \nthe two-stage Kondo effect caused by the direct exchange. \nExact PHS conditions are hardly possible in real systems, and the fine-tuning of the QD energy\nlevels to PHS point is limited to some finite accuracy.\nTherefore, there may appear a question, if the results obtained at PHS are of any importance for the\nrealistic setups. As we show below --- they are,\nin a reasonable range of detunings $\\delta_i=\\varepsilon_i +U\/2$.\n\nIn \\fig{asym}(a) we present the $G(T)$ dependence in and outside the PHS, corresponding to \nparameters of \\fig{G-T}(a). \nClearly, for considered small values of $\\delta_1=\\delta_2=\\delta$, \n$G_{\\mathrm{min}}<10^{-3}e^2\/h$ for direct exchange only, while $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ in the presence of a superconductor is \nsignificantly increased and close to the PHS value. Furthermore, for $|\\delta_1| \\sim |\\delta_2| \n\\sim \\delta$, the residual conductance caused by the lack of PHS, $G_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx e^2\/h \\cdot (\\delta\/U)^2$,\nwhich is a rapidly decreasing function in the vicinity of PHS point, as illustrated in \\fig{asym}(b)\nwith lines denoted by a square. Evidently, in the regime $|\\delta_i| < 0.01U$ the residual conductance\ncaused by SC is orders of magnitude larger, leading to the plateau in $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependence,\nvisible in \\fig{asym}(b).\nTaking into account that the realistic values of $U$ in the semiconductor quantum dots are rather \nlarge, this condition seems to be realizable by fine-tuning of QD gate voltages.\n\nLastly, let us point out that while in the presence of only one exchange mechanism, \\emph{CAR} or\n\\emph{direct}, $G_{\\mathrm{min}}(\\delta_1)$ dependencies depicted in \\fig{asym}(b) are symmetrical with respect\nto sign change of $\\delta_1$, for \\emph{both} exchange mechanisms the dependence is non-symmetric. \n\n\\section{Effects of asymmetry of couplings to superconductor}\n\\label{sec:x}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig5.pdf}\n\\caption{\n\t\t (a) Linear conductance between the normal leads, $G$, as a function of temperature, $T$,\n\t\t for parameters corresponding to \\fig{G-T}(a) with $\\xi=U\/10$, for different values \n\t\t of asymmetry coefficient $x$ [see \\eq{xGS}], in the presence of \\emph{CAR} exchange only.\n\t\t %\n\t\t (b) The second-stage Kondo temperature $T^*$ normalized by $T_K$ as a function of $x$, \n\t\t calculated with the aid of NRG (points) and a fit to \\eq{Tstar} (lines) \n\t\t with $J^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from \\eq{Jeff}.\n\t\t %\n\t\t (c) The zero-temperature conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ as a function of QD1 coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{1}$,\n\t\t compiled from data obtained at different circumstances (as indicated in the legend)\n\t\t for different $x$.

As shown below, it does not introduce any qualitatively new features.\nOn the other hand, it decreases the second stage Kondo temperature, which is already small, therefore,\nquantitative estimation of this decrease may be important for potential experimental approaches.\nTo analyze the effects of $\\GS{1}\\neq\\GS{2}$, we introduce the asymmetry parameter $x$ and extend\nthe definition of $\\GS{}$,\n\\beq\nx = \\frac{\\GS{1}-\\GS{2}}{\\GS{1}+\\GS{2}}, \\quad \\GS{} = \\frac{\\GS{1}+\\GS{2}}{2}.\n\\label{xGS}\n \\end{equation} \nNote, that even for a fixed $\\GS{}$, the actual CAR coupling $\\GS{\\rm X}=\\GS{}\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ decreases\nwith increasing $|x|$, which is a main mechanism leading to a decrease of $T^*$ outside the $x=0$ point\nvisible in \\figs{x}(a) and (b). To illustrate this, the curves corresponding to \\emph{both} exchange\nmechanisms were calculated using $x$-dependent $t=\\GS{\\rm X}$ instead of $t=\\xi\/\\sqrt{2}$. \nTherefore, $\\xi$ was generalized for $x\\neq 0$ by setting $\\xi=\\sqrt{t^2(1-x^2)^{-1}+\\GS{}^2}$.\nClearly, in \\fig{x}(b) the curves for different exchange mechanisms are very similar and differ mainly \nby a constant factor, resulting from different influence of $U'$; see \\Sec{scales}. \nThe magnitude of $T^*$ changes is quite large, exceeding an order of magnitude for $x=\\pm 0.5$ \nand $\\xi=U\/20$. Moreover, $T^* \\to 0$ for $x\\to\\pm 1$. Consequently, for strongly asymmetric\ndevices one cannot hope to observe the second stage of Kondo screening.\n\nA careful observer can note that the $T^*(x)$ dependency is not symmetrical; note for example different \n$T^*$ for $x=\\pm 0.5$ in \\fig{x}(a). This is caused by the dependence of the first stage Kondo temperature\n$T_K$ on $\\GS{1}$ \\cite{part1,DomanskiIW},\n\\beq\n\\widetilde{T}_K(\\GS{1}) = T_K \\cdot \\exp\\!\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\GS{1}^2}{\\Gamma U}\\right).\n \\end{equation} \nHere, $T_K$ is, as earlier, defined in the absence of SC, while $\\widetilde{T}_K$ is a function \nof $\\GS{1}$, such that $G(\\widetilde{T}_K) = G_{\\rm max}(\\GS{1})\/2$ in the absence of QD2. \nAs $\\widetilde{T}_K$ grows for increasing $\\GS{1}$ (or $x$), $T^*$ decreases according to \\eq{Tstar}. \nIts $\\GS{}$ dependence can be accounted for by small changes in the coefficients $a$ and $b$ in \\eq{Tstar}, \nas long as $x$ is kept constant. \n\nTo close the discussion of $T^*(x)$ dependence let us point out, that in \\eq{A_J} \nthere appears a correction to \\eq{Jeff} for $x\\neq 0$. However, it is very small due to additional\nfactor $\\GS{}^2\/U^2$ in the leading order. Its influence on curves plotted in \\fig{x}(b) is hardly visible.\n\nIn turn, let us examine the $x$ dependence of the $T=0$ conductance $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$. As can be seen \nin \\fig{x}(a), it monotonically increases with $x$, as it crosses $x=0$ point. In fact, \\eq{Gmin}\ncan be generalized to\n\\beq\nG_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\cdot c \\, \\frac{\\GS{1}^2}{U^2} ,\n\\label{Gmin2}\n \\end{equation} \nwith $c\\approx 2.25$ (indicated by a dotted line in \\fig{x}(c)). Note that $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ is proportional to \n$\\GS{1}^2=(x+1)^2 \\GS{}^2$, instead of simply $\\GS{}$, cf. \\eq{Gmin}. The values of $G_{\\mathrm{min}}$ obtained\nfrom all analyzed $G(T)$ dependencies for different $x$ have been compiled in \\fig{x}(c).\nIt is evident, that \\eq{Gmin2} is approximately fulfilled for all the considered cases.\n\nFinally, it seems noteworthy that the normal-lead coupling asymmetry, \n$\\Gamma_{\\rm L}\\neq \\Gamma_{\\rm R}$, is irrelevant for the results except for a constant factor\ndiminishing the conductance $G$ \\cite{KWIWJB-asym}.\n\n\n\n\\section{The role of CAR efficiency}\n\\label{sec:coef}\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{Fig6.pdf}\n\\caption{Linear conductance between the normal leads\n\t\t $G$ as a function of coupling to SC lead, $\\GS{}$, for indicated values of RKKY exchange $J$\n\t\t and the efficiency of CAR processes reduced by factor (a) $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$ and (b) $\\mathcal{C}=0.5$.\n\t\t Other parameters as in \\fig{3}.\n\t\t Insets: QD1 local spectral density $\\mathcal{A}(\\omega)$ as a function of energy $\\omega$\n\t\t for points on $J=-0.1U$ curve, indicated with corresponding symbols.\n\t\t} \n\\label{fig:C}\n\\end{figure}\n\nUp to this point we assumed $\\GS{\\rm X} = \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$, which is valid when the two \nquantum dots are much closer to each other than the coherence length in the superconductor.\nThis does not have to be the case in real setups, yet relaxing this assumption does not \nintroduce qualitative changes. Nevertheless, the model cannot be extended to inter-dot \ndistances much larger than the coherence length, where $\\GS{\\rm X}\\to 0$.\n\nTo quantitatively analyze the consequences of less effective Andreev coupling we define the \nCAR efficiency as $\\mathcal{C} \\equiv \\GS{\\rm X} \/ \\sqrt{\\GS{1}\\GS{2}}$ and analyze $\\mathcal{C} < 1$\nin the wide range of $\\GS{1}=\\GS{2}=\\GS{}$ and other parameters corresponding to \\fig{3}. \nThe results are presented in \\fig{C}.\n\nClearly, decreasing $\\mathcal{C}$ from $\\mathcal{C}=1$ causes diminishing of $\\GS{\\rm X}$, and consequently of CAR \nexchange. For a change as small as $\\mathcal{C}=0.9$, the consequences reduce to some shift of the \nconventional Kondo regime, compare \\fig{C}(a) with \\fig{3}. Stronger suppression of CAR may, \nhowever, increase the SC coupling necessary to observe the second stage of Kondo screening caused\nby CAR outside the experimentally achievable range, see \\fig{C}(b). Moreover, the reduced $T^*$\nleads to narrowing of the related local spectral density dip, while the\nincreased critical $\\GS{}$ necessary for the observation of the second stage of screening leads to the\nshallowing of the dip. This is visible especially in the inset in \\fig{C}(b).\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\nThe CAR exchange mechanism is present in any system comprising at least\ntwo QDs or magnetic impurities coupled to the same superconducting contact\nin a way allowing for crossed Andreev reflections.\nIn the considered setup, comprised of two quantum dots in a T-shaped geometry \nwith respect to normal leads and proximized by superconductor,\nit leads to the two-stage Kondo\nscreening even in the absence of other exchange mechanisms.\nThis CAR induced exchange screening is characterized by a residual \nlow-temperature conductance at particle-hole symmetric case.\nWe have also shown that the competition between CAR exchange and RKKY\ninteraction may result in completely different Kondo screening scenarios.\n\nThe presented results bring further insight into the low-temperature\nbehavior of hybrid coupled quantum dot systems, which hopefully could be verified\nwith the present-day experimental techniques.\nMoreover, non-local pairing is present also in bulk systems such as non-$s$-wave superconductors.\nThe question if an analogue of discussed CAR exchange may play a role there\nseems intriguing in the context of tendencies of many strongly correlated materials\nto possess superconducting and anti-ferromagnetic phases.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nThis work was supported by the National Science Centre in Poland through project no.\n2015\/19\/N\/ST3\/01030.\nWe thank J.

Space Monster) is a 1965 low budget black-and-white  science fiction\/action\/drama film from American International Pictures, written and directed by Leonard Katzman, and starring Francine York, James E. Brown, Baynes Barrow, and Russ Fender.\n\nPlot\nIn the late 20th century, when crewed missions to outer space have become routine, a distress call from the spaceship Faith One requests its immediate destruction. It has been contaminated by an infectious gas, leaving all crew dead except for its commander (Bob Legionaire). The mission is aborted and the spaceship is destroyed.By 2000, a new propulsion technology has been developed. Four astronauts aboard the spaceship Hope One set off to find new planets for colonization. Their mission takes them past a space platform circling Earth. General Mark Tillman (James Macklin) at Earth Control HQ tells a TV reporter (John Willis) that all is going according to the pre-flight plan.\nThe crew of gravity-controlled Hope One consists of the pilot\/commanding officer, Colonel Hank Stevens (James Brown), and three scientists: Dr. John Andros (Baynes Barron), Dr. Paul Martin (Russ Bender), and Dr. Lisa Wayne (Francine York). It is quickly revealed that Stevens did not want a woman on the mission, but he is stuck with Dr. Wayne anyway.\nNot long into their voyage, Hope One comes upon an unknown spacecraft. Earth Control instructs them to investigate and they encounter a grotesque alien. The alien attacks Dr. Andros, forcing Stevens to shoot and kill it. Radiation levels then rise on the alien spacecraft, so Stevens sets a bomb to blow it up.\nAfter a fiery meteorite storm leads to an emergency landing in the ocean of an Earth-like escaped moon, Tillman takes time to apologize to Wayne for his sexist remarks, which results in a quick reconciliation and a more-than-friendly kiss. While repairs continue, giant crabs take an interest in the spaceship. The crew decides to test the atmosphere to see if it contains breathable air, which it does. Andros then volunteers to go scout the nearest land mass. A sea monster almost intercepts him, but the scientist reaches shore, while his comrades continue repairs and worry about him. Upon his return, Andros is again attacked by the sea monster and, after making it back safely to the spaceship, perishes after confirming that the planet can support human life and plants can grow. The crew confirms this to Earth, names the planet Andros One, and rockets back safely to Earth.\n\nCast\nFrancine York as Dr. Lisa Wayne\nJames Brown as Col.

He was most notable for being the showrunner of the CBS oil soap opera Dallas.\n\nEarly life and career\nLeonard Katzman was born in New York City on September 2, 1927, to a Jewish family. He began his career in the 1940s, while still in his teens, working as an assistant director for his uncle, Hollywood producer Sam Katzman. He started out on adventure movie serials such as Brenda Starr, Reporter (1945), Superman (1948), Batman and Robin (1949), The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd (1951), Riding with Buffalo Bill (1954), et al. During the 1950s he continued working as assistant director, mostly with his uncle, in feature films such as A Yank in Korea (1951), The Giant Claw (1957), Face of a Fugitive (1959) and Angel Baby (1961). Besides his big screen work, Katzman also served on television shows, including The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, The Mickey Rooney Show and Bat Masterson.\nIn 1960, Katzman made his production debut, serving not only as assistant director, but also as associate producer, on all four seasons of adventure drama Route 66 (1960-1964), which he would later regard as his favorite production. His additional early work in television production (and occasional writing and directing) includes shows crime drama Tallahassee 7000 (1961), western drama The Wild Wild West (1965-1969), the second season of crime drama Hawaii Five-O (1969-1970), legal drama Storefront Lawyers (1970-1971), the final five seasons of western drama Gunsmoke (1970-1975) as well as its spinoff series Dirty Sally (1974), legal drama Petrocelli (1974-1976) for which he was nominated an Edgar Allan Poe Award, and the two science fiction dramas The Fantastic Journey (1977) and Logan's Run (1977-1978). In 1965, he wrote, produced and directed the science fiction film Space Probe Taurus (also known as Space Monster). Aside from his work as assistant director, this was his only venture into feature films.\n\nDallas\nIn 1978, Katzman served as producer for the five-part miniseries Dallas, which would evolve into one of television's longest running dramas, lasting until 1991. While the series was created by David Jacobs, Katzman became the de facto show runner during the second season of the show, as Jacobs stepped down to create and later run Dallas spin-off series Knots Landing. Under Katzman's lead, Dallas, whose first episodes had consisted of self-contained stories, evolved into a serial, leading into the '80s trend of prime time soap operas.While Katzman headed Dallas' writing staff from the show's second season, he remained producer, with Philip Capice serving as executive producer. The creative conflicts between Capice and Katzman eventually led to Katzman stepping down from his production duties on the show for season nine, instead being billed as \"creative consultant\" (during this time he also worked on the short-lived drama series Our Family Honor). However, increased production costs and decreasing ratings caused production company Lorimar\u2014along with series star Larry Hagman (J. R. Ewing)\u2014to ask Katzman to return to the show in his old capacity. Katzman agreed, reportedly under the condition that he would have \"total authority\" on the show, and as of the tenth season premiere he was promoted to executive producer, and Capice was let go.\nKatzman remained as executive producer on Dallas until the series finale in May 1991. Besides his production work, he also wrote and directed more episodes of the series than anyone else.\n\nAfter Dallas\nFollowing \"Dallas\", Katzman went on to create the short-lived crime drama Dangerous Curves (1992-1993), which aired as a part of CBS' late-night drama block Crimetime After Primetime, and serve as executive producer for the second season of the action drama Walker, Texas Ranger (1994-1995). His last work was the 1996 \"Dallas\" reunion movie J.R. Returns, which he also wrote and directed.\n\nPersonal life and death\nKatzman fathered his first child, Gary Katzman, with Eileen Leener (1929-2019). Katzman did not raise his first child and left his mother when he was 4 years old. The child was eventually adopted and took the surname Klein. Through Gary Klein, Katzman is the biological grandfather of Ethan Klein of the Israeli-American YouTube comedy channel h3h3Productions.Leonard Katzman and his wife LaRue Farlow Katzman  had three children. His daughter, actress Sherril Lynn Rettino (1956-1995), predeceased her father by one year. She played the recurring character Jackie Dugan on Dallas from 1979-91. His sons Mitchell Wayne Katzman and Frank Katzman, as well as son-in-law John Rettino, all worked on the production of Dallas' later seasons. Both sons were also involved in the production of Dangerous Curves; Walker, Texas Ranger; and J. R. Returns.\nKatzman died of a heart attack in Malibu, California on September 5, 1996, three days after his 69th birthday, and more than two months prior to the airing of his last production, Dallas: J.R. Returns. He was interred in the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nFilmography\nExcluding work as assistant director.\n\nAwards\n1997: Lone Star Film & Television Awards - Special Award\nPassage 8:\nThomas Ford\nThomas or Tom Ford may refer to:\n\nThomas Ford (martyr) (died 1582), English martyr\nThomas Ford (composer) (c. 1580\u20131648), English composer, lutenist, and viol player\nThomas Ford (minister) (1598\u20131674), English nonconformist minister\nThomas Ford (politician) (1800\u20131850), governor of Illinois\nThomas Ford (rower), British rower\nThomas H.

To solve these kinds of problems, time-consuming stepby-step numerical integration methods and convolution methods based on Volterra series in the time domain have been widely used.\nIn contrast, this work develops an efficient generalized pole-residue method based on the Volterra series performed in the Laplace domain. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method.\nCompared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the pole-residue method in this paper is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Because the proposed method derives an explicit, continuous response function of time, it is much more efficient than traditional numerical methods.\nUnlike the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the natural response, forced response and cross response are naturally obtained in the solution procedure, meaningful mathematical and physical insights are gained. In numerical studies, systems with a known equation of motion and an unknown equation of motion are investigated.\nFor each system, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters are studied. Numerical studies validate the good accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost real dynamic systems, as encountered in mechanical and civil engineering, are inherently nonlinear and include geometric nonlinearities, nonlinear constitutive relations in material or nonlinear resistances, etc. . Nonlinear problems are attracting increasing attention from engineers and scientists.\nThis work focuses on solving nonlinear system vibration problems, i.e., computing transient responses of nonlinear oscillators under arbitrary irregular excitations based on a combination of a pole-residue operation and Volterra series. Because Volterra series are single-valued, the scope of the present study is restricted to nonlinear behaviours without bifurcations .\nTo analyse nonlinear vibration problems, researchers have performed extensive studies and developed various mathematical methods. Popular methods include step-by-step numerical integration methods in the time domain, such as the Runge-Kutta method. This kind of method not only requires a small time-step resolution for obtaining high-precision solutions but also is prone to numerical instability .\nFor a long response with small time steps, the time domain methods are very costly in computational time. Volterra series is another widely used method, which is the extension of the Duhamel integral for linear systems . Volterra series can reproduce many nonlinear phenomena, but they are very complex due to higher-dimensional convolution integrals .\nSince 1980's, significant progress has been made in the general area of the Volterra series. The reader is referred to Ref. for a quite thorough literature review on the relevant topics. After 2017, most papers focus on Volterra series identification. De Paula and Marques proposed a method for the identification of Volterra kernels, which was based on time-delay neural networks.\nSon and Kim presented a method for a direct estimation of the Volterra kernel coefficients. Dalla Libera et al. introduced two new kernels for Volterra series identification. Peng et al. used the measured response to identify the kernel function and performed the nonlinear structural damage detection. Only a few papers concentrated on simplifying the computation of convolution integrals.\nTraditional methods for computing convolution integrals involved in the Volterra series have been performed in three distinct domains: time, frequency and Laplace. The time domain method based on Volterra series refers to discrete time convolution methods, which also suffer computational cost problems .\nBoth the frequency domain method and the Laplace domain method based on the Volterra series consist of three steps: (1) Volterra series are transformed into an algebraic equation in the frequency domain or Laplace domain; the algebraic equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations; and (3) the solution in Step ( ) is transformed back to the time domain.\nMany researchers have used the frequency domain method to compute the responses of nonlinear systems. Billings et al. developed a new method for identifying the generalized frequency response function (GFRF) of nonlinear systems and then predicted the nonlinear response based on these GFRFs. Carassale et al. introduced a frequency domain approach for nonlinear bridge aerodynamics and aeroelasticity.\nHo et al. computed an output frequency domain function of a nonlinear damped duffing system modelled by a Volterra series under a sinusoidal input. Kim et al. identified the higher order frequency response functions by using the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input technique and the harmonic probing method.\nThis type of frequency domain method is much more efficient than the time domain method due to the fast Fourier transform algorithm. However, the frequency domain method not only is limited by frequency resolutions but also suffers from leakage problems due to the use of discrete Fourier transforms. In addition, the frequency domain method calculates only a steady-state response.\nA natural response generated by initial conditions and a cross response caused by interactions between a system and an excitation are ignored. In contrast, the Laplace domain method can calculate all response components because initial conditions are considered in the computational procedure. However, it has been restricted to analytical operations for simple excitations, such as sinusoidal excitations and exponential excitations .\nThe proposed method falls into the category of the Volterra series method computed in the Laplace domain. Unlike the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the proposed method follows a similar path as a pole-residue method for linear systems , the proposed method to solve nonlinear system vibration problems is called the generalized pole-residue method.\nThe main concept of the pole-residue method developed by Hu et al. was that the poles and residues of the response could be easily obtained from those of the input and system transfer function to obtain the closed-form response solution of linear systems. This method included three steps: (1) writing the system transfer function into pole-residue form; (2) writing the excitation into pole-residue form by the Prony-SS method; (3) computing the poles and residues of the response by an algebraic operation based on those from system and excitation.\nCompared to Hu et al. , which was regarded as an efficient tool to compute responses of linear systems, the generalized pole-residue method in this paper is introduced to compute responses of nonlinear systems. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of the pole-residue method.\nCompared to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the generalized pole-residue method is how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients. Similar to the Taylor series, the Volterra series representation is an infinite series, and convergence conditions are needed to assure that the representation is meaningful.\nBecause the proposed method is based on the Volterra series, only the system with convergent Volterra series representation can be treated by the proposed method. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinear response is modelled by a Volterra series, and Volterra kernel functions are decoupled by Laguerre polynomials.\nThen, the pole-residue method for computing explicit responses is developed in Section 3. Numerical studies and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n\nResponse calculation based on Volterra series\n\nA nonlinear oscillator, whose governing equation of motion is given by where z(t, y, \u1e8f) represents an arbitrary nonlinear term; m, c, and k are the mass, damping and linear stiffness, respectively; y(t), \u1e8f(t) and \u00ff(t) are the displacement, velocity and acceleration, respectively; and f (t) is the time-dependent excitation.\nIf the energy of excitation f (t) is limited, the nonlinear response under zero initial conditions (i.e., zero displacement and zero velocity) can be represented by the Volterra series : where N is the order of Volterra series and In Eq. 3, h 1 (\u03c4 ) is called the first-order Volterra kernel function, which represents the linear behaviour of the system; h n (\u03c4 1 , . . .\n, \u03c4 n ) for n > 1 are the higher-order Volterra kernel functions, which describe the nonlinear behaviour of the system. The complete formulation of y(t) includes infinite series where the labour of calculating the n th term increases quickly with the growth of n. Fortunately, the response accuracy may be ensured by the first several order Volterra series.\nThis is proved here in numerical studies. The commonly known Laguerre polynomials are represented as : where p i is the order of the Laguerre polynomials and a i is the damping rate. The Laguerre polynomials satisfy the orthogonal relationship expressed as: By using Laguerre polynomials, the Volterra kernel function h n (t 1 , . . .\n, t n ) in Eq. 3 can be decoupled as follows : where the coefficient is computed resorting to the orthogonal relationship in Eq. 5: Substituting Eq. 6 into Eq. 3 yields . . . The above operation that uses the Laguerre polynomials to decouple Volterra higher order kernel functions has been well-developed.\nThe reader is referred to Refs. for details about the adopted technique. After decoupling Volterra higher order kernel functions in time, one can regroup Eq. 8 into: . . . By denoting Eq. 9 becomes The above procedure to compute the nonlinear response by a combination of Volterra series and Laguerre polynomials is schematically shown in Fig. .\nVolterra kernel functions h n (t 1 , . . . , t n ) can be obtained by either an equation of motion or measured input-output signals. To derive a closedform solution of the response, we must obtain a closed-form solution of x i (t) first. In the following presentation, a closed-form solution of the aforementioned x i (t) and y n (t) is derived by using the pole-residue method.\n3. Pole-residue method for calculating x i (t) and y n (t) Performing the Laplace transform of x i (t) in Eq. 10 yields where in which Eq. 13 includes a single pole and several higher-order poles. For k = 0, \u2212a i is a single pole, and b p i (0) is a corresponding coefficient, namely, the residue. For k > 0, \u2212a i are higher-order poles, and b p i (k) are corresponding coefficients.\nFor an irregular excitation signal f (t) of a finite duration of T , it can always be approximated into a pole-residue form by using the complex exponential signal decomposition method-Prony-SS : where N \u2113 is the number of components; \u03b1 \u2113 and \u03bb \u2113 are constant coefficients, which either are real numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs.\nWe define \u03bb \u2113 = \u2212\u03b4 \u2113 + i\u2126 \u2113 , where \u2126 \u2113 is the excitation frequency and \u03b4 \u2113 is the damping factor of the \u2113 th component. We denote \u03b1 \u2113 = A \u2113 e i\u03b8 \u2113 , where A \u2113 is the amplitude and \u03b8 \u2113 is the sinusoidal initial phase in radians. Taking the Laplace transform of Eq. 15 yields Note that the concept of the Prony-SS method is similar to that of a principal component method.\nA smooth excitation usually requires just several terms to achieve a good approximation. For high irregular loadings, including more terms would achieve a better approximation. Substituting Eqs. 13 and 16 into Eq. 12 yields Expressing xi (s) in its pole-residue form yields where \u03bb \u2113 are simple poles, and the corresponding residues are easily obtained by\nand \u2212a i are higher-order poles, and the corresponding coefficients are firstly derived as: By taking the inverse Laplace transform of Eq. 18, a closed-form solution is obtained: Substituting Eqs. 11 and 21 into Eq. 2 yields Theoretically speaking, the proposed method for deriving the closed-form solution of the nonlinear response is applicable to any order of the Volterra series.\nFor practical engineering, usually only the first several order responses dominate. By setting up N = 2, Eq. 22 can be simplified into three components: where the natural response, which is only related to system poles, is given by and the cross response, which is related to both system poles and excitation poles, is given by\nand the forced response, which is related only to excitation poles, is given by The first term in Eq. 26 is the first-order forced response governed by the excitation frequency, i.e., the imaginary part of the pole \u03bb \u2113 . The second term corresponds to the second-order nonlinear forced response, which includes the sum frequency and difference frequency responses governed by \u03bb \u2113 + \u03bb j .\nEq. 26 straightforwardly offers visible information about the possible nonlinear vibrations by the cooperation of excitation frequencies. Particularly, consider a sinusoidal excitation f (t) = sin \u03c9 r t, which can be expressed as f (t) = \u03b3e \u03bbt + \u03b3 * e \u03bb * t , where \u03b3 = \u22120.5i and \u03bb = i\u03c9 r . Substituting these values into Eq.\n26, the second term of Eq. 26 is simplified as where the first term is the difference frequency response, and the second term is the sum frequency response.\n\nNumerical studies\n\nIn practical engineering, some systems have an accurate equation of motion. Additionally, some systems have difficulty constructing their equations of motion because of complex nonlinear dynamic behaviours and uncertain system parameters. In this article, a system with a known equation of motion is called a known system, and a system with an unknown equation of motion is called an unknown system for simplicity.\nIn this section, two numerical studies are presented. The first study verifies the proposed method using a known nonlinear oscillator, and the second study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method to an unknown system. Throughout the numerical studies, the unit system is the metre-kilogramme-second (MKS) system; for conciseness, explicit units for quantities are omitted.\n\nA known nonlinear system\n\nThis study chooses a nonlinear oscillator written as: where mass m = 1, damping c = 1, linear stiffness k 1 = 10, quadratic stiffness k 2 = 20 and cubic stiffness k 3 = 20. It is a case that has been studied in a previously published article . The linear natural frequency of the system \u03c9 0 = k 1 \/m = 3.16 and the damping ratio \u03b6 = c\/(2m\u03c9 0 ) = 15.8%.\nThis kind of oscillator occurs in many engineering problems, such as a model of fluid resonance in a narrow gap between large vessels . In the model, k 1 y represents the linear restoring force of the fluid, and k 2 y 2 and k 3 y 3 are respectively the quadratic and cubic nonlinear restoring forces of the fluid.\n\nVolterra kernel functions\n\nGenerally, the first several order responses dominate the total response of a system. Hence, the order of the Volterra series in Eq. 22 is chosen to be 3, namely, N = 3. For computing the first three order responses from Eq. 22, the first three order Volterra kernel functions need to be known. Since Volterra kernel functions and corresponding frequency response functions are related by a specific Fourier transform pair, we can first write the first three orders of frequency response functions directly from Eq. 28.\nThen, Volterra kernel functions are obtained by the inverse Fourier transform. Based on the harmonic probing algorithm , the linear frequency response function (LFRF) H 1 (\u03c9), the quadratic frequency response function (QFRF) H 2 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 ) and the cubic frequency response function (CFRF) H 3 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 3 ) are analytically given by:\nand Figures show H 1 (\u03c9), H 2 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 ) and H 3 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 3 ), respectively, which agree well with those reported in Ref. . As expected, the modulus of H 1 (\u03c9) in Fig. peaks near the linear natural frequency \u03c9 0 , and the phase angle decreases monotonically from 0 to -\u03c0 with increasing frequency.\nFigure shows the sum frequency QFRF, where the energy converges along the line of \u03c9 1 +\u03c9 2 \u2248 \u03c9 0 . Therefore, when the sum frequency of a two-tone excitation equals the linear resonant frequency, the second-order response may reach its maximum. Additionally, those pairs of excitations in line \u03c9 1 + \u03c9 2 \u2248 \u03c9 0 may produce non-negligible vibration magnitudes due to second-order nonlinear effects.\nFor the difference frequency QFRF in Fig. (b), the energy converges along two main lines, i.e., \u03c9 1 \u2248 \u03c9 0 and \u03c9 2 \u2248 \u03c9 0 . Figures show moduli of H 3 (\u03c9, \u03c9, \u03c9) and H 3 (\u03c9, \u03c9, \u2212\u03c9), which are diagonal terms of the sum frequency CFRF and the difference frequency CFRF, respectively. While the modulus of H 3 (\u03c9, \u03c9, \u03c9) peaks near \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9 0 \/3 and \u03c9 0 , that of H 3 (\u03c9, \u03c9, \u2212\u03c9) peaks near \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9 0 with a small hump around \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9 0 \/2.\nValues at \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9 0 \/3 and \u03c9 0 \/2 may be magnified by higher-order stiffness terms in Eq. 28. By performing the inverse fast Fourier transform to Eqs. 29-31, the corresponding linear impulse response function h 1 (t), quadratic impulse response function h 2 (t 1 , t 2 ) and cubic impulse response function h 3 (t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ) are obtained.\nHere, h 1 (t) and h 2 (t 1 , t 2 ) are plotted in Figs. , respectively, and h 3 (t, t, t) is shown in Fig. . In the numerical implementation, Eqs. 29-31 have been utilized with the frequency interval \u2206\u03c9 = 0.1, number of frequency components N n = 1025, and cut-off frequencies 102.4 and \u2212102.4. For decoupling Volterra kernel functions by using Laguerre polynomials, the damping rate and number of Laguerre polynomials for each order Volterra kernel function need to be determined (see Eqs. 4 and 6).\nIn this example, we set a 1 = a 2 = a 3 = 2 and R 1 = R 2 = R 3 = 24 because coefficients c p 1 ...pn become very small when R n > 24, n = 1, 2, 3. According to Eq. 7, the coefficients of the first three order Volterra kernel functions are calculated, which are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. For convenience, Fig. plots only c p 1 p 2 p 3 for p 3 = 0.\nWith the increase of the order of Laguerre polynomials, coefficients in Figs. 9 and 10 gradually decrease, which illustrates how the first several orders of Laguerre polynomials dominate all orders of the Volterra kernel function. With the known Laguerre polynomials and corresponding coefficients, Volterra kernel functions are reconstructed by Eq. 6.\nFor comparison, reconstructed Volterra kernel functions are also plotted in Figs. . The reconstructed results agree well with the analytical values, which verifies the accuracy of the decomposition.\n\nSinusoidal excitation\n\nFrom Eq. 28, we consider a sinusoidal excitation where A and \u2126 are the amplitude and the frequency, respectively. Five cases of A and \u2126 are shown in Table . Excitation frequencies in Cases 1 and 2 are larger than the linear natural frequency (\u03c9 0 \u2248 3.16), those in Case 3 are very close to \u03c9 0 , and those in Cases 4 and 5 are smaller than \u03c9 0 .\nAll cases have same amplitudes. The poles of a sinusoidal excitation are \u03bb 1,2 = \u00b1i\u2126, and the residues are \u03b1 1,2 = \u2213iA\/2. Numerical values of excitation poles and residues for different cases are listed in Table . Table : Parameter values, poles and residues of the sinusoidal excitation Substituting poles and residues of the excitation, as well as those of the system into Eqs.\n20 and 19, response coefficients \u03b2 p i ,k corresponding to system poles \u2212a i and response coefficients \u03b3 p i ,\u2113 corresponding to excitation poles \u03bb \u2113 are calculated, respectively. According to Eq. 22, the first three orders of responses for each case in Table are calculated. Figures )-15(a) show the comparison of responses obtained by the proposed method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with \u2206t = 10 \u22124 .\nFor Cases 1 and 2, the first-order responses agree well with the total responses obtained by the Runge-Kutta method, and the higher-order responses only slightly improve the transient parts. For Cases 3-5, the sum of the first three orders of responses is in good agreement with the Runge-Kutta solution.\nWhen the response nonlinearity increases, higher-order responses need to be considered. In other words, the proposed method can accurately compute the nonlinear responses by choosing a small number N of Volterra series terms. Figures )-15(b) show the contributions of the three response components for the five cases.\nIn each case, the first-order response is the most dominant component, and the contributions of secondand third-order responses are much less than those of the first-order response. Especially for Cases 1 and 2, whose excitation frequencies are far from the linear natural frequency, second-and thirdorder responses are close to zero.\nThis may be because the QFRF and CFRF approach zero when the frequency is larger than 4 rad\/s (see Figs. ). Furthermore, the mean values of the first-order responses are approximately zero, and those of the second-order responses are always smaller than zero, which are the difference frequency components in Eq. 27.\nMoreover, it is clearly observed that second-order responses for Cases 3-5 exhibit a periodic oscillation with a period near half of that for the first-order response, which is excited by the sum frequency component of the excitation (see second part of Eq. 27). Compared with steady-state solutions of first-and second-order responses, those of third-order responses in Cases 3-5 are no longer single regular motions.\nBy performing the FFT, frequency spectra of these three third-order responses are shown in Fig. . We find that these three third-order responses are all dominated by their own fundamental harmonic component and the third harmonic (triple frequency) component. Figure shows the computational time to calculate the response of the oscillator for Case 1 by the proposed method, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and the convolution method.\nThe proposed method, which has an explicit solution, is much more efficient in computational time than the latter two methods, which need small time steps to obtain high-precision solutions. In particular, the efficiency of the proposed method increases with the length of the response time. Computation time (sec.)\nt=0.02s Convolution, t=0.02s Convolution, t=0.001s Runge-Kutta, t=0.001s Fig. : Comparison of computation efficiency of the proposed method, the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method and the convolution method regular loading in Case 1\n\nIrregular excitation\n\nIn Eq. 28, considering an irregular excitation consisting of several cosine functions where N f is the number of cosine components; A n , \u2126 n and \u03b8 n are the amplitude, frequency and phase angle of the n th component, respectively. Table lists three cases of these parameters. In each case, the amplitudes of all components are the same, and phase angles \u03b8 n uniformly distributed between 0 and 2\u03c0 are randomly generated.\nTo decompose the excitation into a pole-residue form, the Prony-SS method is used, whose concept is similar to that of a principal component method. The readers are referred to Ref. for details. The chosen rank of each case is also shown in Table . Figure shows the comparison of original excitations and reconstructed results of these three cases, which all have excellent agreement.\nshow the results computed by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. In all cases, the sums of the first three orders of responses agree well with those obtained by the Runge-Kutta method. The contributions of the first three orders of responses for each case are plotted in Figs. )-21(b). Similarly, the system vibration is dominated by the first-order response.\nHowever, the contributions of second-and third-order significantly grow with increasing excitation magnitude and frequency number. Furthermore, when the magnitude of the nonlinear response becomes large, sharp troughs are present. This phenomenon may be induced by the nonlinear stiffness. While the first-order response fails to capture these troughs, the higher-order responses successfully capture these troughs.\nFigure plots the computational time to calculate the response of the oscillator for the irregular loading in Case 1 by the proposed method and the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method, respectively. While the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method is more efficient under a small response length, the proposed method becomes much more efficient when the response length is larger than about 130 s.\nIn addition, the proposed method obtains the explicit response solution, so one can directly obtain the response value at a specific time t p instead of integrating from 0 to t p for traditional numerical methods. Computation time (sec.) Proposed, t=0.02s Runge-Kutta, t=0.001s Fig. : Comparison of computation efficiency of the method and the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method for irregular loading in Case 1\n\nAn unknown nonlinear\n\nTo check the applicability of the proposed method to an unknown nonlinear system, a known input excitation and its corresponding response are used to identify its Volterra kernel functions. When the Volterra kernel functions are known, we can follow the procedure in Section 4.1 to predict system responses.\nIn this study, the input excitation is white noise with a constant power spectrum S 0 = 0.001, and the corresponding response is obtained by solving Eq. 28 by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, which is shown in Fig. . From Section 4.1, we determine that the sum of the first two orders of responses agrees well with the total response.\nIn this study, the order of Volterra series N is chosen to be 2, damping rates of Laguerre polynomials are a 1 = a 2 = 2, and numbers of Laguerre polynomials are R 1 = R 2 = 24. To estimate the first two orders of Volterra kernel functions, a matrix equation is constructed using excitation data and response data.\nBy using the least square method to solve this matrix equation, coefficients c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 in Eq. 8 are identified. Figure plots c p 1 and c p 1 p 2 , respectively, which have good agreement with the exact results in Fig. . Then, the first two order Volterra kernel functions are constructed by Eq. 6.\nCompared with the exact results in Figs. , the identified Volterra kernel functions in Fig. completely agree well with the exact solutions. Note that the white noise excitation, which can excite more frequency components of the response, is chosen to obtain good Volterra kernel functions. A regular excitation f (t) = sin(\u03c0t) and an irregular excitation f (t) = N f n=1 A n cos(\u2126 n t + \u03b8 n ) with A n = 0.3 and \u2126 n varying from 0 to 40 with equal interval 1 are chosen as input excitations.\nThe predicted responses, along with results obtained by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, are shown in Fig. . In both cases, the proposed method accurately predicts system responses. As presented in Eq. 23, a nonlinear response is the sum of three terms: natural response y s (t), forced response y f (t) and cross response y c (t).\nThese individual terms, as well as their sum to two excitations, are shown in Figs. 27 and 28, respectively. As shown in Figs. and 28, both first-and second-order responses include the natural response y s (t) and the forced response y f (t), but the cross response y c (t) only exists in second-order responses.\nWhen t becomes larger, both y s (t) and y c (t) diminish due to the presence of system damping, and the total response is entirely governed by y f (t). Moreover, we notice some features at t = 0 for these components, including y s (0) = \u2212y f (0) for the first-order response and y s (0) + y f (0) = \u2212y c (0) for the second-order response, which are due to imposed zero initial conditions.\n\nConclusions\n\nConsidering arbitrary irregular excitations, an efficient generalized pole-residue method to compute the nonlinear dynamic response modelled by the Volterra series was developed. A core of the proposed method was obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, then those of each order response modelled by each order Volterra series.\nOnce the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions and excitations were both available, the remaining derivation could follow a similar pole-residue method that had been developed for ordinary linear oscillators. To obtain the poles and corresponding coefficients of Volterra kernel functions, two steps were included: (1) using Laguerre polynomials to decouple higher-order Volterra kernel functions with respect to time and (2) obtaining poles and corresponding coefficients of Laguerre polynomials in the Laplace domain.\nBecause the proposed method gave an explicit, continuous response function of time, it was much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Moreover, many meaningful physical and mathematical insights were gained because not only each order response but also the natural response, the forced response and the cross response of each order were obtained in the solution procedure.\nTo demonstrate that the proposed method was not only suitable for a system with a known equation of motion but also applicable to a system with an unknown equation of motion, two numerical studies were conducted. For each study, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters were investigated.\nThe efficiency of the proposed method was verified by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. This paper only computes the response under zero initial conditions. The response under non-zero initial conditions will be investigated in our future work.","label":"longbench","length":7000,"title":"Paper Info"}

{"context":"Passage 1:\nBaranya County\nBaranya (Hungarian: Baranya v\u00e1rmegye, pronounced [\u02c8b\u0252r\u0252\u0272\u0252 \u02c8va\u02d0rm\u025b\u025f\u025b]; German: Branau; Croatian: Baranjska \u017eupanija) is a county (v\u00e1rmegye) in southern Hungary. It is part of the Southern Transdanubia statistical region and the historical Baranya region, which was a county (comitatus) in the Kingdom of Hungary dating back to the 11th century. Its current status as one of the 19 counties of Hungary was established in 1950 as part of wider Soviet administrative territorial reform following World War II. It is bordered by Somogy County to the northwest, Tolna County to the north, B\u00e1cs-Kiskun County and the Danube to the east, and the border with Croatia (part of which is formed by the Drava River) to the south.\nAs of the 2011 census, it had a population of 386,441 residents. Of the 19 counties of Hungary (excluding Budapest), it is ranked 10th by both geographic area and population. Its county seat and largest city is P\u00e9cs.\n\nEtymology\nIn German, it is known as Komitat Branau, and in Croatian as Baranjska \u017eupanija (Baranja).\nThe county was probably named after its first comes 'Brana' or 'Braina'.\n\nGeography\nThis county has a total area of 4,430 km2 (1,710 sq mi) \u2013 4.76% of Hungary, it is divided in Upper Baranya and Lower Baranya.\nThe northern part of the county is a mountain area with large forests, the Mecsek Mountains. The central areas are shared between the Baranya Hills and Vill\u00e1ny Mountains. The very eastern and southern parts are flat.\nThe highest point in the county is Zeng\u0151 in the Mecsek Mountains, at 682 metres. This is also the highest point of the mountain range.\nBaranya is rich in mineral and thermal water, and also in other resources. 98% of Hungary's coal resources are found here.\n\nNeighbours\nTolna County in the North.\nB\u00e1cs-Kiskun County in the East. (across the Danube river)\nCroatia in the south (across the Drava river) \u2013 Osijek-Baranja County and Virovitica-Podravina County\nSomogy County in the Northwest.\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Baranya is a mix of continental and temperate, which makes it unique in Hungary, as the rest of the country is primarily continental. Its milder climate is due to its southern location and relative proximity to the Mediterranean Sea in comparison to other parts of the country, leaving it with warmer winters. It has the highest average annual rainfall of the Hungarian counties and a high amount of sunshine hours.\n\nHistory\nThe area has been inhabited since ancient times. Before the Hungarian tribes conquered the area, it was inhabited by Slavs and Avars. Stephen I founded an episcopal seat here.\nIn 1526, the county was occupied by Ottomans and was freed in 1689. Its medieval borders remained unchanged until 1919. According to the peace treaty of Trianon, the southern part of the county (1,163 km2, 449 sq mi) reverted to Slavic rule (present-day Croatia). The re-organizing of the counties (1950) brought only minor changes (town of Szigetv\u00e1r got there).\nBaranya has the largest number of minorities in Hungary (more than twice the country average), providing home to 34% of the German minority the so-called Danube Swabians, and 32% of the Southern Slav minorities in Hungary.\nThe Stifolder or Stiffoller Shvove are a Roman Catholic subgroup of the so-called Danube Swabians. Their ancestors once came ca. 1717 - 1804 from the Hochstift Fulda and surroundings, (Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda), and settled in the Baranya. They retained their own German dialect and culture, until the end of WW2. After WW2, the majority of Danube Swabians were expelled to allied-occupied Germany and allied-occupied Austria as a result of the Potsdam Agreement.Only a few people can speak the old Stiffolerisch Schvovish dialect. Also a salami is named after these people. Electoral History\n\nDemographics\nIn 2015, it had a population of 371,110 and the population density was 84\/km2.\n\n2011 census\nAs of the census of 2011, there were 386,441 residents, 160,040 households, and 105,646 families living in the county.

The gender makeup of the county was 47.2% male and 52.8% female.\nReligious adherence in the county was 46.8% Roman Catholic, 6.4% Reformed (Calvinist), 1.2% Evangelical (Lutheran), 0.3% Greek Catholic, 0.1% Orthodox, and 1.5% other religions. The non-religious were 16.2% and atheists were 1.5%, with 26.0% declining to answer.\n\n2001 census\nAs of the census of 2001, there were 407,448 residents, 151,956 households, and 115,946 families living in the county. The population density was 238 inhabitants per square mile (92\/km2). There were 156,632 housing units at an average density of 92 per square mile (35\/km2).\nThere were 151,956 households, of which 68.5% were one-family households, 3.8% were multi-family households, 24.9% were one-person households, and 2.7% were other non-family households. Elderly individuals living alone were 13.1% of all households. The average household size was 2.60.\nThere were 115,946 families, of which 48.7% were married couples or consensual unions living together with children, 35.4% were couples without children, 13.7% were single females with children, and 2.1% were single males with children.

The non-religious were 13.4%, with 10.8% declining to answer.\n\nEthnicity\nBesides the Hungarian majority, the main minorities are the Germans (approx. 22,000), Roma (17,000), Croats (6,000), and Serbs (500).\nTotal population (2011 census): 386,441\nEthnic groups (2011 census):\nIdentified themselves: 364,801 persons:\n\nHungarians: 315,713 (86.54%)\nGermans: 22,150 (6.07%)\nRomani: 16,995 (4.66%)\nCroats: 6,343 (1.74%)\nOthers and indefinable: 3,600 (0.99%)Approx. 58,000 persons in Baranya County did not declare their ethnic group at the 2011 census.\n\nRegional structure\nPolitics\nCounty Assembly\nThe Baranya County Council, elected at the 2019 local government elections, is made up of 18 counselors, with the following party composition:\n\nPresident of the Assembly\nMembers of the National Assembly\nThe following members elected of the National Assembly during the 2022 parliamentary election:\n\nMunicipalities\nBaranya County has 1 urban county, 13 towns, 3 large villages and 284 villages. There are 301 municipalities.\n\nLike Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n, Baranya is a county of extremes when it comes to regional structure. The county seat is one of the five largest cities (and three largest agglomerations) of Hungary, but more than 2\/3 of the municipalities are small hamlets with a population under 500. Half of the county's population lives in the county seat or in its immediate vicinity, while 22% of the population lives in villages that have less than 1000 inhabitants.\n\nCities with county rights(ordered by population, as of 2011 census)\n\nP\u00e9cs (156,049) \u2013 county seatTowns\nVillages\n municipalities are large villages.\n\nGallery\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nJohn C. Petersen\nJohn C. Petersen (November 2, 1842 \u2013 July 10, 1887) was an American butcher and farmer from Appleton, Wisconsin who served as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from Outagamie County. He was elected in 1878 as a Greenbacker, and was re-elected the next year as a \"Greenback Democrat\" (even though he was opposed by a Democrat).\n\nBackground\nPetersen was born in Gl\u00fcckstadt, Holstein-Gl\u00fcckstadt (now part of Germany but then ruled by the Kings of Denmark) on November 2, 1842. He received a common school education, and became a butcher by occupation. Petersen came to Wisconsin in 1862, and settled in Appleton, where he was elected to various township offices .\n\nPublic office\nPetersen was elected to the assembly for 1879 from Outagamie County's 1st Assembly district (The City of Appleton, and the Towns of Buchanan, Center, Freedom, Grand Chute and Kaukauna), receiving 1,096 votes against 1,000 for Republican B. T. Rogers (Rep.), and 423 for incumbent William Smith Warner (who had been elected as an \"Independent Democrat\" but was now the Democratic nominee). He was assigned to the standing committee on public improvements.He was re-elected for 1880 by 963 votes, against 779 for D. J. Brothers, a Democrat, and 434 for P. P. Wing, a Republican. Even though he was re-elected running against a Democrat, he is listed in the 1880 Wisconsin Blue Book as a \"Greenback Democrat\": there were 71 Republicans, 27 Democrats, Petersen (listed separately as \"Greenback Democrat\") and one Greenback (David Bean) listed in the Assembly roster for that year. He remained on the public improvements committee. Petersen was not a candidate for re-election for 1881, and was succeeded by Democrat Henry Clay Sloan.\n\nPersonal life\nPetersen married Wilhelmina \"Minnie\" Freiberg, born in Stettin, Pomerania in 1849; they were the parents of five children. Petersen was in the butcher business at Appleton for about twenty-five years, then moved to a farm in Grand Chute township which he operated until his retirement, and then returned to Appleton, where he died on July 10, 1887. His widow survived him, living until 1932. They are buried at Riverside Cemetery in Appleton.\nPassage 3:\nKoh Sotin District\nKoh Sotin (Khmer: \u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1780\u1780\u17c4\u17c7\u179f\u17bc\u1791\u17b7\u1793) is a district (srok) located in Kampong Cham province, Cambodia. The district capital is Chi Haer town located around 10 kilometres south of the provincial capital of Kampong Cham by water, but some 42 kilometres by road. The district borders on the southern bank of the Mekong River and includes the islands of Koh Sothin and Koh Mitt in its area.The district is easily accessed by boat from Kampong Cham. Road access however, is via 12 kilometres of secondary road to National road 11 and then a further 18 kilometres to the intersection with National Highway 7. From this intersection in Tbong Khmom district is it a further 12 kilometres west to the provincial capital. This small relatively narrow district follows the south bank of the Mekong for about 25 kilometres. As the district is low lying, much of the land area of the district is inundated when the Mekong rises during the wet season.\n\nAn unusual birth\nOn 11 November 2004, Koh Sotin was home to an unusual birth. A two headed calf was born to a local farmer and a rumour quickly spread that it was a miracle that might help students pass their upcoming exams. Hundreds of students flocked to burn incense and make offerings to the dead calf, hoping that the miracle might increase their brainpower. The farmer who owned the animal packed the dead body in ice to slow decomposition and take advantage of the windfall. Hopeful pilgrims were willing to pay anything from a few cents to a few dollars for an audience with the deceased bovine.\n\nLocation\nKoh Sotin district is in southern Kampong Cham Province. The Mekong runs along the northern border of the district and the district boundary includes the river itself to midstream. Reading from the north clockwise, Koh Sotin shares a border with Kang Meas and Kampong Siem districts to the north and the district of Kampong Cham to the north east. Tbong Khmom and Ou Reang Ou districts are to the east. To the south is Sithor Kandal district of Prey Veng province and Srei Santhor district lies on the western boundary.\n\nAdministration\nThe Koh Sotin district governor reports to Hun Neng, the Governor of Kampong Cham. The following table shows the villages of Koh Sotin district by commune.\n\nDemographics\nThe district is subdivided into 8 communes (khum) and 85 villages (phum). According to the 1998 Census, the population of the district was 70,672 persons in 14,187 households in 1998. With a population of over 70,000 people, Koh Sotin has one of the smallest populations for districts in Kampong Cham province after Dambae and Kampong Cham districts. The average household size in Koh Sotin is 5.0 persons per household, which is slightly smaller than the rural average for Cambodia (5.2 persons). The sex ratio in the district is 89.6%, with significantly more females than males.\n\nTourism\nWat Moha Leap, the only wooden-frame pagoda still standing in Cambodia, is a popular touristic destination located in Koh Sotin District.\nPassage 4:\nList of capitals in the United States\nThis is a list of capital cities of the United States, including places that serve or have served as federal, state, insular area, territorial, colonial and Native American capitals.\nWashington has been the federal capital of the United States since 1800. Each U.S. state has its own capital city, as do many of its insular areas. Most states have not changed their capital city since becoming a state, but the capital cities of their respective preceding colonies, territories, kingdoms, and republics typically changed multiple times. There have also been other governments within the current borders of the United States with their own capitals, such as the Republic of Texas, Native American nations, and other unrecognized governments.\n\nNational capitals\nThe buildings in cities identified in below chart served either as official capitals of the United States under the United States Constitution, or, prior to its ratification, sites where the Second Continental Congress or Congress of the Confederation met. The United States did not have a permanent capital under the Articles of Confederation.\nThe U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1787, and gave the Congress the power to exercise \"exclusive legislation\" over a district that \"may, by Cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States.\" The 1st Congress met at Federal Hall in New York. In 1790, it passed the Residence Act, which established the national capital at a site along the Potomac River that would become Washington, D.C. For the next ten years, Philadelphia served as the temporary capital. There, Congress met at Congress Hall. On November 17, 1800, the 6th United States Congress formally convened in Washington, D.C. Congress has met outside of Washington only twice since: on July 16, 1987, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of ratification of the Constitution; and at Federal Hall National Memorial in New York on September 6, 2002, to mark the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Both meetings were ceremonial.\nOn July 2, 1923, President Warren G. Harding commented in a speech (or, as a historic marker tells it, \"reporters noted\")  that the little town of Meacham, Oregon, was the nation's capital \"all day long\".\n\nState capitals\nEach state has a capital that serves as the seat of its government. Ten of the thirteen original states and 15 other states have changed their capital city at least once; the last state to move its capital city was Oklahoma in 1910.\nIn the following table, the \"Since\" column shows the year that the city began serving as the state's capital (or the capital of the entities that preceded it). The MSA\/\u00b5SA and CSA columns display the population of the metro area the city is a part of, and should not be construed to mean the population of the city's sphere of influence or that the city is an anchor for the metro area. Fields colored light yellow denote that the population is a micropolitan statistical area.\n\nInsular area capitals\nAn insular area is a United States territory that is neither a part of one of the fifty states nor a part of the District of Columbia, the nation's federal district. Those insular areas with territorial capitals are listed below.\n\nFormer national capitals\nTwo of the 50 U.S. states, Hawaii and Texas, were once de jure sovereign states with diplomatic recognition from the international community.\n\nHawaii\nDuring its history as a sovereign nation (Kingdom of Hawaii, 1795\u20131893; Republic of Hawaii, 1894\u20131898), five sites served as the capital of Hawaii:\n\nWaik\u012bk\u012b, 1795\u20131796\nHilo, 1796\u20131803\nHonolulu, 1803\u20131812\nKailua-Kona, 1812\u20131820\nLahaina, 1820\u20131845\nHonolulu, 1845\u20131898Annexed by the United States in 1898, Honolulu remained the capital, first of the Territory of Hawaii (1900\u20131959), and then of the state (since 1959).\n\nTexas\nDuring its history as a sovereign nation (Republic of Texas, 1836\u20131845), seven sites served as the capital of Texas:\n\nWashington (now Washington-on-the-Brazos), 1836\nHarrisburg (now part of Houston), 1836\nGalveston, 1836\nVelasco, 1836\nWest Columbia, 1836\nHouston, 1837\u20131839\nAustin, 1839\u20131845Annexed by the United States in 1845, Austin remains the capital of the state of Texas.\n\nNative American capitals\nSome Native American tribes, in particular the Five Civilized Tribes, organized their states with constitutions and capitals in Western style. Others, like the Iroquois, had long-standing, pre-Columbian traditions of a 'capitol' longhouse where wampum and council fires were maintained with special status. Since they did business with the U.S. Federal Government, these capitals can be seen as officially recognized in some sense.\n\nCherokee Nation\nNew Echota 1825\u20131832New Echota, now near Calhoun, Georgia, was founded in 1825, realizing the dream and plans of Cherokee Chief Major Ridge. Major Ridge chose the site because of its centrality in the historic Cherokee Nation which spanned parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, and because it was near the confluence of the Conasauga and Coosawattee rivers. The town's layout was partly inspired by Ridge's many visits to Washington D.C. and to Baltimore, but also invoked traditional themes of the Southeastern ceremonial complex. Complete with the Council House, Supreme Court, Cherokee syllabary printing press, and the houses of several of the Nation's constitutional officers, New Echota served as the capital until 1832 when the state of Georgia outlawed Native American assembly in an attempt to undermine the Nation. Thousands of Cherokee would gather in New Echota for the annual National Councils, camping along the nearby rivers and holding long stomp dances in the park-like woods that were typical of many Southeastern Native American settlements.\n\nRed Clay 1832\u20131838The Cherokee National council grounds were moved to Red Clay, Tennessee, on the Georgia state line, in order to evade the Georgia state militia. The log cabins, limestone springs, and park-like woods of Red Clay served as the capital until the Cherokee Nation was removed to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) on the Trail of Tears.\nTahlequah 1839\u20131907, 1938\u2013presentTahlequah, in present-day Oklahoma, served as the capital of the original Cherokee Nation after Removal. After the Civil War, a turbulent period for the Nation which was involved in its own civil war resulting from pervasive anger and disagreements over removal from Georgia, the Cherokee Nation built a new National Capitol in Tahlequah out of brick. The building served as the capitol until 1907, when the Dawes Act finally dissolved the Cherokee Nation and Tahlequah became the county seat of Cherokee County, Oklahoma. The Cherokee National government was re-established in 1938 and Tahlequah remains the capital of the modern Cherokee Nation; it is also the capital of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.\n\nCherokee 20th century\u2013present (Eastern Band of Cherokee)Approximately four to eight hundred Cherokees escaped removal because they lived on a separated tract, purchased later with the help of Confederate Colonel William Holland Thomas, along the Oconaluftee River deep in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Some Cherokees fleeing the Federal Army, sent for the \"round up\", fled to the remote settlements separated from the rest of the Cherokee Territory in Georgia and North Carolina, in order to remain in their homeland. In the 20th century, their descendants organized as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; its capital is at Cherokee, North Carolina, in the tribally-controlled Qualla Boundary.\n\nMuscogee Creek Nation\nHot Springs, Arkansas c.\u20091837\u20131866After Removal from their Alabama-Georgia homeland, the Creek national government met near Hot Springs which was then part of their new territory as prescribed in the Treaty of Cusseta. Because some Creeks fought with the Confederacy in the American Civil War, the Union forced the Creeks to cede over 3,000,000-acre (1,200,000 ha) - half of their land in what is now Arkansas.\nOkmulgee 1867\u20131906Served as the National capital after the American Civil War. It was probably named after Ocmulgee, on the Ocmulgee river in Macon, a principle Coosa and later Creek town built with mounds and functioning as part of the Southeastern ceremonial complex. However, there were other traditional Creek \"mother-towns\" before removal. The Ocmulgee mounds were ceded illegally in 1821 with the Treaty of Indian Springs.\n\nIroquois Confederacy\nOnondaga (Onondaga privilege c.\u20091450\u2013present)The Iroquois Confederacy or Haudenosaunee, which means \"People of the Longhouse,\" was an alliance between the Five and later Six-Nations of Iroquoian language and culture of upstate New York. These include the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and, after 1722, the Tuscarora Nations. Since the Confederacy's formation around 1450, the Onondaga Nation has held privilege of hosting the Iroquois Grand Council and the status of Keepers of the Fire and the Wampum \u2014which they still do at the official Longhouse on the Onondaga Reservation. Now spread over reservations in New York and Ontario, the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee preserve this arrangement to this day in what they claim to be the \"world's oldest representative democracy.\"\n\nSeneca Nation of Indians\nJimerson Town (Allegany Reservation)\nIrving (Cattaraugus Reservation)The Seneca Nation republic was founded in 1848 and has two capitals that rotate responsibilities every two years. Jimerson Town was founded in the 1960s following the formation of the Allegheny Reservoir. The Senecas also have an administrative longhouse in Steamburg but do not consider that location to be a capital.\n\nNavajo Nation\nWindow RockWindow Rock (Navajo: Ts\u00e9gh\u00e1hoodz\u00e1n\u00ed), Arizona, is a small city that serves as the seat of government and capital of the Navajo Nation (1936\u2013present), the largest territory of a sovereign Native American nation in North America. It lies within the boundaries of the St. Michaels Chapter, adjacent to the Arizona and New Mexico state line. Window Rock hosts the Navajo Nation governmental campus which contains the Navajo Nation Council, Navajo Nation Supreme Court, the offices of the Navajo Nation President and Vice President, and many Navajo government buildings.\n\nUnrecognized national capitals\nThere have been a handful of self-declared or undeclared nations within the current borders of the United States which were never officially recognized as legally independent sovereign entities; however, these nations did have de facto control over their respective regions during their existence.\n\nColonies of British America\nPrior to the independence of the United States from Great Britain, declared July 4, 1776 in the Declaration of Independence and ultimately secured in the American Revolutionary War, several congresses were convened on behalf of some of the colonies of British America. However, these bodies did not address the question of independence from England, and therefore did not designate a national capital. The Second Continental Congress encompassed the period during which the United States declared independence, but had not yet established a permanent national capital.\n\nVermont Republic\nBefore joining the United States as the fourteenth state, Vermont was an independent republic known as the Vermont Republic (1777\u20131791). Three cities served as the capital of the Republic:\n\nWestminster, 1777\nWindsor, 1777\u2013?\nCastleton, ?\u20131791The current capital of the State of Vermont is Montpelier.\n\nState of Franklin\nThe State of Franklin was an autonomous, secessionist United States territory created not long after the end of the American Revolution from territory that later was ceded by North Carolina to the federal government. Franklin's territory later became part of the state of Tennessee. Franklin was never officially admitted into the Union of the United States and existed for only four years.\n\nJonesborough, Tennessee, 1784\u2013?\nGreeneville, Tennessee, 1785?\u2013?\n\nState of Muskogee\nThe State of Muskogee was a Native American state in Spanish Florida created by the Englishman William Augustus Bowles, who was its \"Director General,\" author of its Constitution, and designer of its flag. It consisted of several tribes of Creeks and Seminoles. It existed from 1799 to 1803. It had one capital:\n\nMiccosukee, 1799\u20131803\n\nRepublic of West Florida\nThe Republic of West Florida was a short-lived nation that broke away from the territory of Spanish West Florida in 1810.  It comprised the Florida Parishes of the modern state of Louisiana and the Mobile District of the modern states of Mississippi and Alabama. (The Republic of West Florida did not include any part of the modern state of Florida.) Ownership of the area had been in dispute between Spain and the United States, which claimed that it had been included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Within two months of the settlers' rebellion and the declaration of an independent nation, President James Madison sent American forces to peaceably occupy the new republic. It was formally annexed by the United States in 1812 over the objections of Spain and the land was divided between the Territory of Orleans and Territory of Mississippi. During its brief existence, the capital of the Republic of West Florida was:\n\nSt. Francisville, Louisiana, 1810\n\nRepublic of Indian Stream\nThe Republic of Indian Stream was an unrecognized independent nation within the present state of New Hampshire.\n\nThe area that would become Pittsburg, New Hampshire, 1832\u20131835\n\nCalifornia Republic\nBefore being annexed by the United States in 1848 (following the Mexican\u2013American War), a small portion of north-central California declared itself the California Republic, in an act of independence from Mexico, in 1846 (see Bear Flag Revolt).  The republic only existed a month before it disbanded itself to join the advancing American army; its claimed territory later became part of the United States as a result of the Mexican Cession.\n\nThe very short-lived California Republic was never recognized by the United States, Mexico or any other nation.  The flag, featuring a silhouette of a California grizzly bear, a star, and the words \"California Republic\", became known as the Bear Flag and was later the basis for the official state flag of California.\nThere was one de facto capital of the California Republic:\n\nSonoma, 1846\n\nConfederate States\nThe Confederate States of America (C.S.A.) had two capitals during its existence. The first capital was established February 4, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama, and remained there until it was moved to Richmond, Virginia, on May 29, 1861, after Virginia seceded on May 23.\nThe individual state capitals remained the same in the Confederacy as they had been in the Union (U.S.A.), although as the advancing Union Army used those cities for military districts, some of the Confederate governments were relocated or moved out of state, traveling along with secessionist armies.\n\nMontgomery, February 4, 1861 \u2013 May 29, 1861\nRichmond, May 29, 1861 \u2013 April 3, 1865\n\nHistorical state, colonial, and territorial capitals\nMost of the original Thirteen Colonies had their capitals occupied or attacked by the British during the American Revolutionary War.  State governments operated where and as they could.  The City of New York was occupied by British troops from 1776 to 1783.  A similar situation occurred during the War of 1812, during the American Civil War in many Confederate states, and during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680\u20131692 in New Mexico.\n\nTwenty-two state capitals have been a capital longer than their state has been a state, since they served as the capital of a predecessor territory, colony, or republic. Boston, Massachusetts, has been a capital city since 1630; it is the oldest continuously-running capital in the United States. Santa Fe, New Mexico, is the oldest capital city, having become capital in 1610 and interrupted only by the aforementioned Pueblo Revolt. An even older Spanish city, St. Augustine, Florida, served as a colonial capital from 1565 until about 1820, more than 250 years.\nThe table below includes the following information:\n\nThe state, the year in which statehood was granted, and the state's capital are shown in bold type.  NOTE: For the first thirteen states, formerly the Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain on the Atlantic seaboard, the year of statehood is shown as 1776 (United States Declaration of Independence) rather than the subsequent year each state ratified the 1787 United States Constitution. (See List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union.)\nThe year listed for each capital is the starting date; the ending date is the starting date for the successor unless otherwise indicated.\nIn many cases, capital cities of historical jurisdictions were outside of a state's present borders.

It broadcasts documentaries, news, special events coverage and discussion programmes. Phoenix's headquarters are in Bonn, the former West German capital.\nOn November 15th 2022, Phoenix closed its SDTV feed across its cable and satellite feeds, but the SD feed can still be received via an antenna.\n\nProgramming\nPhoenix broadcasts a deaf-subtitled version of the Tagesschau, ARD's flagship news broadcast, and ZDF's premier news broadcast Heute-Journal, in German Sign Language.\nThe channel's flagship news broadcast is Der Tag (\"The Day\"), which airs from 11:00 pm to midnight. Its length enables extended reports and interviews to be included.\nThe show Vor Ort (\"On Scene\") includes live coverage of political events, public lectures by important personalities, press conferences and assemblies of the Bundestag and Bundesrat.\nDaily talk shows like Phoenix Runde (Phoenix Roundtable) with Alexander K\u00e4hler, Unter den Linden with Michaela Kolster or Michael Hirz, discuss current topics with experts or politicians.\nAs a benchmark in coverage, a \"Meet the Press\"-like show, Internationaler Fr\u00fchschoppen is broadcast Sunday at 12 noon when the ARD's Presseclub is not broadcast.\nThe series \"Historische Debatten\" (\"Historical Debates\") and \"Historische Ereignisse\" (\"Historical Events\"), with journalist Helmut Illert, examine important topics relating to the development of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nPhoenix is comparable to the American channel C-SPAN or the British BBC Parliament, because they also cover government and national politics.\n\nCreation\nThe creation of Phoenix is credited to the former chancellor Helmut Kohl, who wanted to create a \"European Parliamentary Channel\". However, the idea was rejected due to criticism by the public channels (ARD and ZDF) and suspicion that political pressure from Kohl could lead to a \"Helmut-Kohl-Channel\".\nThe real idea for \"Phoenix - Der Ereignis- und Dokumentationskanal\" (\"Phoenix - the current affairs and documentary channel\") came from viewers of ARD and ZDF, who wanted a \"media-political correction of faults in the system of information transfer\". This created the opportunity to create a \"Parliamentary Channel\", with the aim of increasing credibility and satisfying consumer demand.\nPrivate channels (RTL and Sat. 1) criticized the creation of Phoenix because they were at the time creating their own news channels (n-tv and N24 respectively).\nThe headquarters of Phoenix were provisionally situated in Cologne. However, in 2000, the headquarters were relocated to studios in Bonn.\nPhoenix's highest ratings to date were in August 2006, when it had 1.0% viewer share. With about 4.5 million viewers, it had more viewers than N-TV and N24.\n\nAlignment of programming\nPhoenix's stated aim is it to create \"balance of the shortening of information, which are seen in news and magazines on television\". The programming should be a \"truthful illustration of the reality in correspondence with the constitutional order of the publicly-funded broadcast and television stations in Germany\". The target is fulfilled with current reportages and documentaries from the vast archive of ARD and ZDF, as well as international productions from Discovery Channel and the BBC, dubbed into German.\n\nLogo history\nAudience share\nGermany\nPassage 6:\nChol Kiri District\nChol Kiri (Khmer: \u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u1780\u1787\u179b\u1782\u17b7\u179a\u17b8) is a district (srok) in the east of Kampong Chhnang province, in central  Cambodia. The district capital is Chol Kiri town located around eight km (5.0 mi) south of the provincial capital of Kampong Chhnang by road. Chol Kiri district is the easternmost district of Kampong Chhnang. The district shares a border with Kampong Thom and Kampong Cham provinces to the east. Most of the district is low lying floodplain and the Tonl\u00e9 Sap river runs through the district roughly from north to south. This proximity to the river and the lack of high land make Chol Kiri one of the most flood prone districts in the country. The Kampong Chhnang Department of Development has estimated that both Chol Kiri and Kampong Leaeng districts are flooded for six months of the year and that after the floodwaters have receded drinking water sources are left contaminated.The district has virtually no significant road infrastructure and all settlements are located along the Tonle Sap river and various smaller tributaries. Chol Kiri district is one of the smallest districts in Kampong Chhnang province by land area and only Kampong Chhnang district is smaller. It also has the smallest district population in the province due to its small size, flooded landscape and lack of road transport infrastructure. Two small tertiary roads run to Chol Kiri town from National Highway 6 in Batheay district in Kampong Cham province.\n\nLocation\nChol Kiri district lies in the east of the province and shares a border with Kampong Thom and Kampong Cham provinces. Reading from the north clockwise, Chol Kiri borders with Kampong Leang district to the north and north west and Baray district of Kampong Thom to the north east. The eastern border of the district is shared with Batheay district of Kampong Cham province. To the south the district shares a border with Kampong Tralach district. The western border of the district joins with Rola B'ier district and Kampong Chhnang district which surrounds the provincial capital.\n\nAdministration\nThe district is subdivided into five communes (khum) and 26 villages (phum). The Chol Kiri district governor reports to Touch Marim, the Governor of Kampong Chhnang. The following table shows the villages of Chol Kiri district by commune.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 1998 Census, the population of the district was 28,300 persons in 4,918 households in 1998. This population consisted of 13,883 males (49.1%) and 14,417 females (50.9%). With a population of under 30,000 people, Chol Kiri has by far the smallest district populations in Kampong Chhnang province. The average household size in Chol Kiri is 5.8 persons per household, which is significantly larger than the rural average for Cambodia (5.2 persons). The sex ratio in the district is 96.3%, with slightly more females than males.\n\nMurder over burials\nOn July 6, 2008, a farmer named Lon Chak died from axe wounds to the head in Prey Kiri village, Chol Kiri district. His uncle An Lonh confessed responsibility for the crime to local police. Lonh reported that the crime stemmed from a long-standing dispute with his nephew. The dispute between the two relatives was over burying bodies on farmland belong to Lonh. Lonh reported to police that Chak had already buried two of his relatives on the land against Lonh's wishes. After Chak buried a third body, Lonh attacked his nephew with an axe.\nPassage 7:\nCapital Bars\nCapital Bars plc (formerly known as Break for the Border Group plc) was an Irish leisure company based in Dublin. Its core business was the acquisition, development and operation of bars, hotels and restaurants, all based in Dublin city centre. Brothers Desmond and Liam O'Dwyer control the company as Joint Managing Directors. After acquiring Capital Bars in 2001, the O\u2019Dwyers took the company private the following year.The company was dissolved in 2017 following the sale of all its operational assets.The business originally began in O'Dwyers Bar and Lounge, in Mount Street Dublin 2. This small family run pub was extensively refurbished by elder brother Liam O'Dwyer in the early 1980s and became the first \"victorian style\" pub of which Dublin is so well known for now. This was also one of the first pubs in Dublin to sell \"pub-grub\" at lunch times.\nThe chain reached its peak in number of pubs in the early 2000s, with 11 pubs\/nightclubs, one Planet Hollywood franchise and 3 hotels in 2001; but significant numbers of pubs were divested prior to 2009 including Bad Bobs for \u20ac12m in 2006. Poor financial performance was reported during the mid-00s.The company entered mixed examinership\/receivership on September 19, 2009; five days after poor results showing a 10m euro loss in the previous year.  At that time the portfolio of multi-themed bars (several of them 'superpubs') included: Break for the Border, Caf\u00e9 En Seine, Howl at the Moon, The Dragon, and The George, Dublin. All were situated in key locations in Dublin City Centre.\nThe O'Dwyers repurchased ownership of much of the section of the group put through receivership through their company Toji Holdings, with the other premises exiting examinership; however all properties have since been sold.\nThe \"Zanzibar\" pub was closed, and has since been sold for redevelopment as a hotel.The Trinity Capital Hotel was sold in 2013 with the Grafton Capital Hotel sold in 2015, closing for refurbishment afterwards.The remaining pubs - Caf\u00e9 En Seine, The Dragon, The George and Howl at the Moon - were sold for a reported \u20ac15 million in late 2014 to rival pub and hotel operator Mercantile Group.\nPassage 8:\nBondary\nBondary [b\u0254n\u02c8dar\u0268] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Micha\u0142owo, within Bia\u0142ystok County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland, close to the border with Belarus. It lies approximately 14 kilometres (9 mi) south-east of Micha\u0142owo and 44 km (27 mi) south-east of the regional capital Bia\u0142ystok.\nThe village has a population of 330.\nPassage 9:\nKQSC\nKQSC (1530 AM) is a radio station licensed to broadcast from Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States, with a daytime power of 15,000 watts, and can be heard by day from the outskirts of Denver to the state's border with New Mexico.In August 2006, Don Crawford Jr. bought the then-KCMN and a sister station, KCBR, from his father's radio company, Crawford Broadcasting, for an undisclosed amount (formally, KCMN was purchased by a new company called DJR Broadcasting, owned by Crawford). The new owner said that the formats and staffing would stay the same at the stations. Crawford had begun working at Crawford Broadcasting in 1989, and had been a regional manager since 1994, responsible for the company's stations in Colorado Springs, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Following the purchase, Crawford was to continue to manage KAAM in Dallas, which continues to run a \"Legends\" adult standards format similar to KCMN's former format.Beginning in 2007, the station began broadcasting in HD Radio format.In 2012, DJR Broadcasting sold KCMN (along with sister station KCBR) to the locally owned Pueblo Radio Group. PRG flipped KCMN from \"Legends 1530\" to an oldies format, even though KCMN added Classic Top 40\/Oldies titles from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s under the ownerships of Crawford Sr. and Jr.\nOn February 5, 2015, KCMN changed their call letters to KKHI.\nOn March 18, 2015, Kona Coast Radio closed on their acquisition of KKHI at a price of $200,000. Following the acquisition, KKHI went silent. On October 16, 2015, the station changed their call sign to KQSC.\nEffective December 10, 2015, KQSC was sold by Kona Coast Radio to Mountain Radio Group Inc., at a purchase price of $200,000. On January 1, 2016, KQSC flipped to a country music format called Mountain Country 1530.\nPassage 10:\nWFFG-FM\nWFFG-FM (100.3 FM), known as \"Froggy 100.3\", is a country music radio station licensed to Warrensburg, New York, and is owned by Pamal Broadcasting.  The radio studios and offices are on Everts Avenue in Queensbury, New York.WFFG-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 1,450 watts.  Its transmitter is near Black Spruce Mountain in the town of Warrensburg, Warren County, New York, near the Adirondack Northway.  The tower is shared with WCKM-FM and WCQL.  Thanks to its tall tower, WFFG-FM's signal can be heard as far south as southern Albany and Rensselaer counties, and as far north as Schroon Lake and Elizabethtown.\n\nHistory\nWFFG-FM signed on November 1, 1990, on 100.5 MHz with 6 kilowatts ERP as adult contemporary KB-100 with the WKBE call letters. Locally owned by Karamatt Broadcasting, LLC, KB-100 aired mostly local programming with some off-peak timeslots carrying syndicated programs and also aired local programs such as high school sporting events. These events, however, were soon taken by WCKM-FM when that station signed on.\nIn 1994, Karamatt filed an application to upgrade for a 6 kilowatt Class A station to a 25 kilowatt Class B1 station as a response to the then-new application of the similarly powered WNYQ with the station moving down to 100.3 MHz in the process. The move took place in summer 1995; however, the increased value of the station led to its sale to Paul Bendat, owner of WABY\/WABY-FM\/WKLI in Albany in March 1996 after two months of running WKLI's K-Lite format under an LMA. With WKLI's adult contemporary format on the decline, Bendat saw an opportunity, and both WKLI and WKBE flipped to CHR K-100 with the closing of the purchase of WKBE.\nThough the initial year of WKBE's new format did well in the ratings, outlasting upstart WHTR, the station soon began to enter a period of decline, and in February 1999, Bendat sold his stations to Tele-Media, Inc. After a three-month stunting period, the stations relaunched as modern adult contemporary The Point that May (with WKLI taking the WCPT calls in the process). After two years of struggling against a relaunched WNYQ in Glens Falls as well as WFLY and WRVE in Albany, Tele-Media sold WCPT and WKBE in August 2001 to Pamal Broadcasting with the sale closing that October.\n\nWhile WCPT (which reverted to WKLI) took a new format, WKBE instead retained the Point format, though now programming was based out of Glens Falls. This format has evolved over the last decade from the modern adult contemporary approach in place at the outset to a variation more similar to CHR and eventually to a modern rock-leaning format.\nFrom November 22, 2006, to December 25, 2006, the station stunted with a temporary Christmas music format, and after the month-long stint of Christmas music, WKBE began its lean towards a modern rock-oriented format on December 26, by introducing a new logo and slogan (Today's Modern Mix).\n\nAfter the relaunch in 2006, the station's playlist included mainly modern and active rock artists, such as Alanis Morissette, Evanescence, No Doubt, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Green Day, as well as pop rock acts such as Kelly Clarkson, Christina Perri, Paramore, Neon Trees, and Avril Lavigne. In the late 2000s, soul music artists such as Adele, Duffy, and KT Tunstall began to be added to the playlist; however, by 2010, the station has become closer to a true modern rock format, although the station still plays some modern AC and AAA artists which are not found on most modern rock stations. By 2012, Arbitron, Mediabase and Nielsen BDS reported the station under the hot adult contemporary format.\nOn December 27, 2013, WKBE and sister station WFFG-FM swapped formats and call letters; WKBE became a country music format as Froggy 100.3 and WFFG-FM became a modern AC\/AAA format as 107.1 The Point.\nPassage 11:\nPotes\nPotes is a municipality in the autonomous community of Cantabria in Spain. It is the capital of the Comarca of Li\u00e9bana and is located in the centre of it. It is bordered to the north by Cillorigo de Li\u00e9bana, to the west by Camale\u00f1o, to the south by Vega de Li\u00e9bana and to the east by Cabez\u00f3n de Li\u00e9bana.\n\nGeography\nThe town of Potes is located at the confluence of four valleys, near where the River Quiviesa flows in the River Deva, the latter born at altitudes of the Picos de Europa. Like the rest of the Li\u00e9bana region, Potes enjoys a Mediterranean microclimate that allows the cultivation of the vines, walnut and poplar. Overlooking the town is Arabedes mountain (694m).\n\nHistory\nPotes is located at a strategic point where the two rivers of Li\u00e9bana meet: the Deva and its tributary the Quiviesa. There is little trace of prehistoric occupation in the region, but the Romans named it Pontes. A village was founded in the 8th century under Alfonso I of Asturias. Potes appeared for the first time in a document written in 847; the document mentions the parish church and the town. Later in the 10th century, Potes became the administrative centre of the Comarca of Li\u00e9bana. Potes was considered a city from the 13th century and received royal recognition.\nIn the Becerro de las Behetr\u00edas de Castilla manuscript (1351), Potes appears as the property of Tello Alfonso, son of Alfonso XI of Castile. During the late Middle Ages, like all of Li\u00e9bana, the town was involved in the confrontation between the families of Manrique Casta\u00f1eda and Mendoza. In 1444, John II of Castile resolved the issue in favour of the Marquis of Santillana. The Marquis made Potes the capital of Liebana, and erected a large tower, called the Torre del Infantado. In this same period, other prominent buildings, such as the nearby Tower of Orej\u00f3n de la Lama and the San Cayetano bridge were built.\nIn the modern age, Potes remained a place of manorialism. The Duke of Infantado appointed its mayor. Many villagers emigrated to America and the riches of the new continent allowed the construction of notable buildings in the village. In 1822, Potes received its own town council, being head of a judicial district covering Potes, Castro and Cillorigo, Cabez\u00f3n de Li\u00e9bana, Camale\u00f1o, Espinama, Pesaguero, Tresviso and Vega de Li\u00e9bana. Thirty years later, it was incorporated into the judicial district of San Vicente de la Barquera.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Potes was hit by a fire caused by the Republican side that destroyed the old town, it was rebuilt afterwards. The old town was classified as a Conjunto Hist\u00f3rico in 1983.\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nThe main source of income is from tourism due to its location in the Picos de Europa. Potes is on the national road N-621. The nearest major town, Santander, is 100 km away.\n\nSites and monuments\nThe old town, a historical monument, is a maze of alleys and steps with a medieval atmosphere.\nIt is dominated by the Torre del Infantado, a symbol of Potes, built in the 15th century. It has four floors and forms an imposing stone cube, only relieved by turrets. The tower now houses the City Council.\nThe old gothic church of San Vicente was built in 15th century and rebuilt from the late 15th century to 17th century, it was replaced in the 19th  century by the new parish church of San Vicente. This has 18th-century altarpieces from the Convent of San Raimundo and a sculpture of Saint Vincent, patron saint of the city. In the square is a monument to the violinist Jes\u00fas de Monasterio who was a native of Potes.\nThe nearby Bridge of San Cayetano overlooks the Rio Quiviesa since the 13th century. At one end is the Ermita de San Cayetano, a chapel which retains its wooden doors and an altarpiece of the 18th century with a portrait of San Cayetano and the Torre de Orej\u00f3n de la Lama, built from the 15th century to the 17th century and has on its front the shields of Celis and Bedoya. It now serves as a centre for exhibitions and cultural events.\nOther houses, the Casona de la Canal (18th century), the Torre de la Familia Osorio (17th century) and the 18th century San Marcial Street, bears the arms of the family Campillo and birthplace of Jesus Monasterio, dating from the same period.\nThe Ermita de la Virgen del Camino is a chapel of the 18th century in the district of la Serna, it has an altarpiece of the same century. The Convent of San Raimundo was built in the early 17th century by the Benedictines. It remains today as the cloister which houses an exhibition on the Picos de Europa and Comarca of Li\u00e9bana.\nThe Ermita de la Virgen de Valmayor, located outside the village, on the road to Vega de Liebana is a chapel built in the 16th century. The altarpiece of the 18th century with the image of the Virgin of Valmayor. This image is carried every 15 August during a procession.\n\nDemographics\nAdministration\nFrancisco Javier Gomez Ruiz (PP) is the current mayor of the municipality. The following tables show the results of the elections held in 2003 and 2007.\n\nCuisine\nThe best known dish from Potes is the chickpea stew Cocido Lebaniego. Other products from Potes, include various cheeses, honey and the grape brandy Orujo that is made from wine grown in the valley.\n\nFestivals and events\nPotes has regular religious processions:\n\n23 January, the day of the martyr Saint Vincent, patron saint of Potes, and it is the occasion of traditional dances and festivities.\nEarly May, the Li\u00e9bana is host to the procession of Santuca, one of the biggest in Spain. The statue of the Virgen de la Luz leaves the chapel to join Aniezo Santo Toribio de Liebana.\n15 August, the procession of the Virgen de Valmayor is accompanied by dance, music and songs of the Middle Ages.\nFrom 13 to 17 September, there is the festival of the Exaltation of the Cross (the Monastery Santo Toribio claims to retain a fragment of the True Cross). This holiday is declared to be of Regional Tourist Interest.Non-religious, the Feast of the Orujo is also a major event, which takes place in November.\nPassage 12:\nCarre\u00f1o\nCarre\u00f1o is a municipality in the autonomous community of the Principality of Asturias, Spain. It is bordered by Corvera de Asturias on the west, Goz\u00f3n on the north, the Cantabrian Sea on the north and east, and Gij\u00f3n on the east and south. Its capital is Cand\u00e1s.\n\nHistory\nAs characteristic of other sites in Asturias, artifacts from the Neolithic era were also found in Carre\u00f1o.

It broadcasts an adult contemporary format. The studios and offices are on Rookwood Avenue in Fredericton, shared with sister stations CFXY-FM and CKHJ.CIBX-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 78,000 watts, horizontal polarization only.  The transmitter is on Provincial Route 620 at Route 617, at Hamtown Corner in Douglas, northwest of Fredericton.\n\nHistory\nCIBX traces its history to the first radio station in New Brunswick, CFNB.  The call letters stood for Fredericton, New Brunswick. The station went on the air under the experimental call sign of 10AD, broadcasting at 1210 kilocycles in 1923.  It was granted a full license as CFNB in 1926. CFNB then moved to 1030 in 1933, and to 550 in 1934.\nThe station was affiliated with the CBC's Trans-Canada Network. In 1959 the station increased its power to 50,000 watts, giving it full-time coverage over most of the Maritime Provinces. The CBC affiliation was dropped in 1964 when the network started its own station in Fredericton, CBZ. CFNB played a full service, adult contemporary format before switching to oldies in the early 1990s.\nIn 1996, CFNB's parent company, Radio Atlantic, was granted permission to move its signal to 106.9 FM and to shut down the AM transmitter. The call sign changed in the process, and after a brief simulcast period, CFNB 550 signed off the air on June 11 of that year. The new station, CIBX, played soft adult contemporary music. The former CFNB call sign now belongs to a radio station in D'Arcy, British Columbia, known as CFNB-FM. Over time, CIBX evolved towards adult contemporary.\nBetween 2000 and 2005, CIBX used the on-air \"EZ Rock\" branding along with other stations in Canada, while using Capital FM as a secondary name.  Eventually, \"EZ Rock\" was phased out as a moniker.\nAs of July 18, 2012, CIBX officially flipped to Top 40\/CHR. It was one of two Top 40 outlets in the Fredericton radio market as it took on rival station CFRK-FM. The competition lasted nearly three years.   On May 31, 2015, CFRK flipped to country music, which left CIBX as the only Top 40 station in the market.CIBX and seven other radio stations in the Atlantic Provinces are currently owned by Bell Media.\nOn December 27, 2020, as part of a mass format reorganization by Bell Media, CIBX shifted to Hot AC and rebranded as Move 106.9.

{"context":"Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ng\u0169g\u0129 wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University.\n\nThe book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement.\n\nPlot summary\n\nNjoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty.\n\nOne day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed. Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge\u2019s family is forced to move. Njoroge\u2019s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father.\n\nMwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school.\n\nFor a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta \u2013 a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya\u2019s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population.\n\nJacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods.\n\nOne day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition.\n\nSeveral months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau. Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God.\n\nNjoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father\u2019s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice.\n\nCharacters in Weep Not, Child\n Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible.\n Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression.\n Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi.\n Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II).\n Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting). It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo.\n Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother.\n Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village.\n Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school.\n\nThemes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt.\n\nThe novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government.","label":"longbench","length":1935,"title":"Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o.

{"context":"Introduction\nDeep learning systems have shown a lot of promise for extractive Question Answering (QA), with performance comparable to humans when large scale data is available. However, practitioners looking to build QA systems for specific applications may not have the resources to collect tens of thousands of questions on corpora of their choice. At the same time, state-of-the-art machine reading systems do not lend well to low-resource QA settings where the number of labeled question-answer pairs are limited (c.f. Table 2 ). Semi-supervised QA methods like BIBREF0 aim to improve this performance by leveraging unlabeled data which is easier to collect.\nIn this work, we present a semi-supervised QA system which requires the end user to specify a set of base documents and only a small set of question-answer pairs over a subset of these documents. Our proposed system consists of three stages. First, we construct cloze-style questions (predicting missing spans of text) from the unlabeled corpus; next, we use the generated clozes to pre-train a powerful neural network model for extractive QA BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 ; and finally, we fine-tune the model on the small set of provided QA pairs.\nOur cloze construction process builds on a typical writing phenomenon and document structure: an introduction precedes and summarizes the main body of the article. Many large corpora follow such a structure, including Wikipedia, academic papers, and news articles. We hypothesize that we can benefit from the un-annotated corpora to better answer various questions \u2013 at least ones that are lexically similar to the content in base documents and directly require factual information.\nWe apply the proposed system on three datasets from different domains \u2013 SQuAD BIBREF3 , TriviaQA-Web BIBREF4 and the BioASQ challenge BIBREF5 . We observe significant improvements in a low-resource setting across all three datasets. For SQuAD and TriviaQA, we attain an F1 score of more than 50% by merely using 1% of the training data. Our system outperforms the approaches for semi-supervised QA presented in BIBREF0 , and a baseline which uses the same unlabeled data but with a language modeling objective for pretraining. In the BioASQ challenge, we outperform the best performing system from previous year's challenge, improving over a baseline which does transfer learning from the SQuAD dataset. Our analysis reveals that questions which ask for factual information and match to specific parts of the context documents benefit the most from pretraining on automatically constructed clozes.\nRelated Work\nSemi-supervised learning augments the labeled dataset $L$ with a potentially larger unlabeled dataset $U$ . BIBREF0 presented a model, GDAN, which trained an auxiliary neural network to generate questions from passages by reinforcement learning, and augment the labeled dataset with the generated questions to train the QA model. Here we use a much simpler heuristic to generate the auxiliary questions, which also turns out to be more effective as we show superior performance compared to GDAN. Several approaches have been suggested for generating natural questions BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , however none of them show a significant improvement of using the generated questions in a semi-supervised setting. Recent papers also use unlabeled data for QA by training large language models and extracting contextual word vectors from them to input to the QA model BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . The applicability of this method in the low-resource setting is unclear as the extra inputs increase the number of parameters in the QA model, however, our pretraining can be easily applied to these models as well.\nDomain adaptation (and Transfer learning) leverage existing large scale datasets from a source domain (or task) to improve performance on a target domain (or task). For deep learning and QA, a common approach is to pretrain on the source dataset and then fine-tune on the target dataset BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . BIBREF14 used SQuAD as a source for the target BioASQ dataset, and BIBREF15 used Book Test BIBREF16 as source for the target SQuAD dataset. BIBREF17 transfer learned model layers from the tasks of sequence labeling, text classification and relation classification to show small improvements on SQuAD. All these works use manually curated source datatset, which in themselves are expensive to collect. Instead, we show that it is possible to automatically construct the source dataset from the same domain as the target, which turns out to be more beneficial in terms of performance as well (c.f. Section \"Experiments & Results\" ). Several cloze datasets have been proposed in the literature which use heuristics for construction BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 . We further see the usability of such a dataset in a semi-supervised setting.\nMethodology\nOur system comprises of following three steps:\nCloze generation: Most of the documents typically follow a template, they begin with an introduction that provides an overview and a brief summary for what is to follow. We assume such a structure while constructing our cloze style questions. When there is no clear demarcation, we treat the first $K\\%$ (hyperparameter, in our case 20%) of the document as the introduction. While noisy, this heuristic generates a large number of clozes given any corpus, which we found to be beneficial for semi-supervised learning despite the noise.\nWe use a standard NLP pipeline based on Stanford CoreNLP (for SQuAD, TrivaQA and PubMed) and the BANNER Named Entity Recognizer (only for PubMed articles) to identify entities and phrases. Assume that a document comprises of introduction sentences $\\lbrace q_1, q_2, ... q_n\\rbrace $ , and the remaining passages $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $ . Additionally, let's say that each sentence $q_i$ in introduction is composed of words $\\lbrace w_1, w_2, ... w_{l_{q_i}}\\rbrace $ , where $l_{q_i}$ is the length of $q_i$ . We consider a $\\text{match} (q_i, p_j)$ , if there is an exact string match of a sequence of words $\\lbrace w_k, w_{k+1}, .. w_{l_{q_i}}\\rbrace $ between the sentence $q_i$ and passage $p_j$ . If this sequence is either a noun phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase or a named entity in $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $0 , as recognized by CoreNLP or BANNER, we select it as an answer span $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $1 . Additionally, we use $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $2 as the passage $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $3 and form a cloze question $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $4 from the answer bearing sentence $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $5 by replacing $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $6 with a placeholder. As a result, we obtain passage-question-answer ( $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $7 ) triples (Table 1 shows an example). As a post-processing step, we prune out $\\lbrace p_1, p_2, .. p_m\\rbrace $8 triples where the word overlap between the question (Q) and passage (P) is less than 2 words (after excluding the stop words).\nThe process relies on the fact that answer candidates from the introduction are likely to be discussed in detail in the remainder of the article. In effect, the cloze question from the introduction and the matching paragraph in the body forms a question and context passage pair. We create two cloze datasets, one each from Wikipedia corpus (for SQuAD and TriviaQA) and PUBMed academic papers (for the BioASQ challenge), consisting of 2.2M and 1M clozes respectively. From analyzing the cloze data manually, we were able to answer 76% times for the Wikipedia set and 80% times for the PUBMed set using the information in the passage. In most cases the cloze paraphrased the information in the passage, which we hypothesized to be a useful signal for the downstream QA task.\nWe also investigate the utility of forming subsets of the large cloze corpus, where we select the top passage-question-answer triples, based on the different criteria, like i) jaccard similarity of answer bearing sentence in introduction and the passage ii) the tf-idf scores of answer candidates and iii) the length of answer candidates. However, we empirically find that we were better off using the entire set rather than these subsets.\nPre-training: We make use of the generated cloze dataset to pre-train an expressive neural network designed for the task of reading comprehension. We work with two publicly available neural network models \u2013 the GA Reader BIBREF2 (to enable comparison with prior work) and BiDAF + Self-Attention (SA) model from BIBREF1 (which is among the best performing models on SQuAD and TriviaQA). After pretraining, the performance of BiDAF+SA on a dev set of the (Wikipedia) cloze questions is 0.58 F1 score and 0.55 Exact Match (EM) score. This implies that the cloze corpus is neither too easy, nor too difficult to answer.\nFine Tuning: We fine tune the pre-trained model, from the previous step, over a small set of labelled question-answer pairs. As we shall later see, this step is crucial, and it only requires a handful of labelled questions to achieve a significant proportion of the performance typically attained by training on tens of thousands of questions.\nDatasets\nWe apply our system to three datasets from different domains. SQuAD BIBREF3 consists of questions whose answers are free form spans of text from passages in Wikipedia articles. We follow the same setting as in BIBREF0 , and split $10\\%$ of training questions as the test set, and report performance when training on subsets of the remaining data ranging from $1\\%$ to $90\\%$ of the full set. We also report the performance on the dev set when trained on the full training set ( $1^\\ast $ in Table 2 ). We use the same hyperparameter settings as in prior work. We compare and study four different settings: 1) the Supervised Learning (SL) setting, which is only trained on the supervised data, 2) the best performing GDAN model from BIBREF0 , 3) pretraining on a Language Modeling (LM) objective and fine-tuning on the supervised data, and 4) pretraining on the Cloze dataset and fine-tuning on the supervised data. The LM and Cloze methods use exactly the same data for pretraining, but differ in the loss functions used. We report F1 and EM scores on our test set using the official evaluation scripts provided by the authors of the dataset.\nTriviaQA BIBREF4 comprises of over 95K web question-answer-evidence triples. Like SQuAD, the answers are spans of text. Similar to the setting in SQuAD, we create multiple smaller subsets of the entire set. For our semi-supervised QA system, we use the BiDAF+SA model BIBREF1 \u2013 the highest performing publicly available system for TrivaQA. Here again, we compare the supervised learning (SL) settings against the pretraining on Cloze set and fine tuning on the supervised set. We report F1 and EM scores on the dev set.\nWe also test on the BioASQ 5b dataset, which consists of question-answer pairs from PubMed abstracts. We use the publicly available system from BIBREF14 , and follow the exact same setup as theirs, focusing only on factoid and list questions. For this setting, there are only 899 questions for training. Since this is already a low-resource problem we only report results using 5-fold cross-validation on all the available data. We report Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) on the factoid questions, and F1 score for the list questions.\nMain Results\nTable 2 shows a comparison of the discussed settings on both SQuAD and TriviaQA. Without any fine-tuning (column 0) the performance is low, probably because the model never saw a real question, but we see significant gains with Cloze pretraining even with very little labeled data. The BiDAF+SA model, exceeds an F1 score of $50\\%$ with only $1\\%$ of the training data (454 questions for SQuAD, and 746 questions for TriviaQA), and approaches $90\\%$ of the best performance with only $10\\%$ labeled data. The gains over the SL setting, however, diminish as the size of the labeled set increases and are small when the full dataset is available.\nCloze pretraining outperforms the GDAN baseline from BIBREF0 using the same SQuAD dataset splits. Additionally, we show improvements in the $90\\%$ data case unlike GDAN. Our approach is also applicable in the extremely low-resource setting of $1\\%$ data, which we suspect GDAN might have trouble with since it uses the labeled data to do reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we are able to use the same cloze dataset to improve performance on both SQuAD and TriviaQA datasets. When we use the same unlabeled data to pre-train with a language modeling objective, the performance is worse, showing the bias we introduce by constructing clozes is important.\nOn the BioASQ dataset (Table 3 ) we again see a significant improvement when pretraining with the cloze questions over the supervised baseline. The improvement is smaller than what we observe with SQuAD and TriviaQA datasets \u2013 we believe this is because questions are generally more difficult in BioASQ. BIBREF14 showed that pretraining on SQuAD dataset improves the downstream performance on BioASQ. Here, we show a much larger improvement by pretraining on cloze questions constructed in an unsupervised manner from the same domain.\nAnalysis\nRegression Analysis: To understand which types of questions benefit from pre-training, we pre-specified certain features (see Figure 1 right) for each of the dev set questions in SQuAD, and then performed linear regression to predict the F1 score for that question from these features. We predict the F1 scores from the cloze pretrained model ( $y^{\\text{cloze}}$ ), the supervised model ( $y^{\\text{sl}}$ ), and the difference of the two ( $y^{\\text{cloze}}-y^{\\text{sl}}$ ), when using $10\\%$ of labeled data. The coefficients of the fitted model are shown in Figure 1 (left) along with their std errors. Positive coefficients indicate that a high value of that feature is predictive of a high F1 score, and a negative coefficient indicates that a small value of that feature is predictive of a high F1 score (or a high difference of F1 scores from the two models in the case of $y^{\\text{cloze}}-y^{\\text{sl}}$ ).\nThe two strongest effects we observe are that a high lexical overlap between the question and the sentence containing the answer is indicative of high boost with pretraining, and that a high lexical overlap between the question and the whole passage is indicative of the opposite. This is hardly surprising, since our cloze construction process is biased towards questions which have a similar phrasing to the answer sentences in context. Hence, test questions with a similar property are answered correctly after pretraining, whereas those with a high overlap with the whole passage tend to have lower performance. The pretraining also favors questions with short answers because the cloze construction process produces short answer spans. Also passages and questions which consist of tokens infrequent in the SQuAD training corpus receive a large boost after pretraining, since the unlabeled data covers a larger domain.\nPerformance on question types: Figure 2 shows the average gain in F1 score for different types of questions, when we pretrain on the clozes compared to the supervised case. This analysis is done on the $10\\%$ split of the SQuAD training set. We consider two classifications of each question \u2013 one determined on the first word (usually a wh-word) of the question (Figure 2 (bottom)) and one based on the output of a separate question type classifier adapted from BIBREF21 . We use the coarse grain labels namely Abbreviation (ABBR), Entity (ENTY), Description (DESC), Human (HUM), Location (LOC), Numeric (NUM) trained on a Logistic Regression classification system . While there is an improvement across the board, we find that abbreviation questions in particular receive a large boost. Also, \"why\" questions show the least improvement, which is in line with our expectation, since these usually require reasoning or world knowledge which cloze questions rarely require.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we show that pre-training QA models with automatically constructed cloze questions improves the performance of the models significantly, especially when there are few labeled examples. The performance of the model trained only on the cloze questions is poor, validating the need for fine-tuning. Through regression analysis, we find that pretraining helps with questions which ask for factual information located in a specific part of the context. For future work, we plan to explore the active learning setup for this task \u2013 specifically, which passages and \/ or types of questions can we select to annotate, such that there is a maximum performance gain from fine-tuning. We also want to explore how to adapt cloze style pre-training to NLP tasks other than QA.\nAcknowledgments\nBhuwan Dhingra is supported by NSF under grants CCF-1414030 and IIS-1250956 and by grants from Google.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nUlises Sol\u00eds\nJos\u00e9 Ulises Sol\u00eds P\u00e9rez (born 28 August 1981) is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 2000 to 2013. He held the IBF junior flyweight title twice in his career from 2006 to 2009 and from 2011 to 2012. He is the brother of former boxer Jorge Sol\u00eds.\n\nProfessional career\nIn April 2000, Solis won his professional debut against Adolfo Rosillo. He compiled a record of 18-0-1, which included a win over future champion Edgar Sosa.\n\nWBO Light Flyweight Championship\nOn July 30, 2004, Solis challenged WBO Light Flyweight champion Nelson Dieppa but lost the twelve round bout.\n\nIBF Light Flyweight Championship\nOn January 7, 2006, Sol\u00eds defeated Will Grigsby for the IBF world championship title, by a unanimous decision (118-110, 117-111, 116-112). He defended his title against former champion Eric Ortiz and Omar Salado.\nOn January 25, 2008, Solis faced Grigsby in a rematch and defeated him once again by stopping him in the 8th round. On May 19, 2007, Solis defeated former WBC world champion Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguirre via an 8th round technical knock out. On August 4, 2007, he defeated Filipino future champion Rodel Mayol (23-1-0) by technical knockout. On December 15, 2007, Solis defended his title against Filipino veteran boxer Bert Batawang.\nSol\u00eds was scheduled to face Glenn Donaire on May 17, 2008,  however, he was forced to back out after he came down with a serious case of pneumonia. The fight was rescheduled for July 12 at the Palenque De La Expo in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. at Hermosillo, Monterrey, Mexico, 12 rounds. Solis retained the title by scoring a shutout on all 3 judges cards (by the scores of 120-108 twice and 120-117).On December 2, 2008, Solis defeated Nicaraguan Nerys Espinoza by unanimous decision. In total, he defended his IBF title eight times.\nSolis lost the IBF light-flyweight title after he was knocked out in the 11th round of his title bout vs Brian Viloria. On March 27, 2010, Solis defeated Bert Batawang for a second time in an IBF light flyweight title eliminator bout after Batawang retired in the 6th round. Following that victory, Solis defeated former champion Eric Ortiz by a 10-round unanimous decision at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, NV commemorating the 100th anniversary of The Johnson-Jeffries Fight. During this time, Viloria lost the IBF title by knock out to Carlos Tamara, who in turn, lost the title by split decision to Luis Alberto Lazarte.\n\nRegaining the IBF Light Flyweight Championship\nOn December 18, 2010, Solis fought IBF light flyweight champion Luis Alberto Lazarte to a controversial majority draw in Argentina. Solis outboxed Lazarte for the first half of the bout while a frustrated Lazarte repeatedly fouled Solis with illegal punches to the back of the head and below the belt, at one point, even going so far as to bite the challenger. The referee, Max Parker, who had trouble communicating with the fighters in Spanish, warned Lazarte throughout the bout, however, he ultimately only deducted two points from the defending champion. The final scores were 117-109 in favor of Solis while the other two judges controversially scored it 113-113 even. Solis' promoter, Fernando Beltran, is expected to file a formal protest to the IBF on his behalf.On April 30, 2011, Solis faced Lazarte in a rematch of their controversial bout. Solis defeated Lazarte by a 12-round split decision in Argentina to claim the IBF light flyweight title.\n\nAltercation with Canelo \u00c1lvarez and layoff\nIn October 2011, he got into a street fight against fellow Mexican boxer and four-division champion Canelo \u00c1lvarez resulting in a broken jaw. He planned to press charges against \u00c1lvarez but ultimately settled an agreement four years after the incident. Sol\u00eds was forced to vacate his IBF light flyweight title and had a long lay off from the sport after that.\n\nProfessional boxing record\nSee also\nNotable boxing families\nList of IBF world champions\nList of Mexican boxing world champions\nPassage 2:\nWilkins Runway\nWilkins Runway is a single runway aerodrome operated by Australia, located on upper glacier of the ice sheet Preston Heath, Budd Coast, Wilkes Land, on the continent of Antarctica, but 40 km (25 mi) southeast of the actual coast. It is named after Sir Hubert Wilkins, a pioneer of Antarctic aviation and exploration.\n\nHistory\nConstruction of a runway in the Australian Antarctic Territory was first suggested in the 1950s, but logistical, political and environmental issues delayed construction of the runway until 2004. The A$46 million dollar runway is carved into glacial ice, approximately 65 km (40 mi) from the Australian base at Casey Station.\nIn order to be approved by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), Wilkins must be levelled to runway standard with the use of lasers and requires a crew of eight to maintain the level and friction of the runway before each landing.\n\nActivities\nCASA issued an aviation licence for the airline Skytraders to operate passenger flights, and the first flight was made on 11 January 2008, carrying Australia's Environment Minister Peter Garrett, twelve scientists and six other passengers.Flights to Antarctica leave from Hobart International Airport in Tasmania using an Airbus A319, and the flight takes around four hours. Prior to the runway's completion, the trip to Antarctica involved a ten-day journey by ship across the Southern Ocean from Hobart. The runway operates only during the Antarctic summer, and twenty to thirty flights per season are planned. The flights are used to transport scientists conducting Antarctic research, and are not available for tourist flights. However, since the opening of the runway, no more than 10 flights in one season have been achieved. This is primarily due to environmental conditions at the site, temperatures being warmer and causing melt of the runway, thus decreasing the window of opportunity to use the runway. As of January 2012, only four flights were planned for the summer season and all in February 2012.In 2015, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Australian Antarctic Division commenced cargo flights from Hobart International Airport to Wilkins Runway using C-17 Globemaster aircraft. The service will also be used for medical evacuations, if required. The C-17 was used as a faster and more frequent alternative to the Aurora Australis supply vessel.In March 2022, Wilkins reported 15 successful flights.\n\nAirlines and destinations\nSee also\nList of airports in territories of Australia\nList of airports in Antarctica\nAviation transport in Australia\nPassage 3:\nSebastian Cabot (explorer)\nSebastian Cabot (Italian and Venetian: Sebastiano Caboto, Italian: [seba\u02c8stja\u02d0no ka\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0to]; Spanish: Sebasti\u00e1n Caboto, Gaboto or Cabot; c. 1474 \u2013 c. December 1557) was a Venetian explorer, likely born in the Venetian Republic and a Venetian citizen. He was the son of Venetian explorer John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) and his Venetian wife Mattea.\nAfter his father's death, Cabot conducted his own voyages of discovery, seeking the Northwest Passage through North America on behalf of England. He later sailed for Spain, traveling to South America, where he explored the Rio de la Plata and established two new forts.\n\nEarly life and education\nAccounts differ as to Sebastian Cabot's place and date of birth.  The historian James Williamson reviewed the evidence for various given dates in the 1480s and concluded that Sebastian was born not later than 1484, the son of John Cabot, a Venetian citizen credited with Genoese or Gaetan origins by birth, and of Mattea Caboto, also Venetian. Late in life, Cabot himself told Englishman Richard Eden that he was born in Bristol, and that he travelled back to Venice with his parents at four years of age, returning again with his father, so that he was thought to be Venetian.  At another time, he told the Venetian ambassador at the court of Charles V, Gasparo Contarini (who noted it in his diary), that he was Venetian, educated in England. In 1515 Sebastian's friend Peter Martyr d'Anghiera wrote that Cabot was a Venetian by birth, but that his father (John Cabot) had taken him to England as a child.  His father had lived in Venice from 1461, as he received citizenship (which required 15 years' residency) in 1476. The Caboto family moved to England in 1495 if not before.\nSebastian, his elder brother Ludovico and his younger brother Santo were included by name with their father in the royal letters patent from King Henry VII of March 1496 authorizing their father's expeditions across the Atlantic. They are believed by some historians, including Rodney Skelton, still to have been minors since they were not mentioned in the 1498 patent their father also received. John Cabot sailed from Bristol on the small ship Matthew and reached the coast of a \"New Found Land\" on 24 June 1497. Historians have differed as to where Cabot landed, but two likely locations often suggested are Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.\n\n1494 Cabot scouting expedition\nAccording to Cartograf\u00eda Mar\u00edtima Hispana, Sebastian Cabot included a handwritten text in Latin on his famous map of North America (published in Antwerp, 1544) claiming to have discovered North America with his father in 1494, three years before his father's voyage. Sancho Gutierrez repeated this text in Castilian on his 1551 map. \nPlaced next to the border of North America, the text reads:\n\nThis land was discovered by Johannes Caboto, venetian and Sebastian Caboto, his son, in the year of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ MCCCCXCIV, 24th of June in the morning. They put to it the name 'prima terra vista' and [...] This big island was named Saint John, as it was discovered on Saint John holiday. People there wander wearing animal furs. They use bow and arrow to fight, javelins and darts and wooden batons and slings. This is a very sterile land, there are a lot of white bears and very big deers, big as horses, and many other animals. As well there are infinite fish: plaices, salmons, very long soles, 1 yard long  and many other varieties of fish. Most of them are called cod. And there are also black hawks, black as ravens, eagles, partridges and many other birds.\nThe year is stated as MCCCCXCIV (1494) in both hand-written versions. There cannot be confusion with the commonly accepted date for the Cabots' voyage, in 1497. Two suppositions can explain this. Sebastian Cabot and Sancho Guti\u00e9rrez may have changed the date in the middle of the sixteenth century. Intentional changes and inaccuracies were very common among geographers at the time, depending on the political interests of their sponsors. As Cabot was funded at the time of the map by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, he may have been interested in showing that the first travel to North America was in 1494 and thus funded by Castilians or by Portuguese, and not by English or French. By the time Cabot was sponsored by Germany and Spain, both England and France had started claiming shares of the New World in competition with Spain and Portugal.If Cabot and Guti\u00e9rrez stated the correct year, it would mean the Cabots sailed to North America on their own account, before proposing their services to England in 1496. No contemporaneous documentation for this has survived.\n\nEarly career with England and Spain\nIn 1504 Sebastian Cabot led an expedition from Bristol to the New World, using two ships: Jesus of Bristol and  Gabriel of Bristol. These were mastered by Richard Savery and Philip Ketyner, respectively, and fitted out by Robert Thorne and Hugh Elyot. They brought back a certain amount of salted fish, which suggests the voyage was at least partly commercial and that other expeditions may also have included fishing. Cabot was granted an annuity of \u00a310 on 3 April 1505 by Henry VII for services \"in and aboute the fyndynge of the new founde landes\".\n\nIn 1508\u201309 Cabot led one of the first expeditions to find a North-West passage through North America. He is generally credited with gaining \"the high latitudes,\" where he told of encountering fields of icebergs and reported an open passage of water, but was forced to turn back. Some later descriptions suggest that he may have reached as far as the entrance of Hudson Bay. According to Peter Martyr's 1516 account Sebastian then sailed south along the east coast of North America, passing the rich fisheries off the coast of Newfoundland, going on until he was 'almost in the latitude of Gibraltar' and 'almost the longitude of Cuba'. This would imply that he reached as far as the Chesapeake Bay, near what is now Washington, D.C.. Returning home 'he found the King dead, and his son cared little for such an enterprise'. This suggests Sebastian arrived back in England shortly after the death of Henry VII in April 1509 and the accession of Henry VIII, who did indeed show much less interest in the exploration of the New World than his father.\nBy 1512 Cabot was employed by Henry VIII as a cartographer, supplying the king with a map of Gascony and Guienne.   In the same year he accompanied the Marquess of Dorset's expedition to Spain, where he was made captain by Ferdinand V. Cabot believed that Spain was more interested in major exploration, but his hopes of getting Ferdinand's support were lost with the king's death. In the turmoil afterward, no plans would be made for new expeditions, and Cabot returned to England.\nThe scholar and translator\/civil servant Richard Eden, who came to know Cabot towards the end of his life, ascribed to the explorer 'the governance' of a voyage of c.1516 under English flag. This has been accepted and elaborated by a number of English writers, particularly of the turn of the nineteenth century. Rodney Skelton, author of Cabot's entry in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, connected Eden's text to a known expedition of 1517 which indeed aborted, but is not known to have involved Cabot; while the historian Alwyn Ruddock transferred Eden's story of the opposition to Cabot's plans of Thomas Spert, future master of the king's ship Mary Rose, to the explorer's voyage of 1508\u20139.Cabot's effort's in 1521 to bring together and lead an English discovery voyage to North America are well attested.  He had the support of Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey, and some offers of backing in money and ships from both Bristol and London merchants.  But the Drapers Company expressed their distrust of Sebastian, and offered only limited funds.  The response of other livery companies is unknown.  The project was abandoned, and Cabot returned to Spain.\n\nService to Spain\nBelieving that King Ferdinand II of Aragon was giving more financial support to exploration than the English, Cabot moved to Spain from England in 1512. When King Ferdinand died in 1516 it ended a period of exploration and Cabot returned to England.\nBy 1522, he was once again working for Spain as a member of the Council of the Indies and holding the rank of Pilot-Major, where he supervised naval and navigator training, etc. Cabot secretly offered his services to Venice in communications with the Council of Ten. He promised to undertake to find the Northwest Passage to China for Venice if they would receive him.Cabot was commissioned at the rank of captain general in Spain. On 4 March 1525, he was given command of a fleet that was to determine from astronomical observation the precise demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas, which defined the area of Spanish and Portuguese monopolies. He was also to convey settlers to the Molucca Islands in the Pacific, to strengthen Spanish claims in the spice islands. This voyage was officially noted as an expedition for the discovery of Tarshish, Ophir, Eastern Cathay, and Cipango (Japan). This expedition consisted of four ships with 250 men, and set sail from Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on 3 April 1526.\nBy this time the survivors of Magellan's expedition had completed their circumnavigation of the world, finding it larger than previously known. The voyage had increased pressure on Spain and Portugal to define their territories, as old boundaries seemed superseded by new data. Cabot was directed to cross the Pacific twice and he might have accomplished a second circumnavigation of the world. When Cabot landed with his expedition in Brazil, however, he heard of the rumours of the great wealth of the Incan king and the nearly-successful invasion of Aleixo Garcia. He abandoned his charge and explored the interior of the R\u00edo de la Plata along the northern border of present-day Argentina.\nCabot had already earned the disapproval of his crew by stranding the fleet in the doldrums and running the flagship aground off Santa Catarina Island. His decision regarding the R\u00edo de la Plata led to open resistance from Martin M\u00e9ndez (his lieutenant general), Miguel de Rodas (pilot of the Capitana), and Francisco de Rojas (the captain of one of the other vessels). He dealt with the mutiny by marooning these men and other officers on Santa Catarina Island, where they are believed to have died.\nCabot sailed into the wide R\u00edo de la Plata and spent five months exploring the estuary. He established a fort called San Salvador at the confluence of the Uruguay and the R\u00edo San Salvador. This was the first Spanish settlement in modern-day Uruguay.\nLeaving the two larger ships there, he sailed up the Paran\u00e1 River in the brigantine and a galley constructed at Santa Catarina. His party constructed a small fort called Santo or Esp\u00edritu Santo at the confluence of the Paran\u00e1 and the R\u00edo Carcara\u00f1\u00e1. This was the first Spanish settlement in present-day Argentina; the town of Gaboto was later constructed nearby and named in his honour. Losing 18 men to an ambush, Cabot returned to San Salvador, passing Diego Garc\u00eda's expedition as he went.\nAs a result of this encounter, Cabot sent one ship back to Spain.  The Trinidad sailed on 8 July 1528 with his reports, accusations against the mutineers, and requests for further aid. In the spring of 1529, he returned upriver to Esp\u00edritu Santo, which he discovered had been overwhelmed and burnt by the Indians during his absence. He recovered the cannon and returned to San Salvador.\nAt a council on 6 August 1529, he decided to return to Spain. Cabot sailed with Garc\u00eda to S\u00e3o Vicente. Purchasing 50 slaves there, he traveled along the coast of Brazil before heading across the Atlantic, reaching Seville on 22 July 1530, with one ship and 24 men.\nHe was arraigned on charges from the Crown, by Rojas, and by the families of Rodas and M\u00e9ndez. He was condemned by the Council of the Indies on charges of disobedience, misadministration, and causing the death of officers under his command. He was sentenced to heavy fines and a two-year banishment to Oran in North Africa.During these proceedings, however, the Emperor of Spain had been absent in Germany. Upon his return, Cabot presented him with descriptions of the region. Although no pardon is recorded and the fines were still paid, it is known that Cabot never went into exile.  He retained the post of pilot-major of Spain until 1547. Without losing either title or pension, he left Spain and returned to England.\n\nLater years\nIn the year 1553, Cabot discussed a voyage to China and re-joining the service of Charles V with Jean Scheyfve, the king's ambassador in England. In the meantime Cabot had reopened negotiations with Venice, but he reached no agreement with that republic. After this he acted as an advisor for \"English ventures for discovery of the Northwest Passage. He became governor of the Muscovy Company in 1553 and, along with John Dee, helped it prepare for an expedition led by Sir Hugh Willoughby and Richard Chancellor. He was made life-governor of the \"Company of Merchant Adventurers\", and equipped the 1557 expedition of Steven Borough. By February 1557, he was replaced as governor of the Muscovy Company. He was recorded as receiving a quarterly pension, which he was first paid in person. Someone picked up for him in June and September 1557, and no one was paid in December, suggesting that he had died by then.\n\nMarriages and family\nCabot married Joanna (later recorded as Juana in Spanish documents.) They had children before 1512, the year he entered Spanish service. That year, he returned to London to bring his wife and family to Seville. By 14 September 1514, his wife was dead. Among his children was a daughter Elizabeth. An unnamed daughter was recorded as dying in 1533.In Spain Cabot married again, in 1523, to Catalina de Medrano, widow of the conquistador Pedro Barba. It is not known if the marriage produced offspring. But since the Spanish wills of both Catalina (1547) and Sebastian (1548) name nieces of Catalina as their heirs, it is unlikely that by the time of Catalina's death, the pair had children surviving from their marriage. Catalina died on 2 Sep 1547.\n\nReputation\nFrom the later sixteenth century until the mid-nineteenth century, historians believed that Sebastian Cabot, rather than his father John, led the famous Bristol expeditions of the later 1490s, which resulted in the European discovery, or rediscovery after the Vikings, of North America. This error seems to have been attributed to Sebastian's accounts in his old age. The result was that the influential geographical writer Richard Hakluyt represented his father John Cabot as a figurehead for the expeditions and suggested that Sebastian actually led them. When new archival finds in the nineteenth century demonstrated that this was not the case, Sebastian was denigrated, disparaged by Henry Harrisse, in particular, as a man who willfully appropriated his father's achievements and represented them as his own. Because of this, Sebastian received much less attention in the twentieth century. But other documentary finds, as summarized above, have demonstrated that he did lead some exploratory voyages from Bristol in the first decade of the sixteenth century.A. C. H. Smith wrote a biographical novel about him, Sebastian The Navigator (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1985).\n\nHonors\nA 19th-century bronze relief of Cabot and Henry VII by William Theed is located in the British Houses of Parliament.\n\nNotes\nSources\nKarrow, Robert W.

De Houtman assisted fellow Dutch navigator Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser with astronomical observations during the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies from 1595 until 1597. In 1598, de Houtman sailed on a second expedition led by his brother, Cornelis de Houtman, who was killed during the voyage. Frederick was imprisoned by the Sultan of Aceh, Alauddin Riayat Syah, in northern Sumatra.\nHe used his two years of captivity\u2014from September 1599 until August 1601\u2014to study the local Malay language and to make astronomical observations. These observations supplemented those made by Keyser on the first expedition. The constellations formed from their observations were first published in 1597 or 1598 on a globe by Petrus Plancius, and later globes incorporated adjustments based on De Houtman's later observations.Credit for these constellations is generally assigned jointly to Keyser, De Houtman, and Plancius, though some of the underlying stars were known beforehand. The constellations are also widely associated with Johann Bayer, who included them in his celestial atlas, Uranometria, in 1603. After De Houtman's return to Europe, De Houtman published his stellar observations in an appendix to his dictionary and grammar of the Malayan and Malagasy languages.\n\nAustralia\nIn 1619 De Houtman sailed in the Dutch East India Company ship Dordrecht, along with Jacob Dedel in the Amsterdam. They sighted the Australian coast near present-day Perth, which they called Dedelsland. After sailing northwards along the coast he encountered and only narrowly avoided a group of shoals, subsequently called the Houtman Abrolhos.\nDe Houtman then made landfall in the region known as Eendrachtsland, which the explorer Dirk Hartog had encountered earlier. In his journal, De Houtman identified these coasts as Locach, mentioned by Marco Polo to have been a country far south of China and indicated as such on maps by cartographers Plancius and Linschoten.\n\nSee also\nJohn Davis \u2013 English explorer who accompanied De Houtman on the first East Indies' expedition as its pilot\nPassage 5:\nPaula Santiago\nPaula Santiago (born 2007 in Vigo) is a Gallega mixed media digital artist whose works have been displayed at the Ap\u00f3stol Santiago and several galleries in Galicia and North America.

His 1497 voyage to the coast of North America under the commission of Henry VII of England is the earliest known European exploration of coastal North America since the Norse visits to Vinland in the eleventh century.\nTo mark the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Cabot's expedition, both the Canadian and British governments elected Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland as representing Cabot's first landing site. However, alternative locations have also been proposed.\n\nName and origins\nCabot is known today as Giovanni Caboto in Italian, Zuan Caboto in Venetian, Jean Cabot in French, and John Cabot in English. This resulted from a once-ubiquitous European tradition of nativizing names in local documents, something often adhered to by the actual persons themselves. (Many European names have root origins but diverged culturally, e.g. Charles rendered in German becomes Carl or Karl, and Jaques in English becomes Jack.) In Venice Cabot signed his name as \"Zuan Chabotto\", Zuan being a form of John typical to Venice. He continued to use this form in England, at least among Italians. He was referred to by his Italian banker in London as \"Giovanni\", in the only known contemporaneous document to use this version of his first name.Cabot was born in Italy, the son of Giulio Caboto and his wife; he had a brother Piero. Gaeta (in the Province of Latina) and Castiglione Chiavarese (in the Province of Genoa) have both been proposed as birthplaces. The main evidence for Gaeta are records of a Caboto family residing there until the mid-15th century, but ceasing to be traceable after 1443.Pedro de Ayala, the Spanish envoy and Cabot's contemporary in London, described him in a letter to the Spanish Crown in 1498 as \"another Genoese like Columbus\". John Cabot's son, Sebastian, said his father originally came from Genoa. In 1476 Cabot was made a citizen of the Republic of Venice, which required a minimum of fifteen years' residency in the city; thus he must have lived in Venice since at least 1461.\n\nEarly life\nCabot may have been born slightly earlier than 1450, which is the approximate date most commonly given for his birth. In 1471 Cabot was accepted into the religious confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista. Since this was one of the city's prestigious confraternities, his acceptance suggests that he was already a respected member of the community.\nOnce he gained full Venetian citizenship in 1476, Cabot would have been eligible to engage in maritime trade, including the trade to the eastern Mediterranean that was the source of much of Venice's wealth. He presumably entered this trade shortly thereafter. A 1483 document refers to his selling a slave in Crete whom he had acquired while in the territories of the Sultan of Egypt, which then comprised most of what is now Israel, Syria and Lebanon. This is not sufficient to prove Cabot's later assertion that he had visited Mecca, which he said in 1497 to the Milanese ambassador in London. In this Mediterranean trade, he may have acquired better knowledge of the origins of the Eastern merchandise he would have been dealing in (such as spices and silks) than most Europeans at that time.\n\"Zuan Cabotto\" is mentioned in a variety of Venetian records of the late 1480s. These indicate that by 1484 he was married to Mattea and already had multiple sons. Cabot's sons were Ludovico, Sebastian and Sancto. The Venetian sources contain references to Cabot's being involved in house building in the city. He may have relied on this experience when seeking work later in Spain as a civil engineer.\n\nCabot appears to have gotten into financial trouble in the late 1480s and left Venice as an insolvent debtor by 5 November 1488. He moved to Valencia, Spain, where his creditors attempted to have him arrested by sending a lettera di raccomandazione a giustizia (\"a letter of recommendation to justice\") to the authorities. While in Valencia, \"John Cabot Montecalunya\" (as he is referred to in local documents) proposed plans for improvements to the harbour. These proposals were rejected, however. Early in 1494 he moved on to Seville, where he proposed, was contracted to build and, for five months, worked on the construction of a stone bridge over the Guadalquivir river. This project was abandoned following a decision of the City Council on 24 December 1494. After this Cabot appears to have sought support in Seville and Lisbon for an Atlantic expedition, before moving to London to seek funding and political support. He probably reached England in mid-1495.\n\nSponsorship\nCabot sought financing and royal patronage in England, in contrast to Columbus' expeditions being financed mainly by the Spanish crown. Cabot planned to depart to the west from a northerly latitude in search of a northern passage to Asia.Historians had thought that, on arrival in England, Cabot went to Bristol, a major maritime centre, to seek financial backers. This was the only English city to have had a history of undertaking exploratory expeditions into the Atlantic. Cabot's royal patent, issued by the Crown in 1496, stated that all expeditions should be undertaken from Bristol, so his primary financial supporters were probably based in that city. In any case, it also stipulated that the commerce resulting from any discoveries must be conducted with England alone, with goods only being brought in through Bristol. Although those goods would be free of other duties, the King was to receive one-fifth of the profit. This would have made Bristol into a monopoly port, with sole right to engage in colonial trade. In stating this, Henry VII of England was presumably influenced by Iberian practices: Portugal having made Lisbon into such a monopoly port, while Spain was in the process of doing the same thing with Seville.\nIn the late 20th century, British historian Alwyn Ruddock found documentation that Cabot went first to London, where he received some financial backing from its Italian community. She suggested one patron was Father Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis, an Augustinian friar who was also the deputy to Adriano Castellesi, the papal tax collector. Ruddock also suggested that Carbonariis accompanied Cabot's 1498 expedition. She further suggested that the friar, on good terms with the King, introduced the explorer to King Henry VII. Beyond this, Ruddock stated that Cabot received a loan from an Italian banking house in London. As Ruddock ordered the destruction of all her research notes on her death in 2005, scholars have had to duplicate her research and rediscover documents. The Cabot Project was formed at the University of Bristol in 2009 to research Cabot and the Bristol expeditions. Francesco Guidi Bruscoli, of the University of Florence, found some of Ruddock's documentation, confirming that Cabot received money in March 1496 from the Bardi family banking firm of Florence. The bankers located in London provided fifty nobles (\u00a316 13s. 4d.) to support Cabot's expedition to \"go and find the new land\". This payment from the Florentine merchants would have represented a substantial contribution, although it was not enough to completely finance the expedition.On 5 March 1496 Henry VII gave Cabot and his three sons letters patent with the following charge for exploration:\n\n... free authority, faculty and power to sail to all parts, regions, and coasts of the eastern, western and northern sea, under our banners, flags, and ensigns, with five ships or vessels of whatsoever burden and quality they may be, and with so many and with such mariners and men as they may wish to take with them in the said ships, at their own proper costs and charges, to find, discover and investigate whatsoever islands, countries, regions or provinces of heathens and infidels, in whatsoever part of the world placed, which before this time were unknown to all Christians. Those who received such patents had the right to assign them to third parties for execution. His sons are believed to have still been minors at that time.\n\nExpeditions\nCabot went to Bristol to arrange preparations for his voyage. Bristol was the second-largest seaport in England. From 1480 onward it had supplied several expeditions to look for the mythical Hy-Brasil. According to Celtic legend, this island lay somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. There was a widespread belief among merchants in the port that Bristol men had discovered the island at an earlier date but had then lost track of it. In a private letter to a colleague (Quinn), Ruddock maintained that she had found evidence in Italian archives that Bristol men had discovered North America before 1470. As the island was believed to be a source of brazilwood (from which a valuable red dye could be obtained), merchants had economic incentive to find it.\n\nFirst voyage\nLittle was recorded of Cabot's first voyage. What is known as the \"John Day letter\", written by John Day, alias Hugh Say, a Bristol merchant originally of London, was sent during the winter of 1497\u201398 to an addressee believed to be Christopher Columbus. The letter refers briefly to this voyage but writes mostly about the second, 1497 expedition. Day noted: \"Since your Lordship wants information relating to the first voyage, here is what happened: he went with one ship, his crew confused him, he was short of supplies and ran into bad weather, and he decided to turn back.\" Since Cabot received his royal patent in March 1496, it is believed that he made his first voyage that summer.\n\nSecond voyage\nSources\nInformation about the 1497 voyage comes mostly from four short letters and an entry in a 1565 chronicle of the city of Bristol (then often spelt Bristow).  The chronicle entry for 1496\u201397 says in full:\nThis year, on St. John the Baptist's Day [24 June 1497], the land of America was found by the Merchants of Bristow in a shippe of Bristowe, called the Mathew; the which said ship departed from the port of Bristowe, the second day of May, and came home again the 6th of August next following.\nThe John Day letter of winter 1497\u201398 provides considerable information about Cabot's second voyage. Day is believed to have been familiar with the key figures of the expedition and thus able to report on it. If the lands Cabot had discovered lay west of the meridian laid down in the Treaty of Tordesillas, or if he intended to sail further west, Columbus would probably have believed that these voyages challenged his monopoly rights for westward exploration.In addition to these letters, Alwyn Ruddock claimed to have found another, written on 10 August 1497 by the London-based bankers of Fr. Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis. This letter has yet to be found. From various written comments made by Ruddock, the letter did not appear to contain a detailed account of the voyage. Ruddock said the letter contained \"new evidence supporting the claim that seamen of Bristol had already discovered land across the ocean before John Cabot's arrival in England.\" She contended that Bristol seamen had reached North America two decades before Cabot's expedition.\n\nDetails of the voyage\nThe known sources do not concur on all aspects of the events, and none can be assumed to be entirely reliable. Cabot was described as having one \"little ship\", of 50 tons' burden, called Matthew of Bristol (according to the 1565 chronicle). It was said to be laden with sufficient supplies for \"seven or eight months\". The ship departed in May with a crew of 18 to 20 men. They included an unnamed Burgundian (modern-day Netherlands) and a Genoese barber, who presumably accompanied the expedition as the ship's surgeon (barbers in that era also routinely performed dentistry and minor surgery).\nIt is likely that two ranking Bristol merchants were part of the expedition. One was William Weston, who had not been identified as part of Cabot's expedition before the discovery of a new document in the late 20th century by historian Margaret Condon. In 2009, historian Evan Jones published this document: a letter from Henry VII ordering the suspension of legal proceedings against Weston because it was the King's intent that Weston would shortly undertake a voyage for the King to the \"new founde land\". This was probably the voyage under Cabot's patent, making William Weston the first Englishman to lead an expedition to North America. In 2018, Condon and Jones published a further article that showed that Weston and Cabot had been jointly rewarded by the king in January 1498, suggesting that the explorers were working together before the start of the second voyage. The same article revealed that Weston received a \u00a330 reward after he returned from his successful 1499 voyage.\n\nLeaving Bristol, the expedition sailed past Ireland and across the Atlantic, making landfall somewhere on the coast of North America on 24 June 1497. The exact location of the landfall has long been disputed, with different communities vying for the honor. Historians have proposed Cape Bonavista and St. John's, Newfoundland; Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; Labrador; and Maine as possibilities. Since the discovery of the John Day letter in the 1950s, it seems most likely that the initial landfall was either on Newfoundland or nearby Cape Breton Island. This is because Day's letter implies that the coastline explored in 1497 lay between the latitudes of Bordeaux, France and Dursey Head in southern Ireland. The initial landfall seems to have taken place close to the southern latitude, with the expedition returning home after reaching the northern one.\n\nLanding\nFor the 500th-anniversary celebrations, the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom designated Cape Bonavista in Newfoundland as the \"official\" landing place. Here in 1997, Queen Elizabeth II along with members of the Italian and Canadian governments greeted the replica Matthew of Bristol, following her celebratory crossing of the Atlantic.Cabot is reported to have landed only once during the expedition and did not advance \"beyond the shooting distance of a crossbow\". Pasqualigo and Day both state that the expedition made no contact with any native people; the crew found the remains of a fire, a human trail, nets, and a wooden tool. The crew appeared to have remained on land just long enough to take on fresh water; they also raised the Venetian and Papal banners, claiming the land for the King of England and recognising the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church. After this landing, Cabot spent some weeks \"discovering the coast\", with most \"discovered after turning back\".\n\nCelebration\nOn return to Bristol, Cabot rode to London to report to the king. On 10 August 1497, he was given a reward of \u00a310\u2014equivalent to about two years' pay for an ordinary labourer or craftsman. The explorer was f\u00eated; Soncino wrote on 23 August that, similar to Christopher Columbus, Cabot \"is called the Great Admiral, and vast honour is paid to him and he goes dressed in silk, and these English run after him like mad\". Such adulation was short-lived, for over the next few months the king's attention was occupied by the second Cornish uprising of 1497. \nOnce Henry's throne was secure, he gave more thought to Cabot. On 26 September, just a few days after the collapse of the revolt, the king made an award of \u00a32 to Cabot. On 13 December 1497, the explorer was awarded a pension (or salary) of \u00a320 per year. This was to be payable from customs receipts collected in Bristol. The pension was backdated to March 1497, to make clear that Cabot was in the king's service at the time of his expedition. Despite the royal grant, Bristol's customs officers initially refused to pay Cabot his pension, forcing the explorer to obtain an additional warrant from the king.  On 3 February 1498, Cabot was given new letters patent covering the voyage and to help him prepare another expedition. In March and April, the king also advanced a number of loans to Lancelot Thirkill of London, Thomas Bradley, and John Cair, who were to accompany Cabot's new expedition.\n\nFinal voyage\nThe Great Chronicle of London (1189\u20131512) reports that Cabot departed with a fleet of five ships from Bristol at the beginning of May 1498, one of which had been prepared by the king. Some of the ships were said to be carrying merchandise, including cloth, caps, lace points, and other \"trifles\". This suggests that Cabot intended to engage in trade on this expedition. The Spanish envoy in London reported in July that one of the ships had been caught in a storm and been forced to land in Ireland, but that Cabot and the other four ships had continued on.For centuries, no other records were found (or at least published) that relate to this expedition; it was long believed that Cabot and his fleet were lost at sea. But at least one of the men scheduled to accompany the expedition, Lancelot Thirkill, is recorded as living in London in 1501.It is not known whether Cabot died during the voyage, returned safely and died shortly after, or arrived in the Americas and chose to remain there, perhaps remaining with the Indigenous people in a similar manner to \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9.The historian Alwyn Ruddock worked on Cabot and his era for 35 years. She suggested that Cabot and his expedition successfully returned to England in the spring of 1500. She claimed their return followed an epic two-year exploration of the east coast of North America, south into the Chesapeake Bay area and perhaps as far as the Spanish territories in the Caribbean. Her evidence included the well-known world map of the Spanish cartographer Juan de la Cosa. His chart included the North American coast and seas \"discovered by the English\" between 1497 and 1500.Ruddock suggested that Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis and the other friars who accompanied the 1498 expedition had stayed in Newfoundland and founded a mission. If Carbonariis founded a settlement in North America, it would have been the first Christian settlement on the continent and may have included a church, the only medieval church to have been built there.The Cabot Project at the University of Bristol was organized in 2009 to search for the evidence on which Ruddock's claims rest, as well as to undertake related studies of Cabot and his expeditions. The lead researchers on the project, Evan Jones and Margaret Condon, claim to have found further evidence to support aspects of Ruddock's case, including some of the information she intended to use to argue for a successful return of the 1498 expedition to Bristol. These appear to place John Cabot in London by May 1500, although Jones and Condon have yet to publish their documentation.\nThe project is collaborating on an archaeological excavation at the community of Carbonear, Newfoundland, located at Conception Bay and believed the likely location for Carbonariis's possible mission settlement. The Archaeology of Historic Carbonear Project, carried out by Memorial University of Newfoundland, has conducted summer fieldwork each season since 2011. So far, it has found evidence of planter habitation since the late 17th century and of trade with Spain through Bilbao, including a Spanish coin minted in Peru.\n\nAdditional English voyages\nRuddock claimed that William Weston of Bristol, a supporter of Cabot, undertook an independent expedition to North America in 1499, sailing north from Newfoundland up to the Hudson Strait. If correct, this was probably the first Northwest Passage expedition. In 2009, Jones confirmed that William Weston (who was not previously known to have been involved) led an expedition from Bristol [with royal support] to the \"new found land\" in 1499 or 1500, making him the first Englishman to lead the exploration of North America. This find has changed the understanding of English roles in exploration of that continent. In 2018, Condon and Jones published a further article about William Weston. This revealed that Weston and Cabot had received rewards from King Henry VII in January 1498, following a royal audience, thereby confirming that the two explorers were involved by this stage. Condon and Jones also revealed that in 1500 the King rewarded Weston \u00a330 for \"his expenses about the finding of the new land\".King Henry VII continued to support exploration from Bristol. The king granted Hugh Eliot, Robert Thorne, and his son a bounty of \u00a320 in January 1502 for purchasing the Gabriel, a ship for an expedition voyage that summer. Later in 1502 or early 1503, he paid Eliot a reward of \u00a3100 for a voyage, or voyages, in \"2 ships to the Isle of new finding,\" as Newfoundland was called. This amount was larger than any previously accounted for in royal support of the explorations. Around this time the Bristol-based explorers established a formal company, backed by Letters Patent, called the Company Adventurers to the New Found Land. This conducted further expeditions in 1503 and 1504.In 1508\u201309, Sebastian Cabot undertook a final voyage to North America from Bristol. According to Peter Martyr's 1516 account, this expedition explored a section of the coast from the Hudson Bay to about Chesapeake Bay. Following his return to England in 1509, Sebastian found that his sponsor, Henry VII, had died and that the new king, Henry VIII, had little interest in westward exploration.\n\nFamily\nCabot married Mattea around 1470, and had issue including three sons:\nLudovico Caboto\nSebastiano Caboto\nSanto Caboto\n\nSebastian Cabot's voyages\nSebastian Cabot, one of John's sons, also became an explorer, later making at least one voyage to North America. In 1508 he was searching for the Northwest Passage. Nearly two decades later, he sailed to South America for Spain to repeat Ferdinand Magellan's voyage around the world. He became diverted by searching for silver along the R\u00edo de la Plata (1525\u20131528) in Argentina.\n\nLegacy and honors\nGiovanni Caboto (1762), painting at Ducal Palace, Venice.\nCabot Tower (1897) in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Cabot's voyage.\nCabot Tower, in Bristol, England.

Janszoon served in the Dutch East Indies in the periods 1603\u20131611 and 1612\u20131616, including as governor of Fort Henricus on the island of Solor. During his voyage of 1605\u20131606, he became the first European known to have seen the coast of Australia.\n\nEarly life\nWillem Janszoon (Willem Jansz) was born around 1570 as the son of Jan (c.\u20091540), but nothing more is known of his early life or of his parents.\nJanszoon is first recorded as entering into the service of the Oude compagnie, one of the predecessors of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), in 1598 as a mate aboard the Hollandia, part of the second fleet under Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck, dispatched by the Dutch to the Dutch East Indies. Around 1600 he became the father of Jan Willemsz before setting sail again on 5 May 1601, for the East Indies as master of the Lam, one of three ships in the fleet of Joris van Spilbergen.Janszoon sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on 18 December 1603, as captain of the Duyfken (or Duijfken, meaning \"Little Dove\"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of Steven van der Hagen. When the other ships left Java, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in \"the great land of New Guinea and other East and Southlands\".\n\nExploration and discovery\nFirst voyage to Australia\nOn 18 November 1605, the Duyfken sailed from Bantam to the coast of western New Guinea. After that, Janszoon crossed the eastern end of the Arafura Sea into the Gulf of Carpentaria, without being aware of the existence of Torres Strait. The Duyfken was actually in Torres Strait in February 1606, a few months before Spanish explorer Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres sailed through it. On 26 February 1606, Janszoon made landfall at the Pennefather River on the western shore of Cape York in Queensland, near what is now the town of Weipa. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some 320 km (200 mi) of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea.\nFinding the land swampy and the people inhospitable (ten of his men were killed on various shore expeditions), Janszoon decided to return at a place he named Cape Keerweer (\"Turnabout\"), south of Albatross Bay, and arrived back at Bantam in June 1606. He called the land he had discovered Nieu Zelant, or Nieu Zeelandt, after the Dutch province of Zeeland, but the name was not adopted, and was later used by Dutch cartographers for New Zealand.\nIn 1607, Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge sent Janszoon to Ambon and Banda. In 1611, Janszoon returned to the Netherlands, believing that the south coast of New Guinea was joined to the land along which he had sailed, and Dutch maps reproduced that error for many years. Though there have been suggestions that earlier navigators from China, France, or Portugal may have discovered parts of Australia earlier, the Duyfken is the first Eurasian vessel definitely known to have done so.\n\nSecond voyage to Australia\nJanszoon reported that on 31 July 1618, he had landed on an island at 22\u00b0 South with a length of 22 miles and 240 miles SSE of the Sunda Strait. This is generally interpreted as a description of the peninsula from Point Cloates (22\u00b043\u2032S 113\u00b040\u2032E) to North West Cape (21\u00b047\u2032S 114\u00b009\u2032E) on the Western Australian coast, which Janszoon presumed was an island, without fully circumnavigating it.\n\nPolitical life\nAround 1617\u20131618, he was back in the Netherlands and was appointed as a member of the Council of the Indies. He served as admiral of the Dutch Defence fleet. Janszoon was awarded a gold chain worth 1,000 guilders in 1619 for his part in capturing four ships of the British East India Company near Tiku on West Sumatra, which had aided the Javanese in their defence of the town of Jakarta against the Dutch. In 1620, he was one of the negotiators with the English. In a combined fleet, they sailed to Manila to prevent Chinese merchants dealing with the Spanish. Janszoon became vice-admiral, and the year later admiral. Near the end of his life, Janszoon served as governor of Banda (1623\u20131627). He returned to Batavia in June 1627 and soon afterwards, as admiral of a fleet of eight vessels, went on a diplomatic mission to India. On 4 December 1628, he sailed for Holland and on 16 July 1629, reported on the state of the Indies at The Hague. He was now probably about sixty years old and ready to retire from his strenuous and successful career in the service of his country. Nothing is known of his last days, but he is thought to have died in 1630.\n\nRecords\nThe original journal and log made during Janszoon\u2019s 1606 voyage have been lost. The Duyfken chart, which shows the location of the first landfall in Australia by the Duyfken, had a better fate. It was still in existence in Amsterdam when Hessel Gerritszoon made his map of the Pacific in 1622, and placed the Duyfken geography upon it, thus providing us with the first map to contain any part of Australia. The chart was still in existence around 1670, when a copy was made. This eventually went to the Imperial Library in Vienna and remained forgotten for two hundred years. The map is part of the Atlas Blaeu Van der Hem, brought to Vienna in 1730 by Prince Eugene of Savoy. The information from his charts was included in the marble and copper maps of the hemispheres on the floor of The Citizens' Hall of the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nPennell Coast\nPennell Coast is that portion of the coast of Antarctica between Cape Williams and Cape Adare. To the west of Cape Williams lies Oates Coast, and to the east and south of Cape Adare lies Borchgrevink Coast. Named by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) in 1961 after Lieutenant Harry Pennell, Royal Navy, commander of the Terra Nova, the expedition ship of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910\u201313. Pennell engaged in oceanographic work in the Ross Sea during this period. In February 1911 he sailed along this coast in exploration and an endeavor to land the Northern Party led by Lieutenant Victor Campbell.\nThe name is also used more loosely to refer to both the coast itself and the hinterland extending south to the watershed of the Southern Cross Mountains to the southeast and the Usarp Mountains to the west.\nMajor features of the coast include the 250-kilometer long Rennick Glacier (one of Antarctica's largest glaciers), the Anare Mountains, and the northern ends of the Bowers and Admiralty mountain ranges. Inland, the land is dominated by numerous smaller mountain ranges (notably the Freyberg Mountains and the Concord Mountains), and by two large n\u00e9v\u00e9s, the Rennick N\u00e9v\u00e9 and the Evans N\u00e9v\u00e9\n\nOther Features\nDwyer Escarpment\nJago Nunataks\nPassage 9:\nGibbs Point\nGibbs Point, a rock point on the Antarctic Peninsula, the most northern area of the continent of Antarctica, was named for African American Antarctic explorer, George W.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nKody Lostroh\nKody Lostroh (born September 18, 1985) is an American former professional rodeo cowboy who specialized in bull riding. He was the 2009 Professional Bull Riders (PBR) world champion.\n\nBackground\nKody Lostroh was born on September 18, 1985 in Longmont, Colorado. Lostroh watched a video of Cheyenne Frontier Days so many times that his mother Dena Schlutz signed him up to ride at the Boulder County Fair in 1993, when he was seven years old. He won a Little Britches Rodeo National Bull Riding title in 2003 and the Colorado High School Rodeo Bull Riding Championship three consecutive years. Kody was attending the University of Wyoming, but quit after a semester to pursue the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour.\n\nCareer\nIn 2005, Lostroh won the PBR Rookie of the Year award and in 2009, he won the PBR Built Ford Tough Series World Championship. He qualified for the PBR World Finals 10 consecutive times (2005 to 2014). Lostroh suffered multiple injuries throughout his career. For example, Lostroh injured his riding hand in January 2014 and missed most of the first half of that season. In August 2017, he was considering retirement to spend more time with his two daughters, when he began experiencing significant health problems. He was eventually diagnosed with a tumor wrapped around his carotid artery, requiring surgery. He went back to the PBR but still had some reservations.On March 29, 2018, Lostroh announced his retirement from bull riding.In 2022, Lostroh became the assistant coach to head coach Cord McCoy of the Oklahoma Freedom; one of eight bull riding teams of the PBR\u2019s Team Series, which debuted that year. In September of that year, the Oklahoma Freedom won the event at Cowboy Days in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the hometown event of rival team, the Carolina Cowboys. The very next weekend, the Freedom won their own hometown event at Freedom Fest in Oklahoma City. They were the first team to win their hometown event. The Freedom ended up finishing in fourth place at the conclusion of the inaugural PBR Team Series season.\n\nPersonal life\nHe raises bucking bulls in Ault, Colorado, at the Shield of Faith Cattle Company. As of 2016, Lostroh and his wife, Candace, who is a barrel racer, live in Ault, Colorado, with their two daughters.\nPassage 2:\nBones (bull)\nBones #05 (born March 31, 2003) is an American former bucking bull. He competed in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) circuit and was the PBR World Champion Bull in 2008 and 2010. Two other bulls, Dillinger and Smooth Operator, have also won the title two times. Three other bulls, Little Yellow Jacket, Bushwacker, and Bruiser won the award three times. In 2011, the year after Bones won the 2010 World Champion Bull title, when he was 7 years old, his owner, Tom Teague announced his retirement from the sport. Bones lives on Teague's ranch in his retirement. In 2014, the bull was inducted into the PBR Brand of Honor.\n\nBackground\nBones was born on March 31, 2003. Bones grew up at Teague Bucking Bulls in Graham, North Carolina. Teague was the 2006 PBR Co-Stock Contractor of the Year.  Bones got his name when one of Tom Teague's workers described him as a \"bag of bones.\" Lee Holt said, \"He was the poorest little thing.\" He was too small to take care of himself with the other calves so they moved him to be alone in the barn. Through the years, he grew into a brawny 1,550 pounds (700 kg) pounds. He is a black bull with a white face.Bones' sire was 263 Bone Collector. Bone Collector's jumping prowess while bucking was well known. Bones' paternal grandsire was 64 Psycho. His mother is a daughter of Whitewater, a well-known breeding bull. Whitewater's sire was No. 34 Oscar's Velvet, the 1983 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Bucking Bull of the Year. Oscar's Velvet was the son of Oscar, a ProRodeo Hall of Fame bucking bull. Bones is also a half-brother of the retired and highly ranked bucking bull Troubadour owned by Julio Moreno.Teague raised Bones and retained full ownership of the bull throughout his bucking career and into retirement. This was not the first time Teague had ownership in a World Champion Bull, as he also had part ownership in world champion bulls Little Yellow Jacket, Mossy Oak Mudslinger, and Big Bucks, including gaining full ownership of Little Yellow Jacket for most of his retirement. This was, however, the first time Teague retained full ownership in a bull that he raised himself. He intended to keep Teague Bucking Bulls continuing in that direction, but decided in April 2014 to leave the stock contractor business. However, in an interview with the PBR, Teague stated that he would continue his position on the board of directors and aid them in \"taking the sport to the next level.\"\n\nCareer\nOne of the ways that Teague exercised Bones was in a circular sand pit that he had made, where he installed a type of hot walker sometimes used for horses. Once an animal was inside, there were walls that moved around in a circular direction, forcing the bull to walk in between them. Teague compared working in deep sand to walking on the beach \u2013 it took more effort than walking on hard ground.Bones bucked in the PBR, mostly on the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS), the elite series of the circuit, for four seasons, but only three were complete seasons, as he only bucked at one BFTS event in 2007. Two-time PBR World Champion bull rider Justin McBride stated that Bones is the \"real deal\". He said Bones is one of only two bulls he got on more than once who bucked him off each time\u2014he never got a qualified ride on Bones. McBride first got on the bull at an event at Columbus, Ohio, in 2008 when Bones was a fairly unknown five-year-old. Bones bucked him off.\n\n2008 title\nBones qualified for the PBR World Finals his first time in 2008. McBride again picked him in round two and Bones bucked him off faster than in their first meeting. According to McBride, Bones had gotten better and \"handed him his hat\". Bones bucked off all three riders at his first finals. Bones made what became his trademark set of bucking moves, going up high and bringing the rider over his shoulder and then down. In 4.7 seconds, McBride bucked off Bones. \"It had been a long time since a bull had treated me that way,\" McBride said. For the other two riders, in round four Zack Brown bucked off Bones in 2.8 seconds, and in the final round 2008 World Champion Guilherme Marchi bucked off in 4 seconds. Bones finished the evening with bull scores of 47 points, 46 points, and 47.25 points. His bull score of 47.25 points was a career best. Bulls are scored from 1 to 50 points, half of the total score. The bull rider gets the other half of the score; together it totals up to 100. These bull scores were high enough to win the 2008 World Champion Bull title.\n\nBetting events\nAn event between Bones and J.B. Mauney on February 13, 2009, was billed as the best bull against the best bull rider. Tom Teague claimed that \"no cowboy wearing spurs could stay on his star bull for the eight-second count\", resulting in extensive comments from fans and stock contractors on the PBR site. The event took place that night as part of the PBR Express Classic event at the Ford Center, now known as Chesapeake Energy Arena, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Teague pitted his unridden bull Bones head to head against the current world standings leader and 2013 world champion with a prize of $20,000. Bones had been 13\u20130 on the BFTS circuit so far. Bones had bucked off, or \"dusted\", both McBride and 2002 World Champion Ednei Caminhas twice. He had dusted Marchi three times, and the last time, Marchi lost the opportunity to win $20,000; Teague bet that much against Marchi. Since Mauney was the world standings leader, he felt \"slighted\" that he was not offered an opportunity at Bones when Marchi got two. When Marchi fell the third time, Mauney asked Teague for a turn. Mauney would earn $20,000 if he became the first to make a successful eight-second qualifying ride on Bones, while Teague bet he would hit the dust in four seconds. Mauney succeeded. He rode Bones for a qualifying time and scored 93.5 points out of a maximum of 100. Although there was a great deal of hype about the event that weekend, Mauney stated that he just did what he did with every bull, \"kept my hand shut and held on\". Teague said he was happy to see Mauney prove why he is the number one bull rider in the world. That score of 93.5 points became the highest-combined score of Bones' career.In February 2009, stock contractor Chad Berger made it known in an interview that he reached his fill of hearing from Teague and others how great Bones is. Berger owned a rival bull named Big Tex, who he considered better than Bones. The then-current Stock Contractor of the Year challenged Teague to a contest for $25,000. Teague countered for $50,000 and Berger accepted. The match-up pitted the two bulls in the championship round of the Enterprise Rent-a-Car Invitational. World champion cowboy Ty Murray attested that they were both great bulls, and the outcome might depend on which bull rider drew which bull. The round took place in the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri, on Sunday, March 1, 2009. NBCSN's program Versus broadcast it in prime time. It was the first time the PBR sponsored a contest like this. No other bull vs bull challenge earned an owner such a large sum of money before. Zack Brown drew Big Tex, and 2004 World Champion Mike Lee drew Bones. Both men bucked off. It was an extremely close match, with Big Tex narrowly winning with a bull score of 46 to Bones' 45.5, giving Berger some relief. Berger received more relief later that year when a bull he owned an interest in, Code Blue, won that year's World Champion Bull title.\n\n2010 title\nPBR Livestock Director Cody Lambert believed that Bones was matched up with the best riders, and he proved he was their equal or better. Due to his bull scores, athleticism, and buck off percentages, he distinguished himself from the other bulls. In the 2010 PBR World Finals, Lambert did not hesitate to praise Bones when the bull won the World Champion Bull title again, this time against the favorite, Bushwacker. According to Lambert, it was surprising Bones won, but it was not a complete upset.At the finals, Bones first bucked off Mauney, who had ridden him back in 2009. Mauney only lasted four seconds. Bones was given a 45.25 bull score. Some argued his score was slightly lower due to the judges foreseeing a qualified ride from Mauney. Marchi, who was up next, tied his hand down too far, according to fellow bull rider J.W. Hart. This prevented Marchi from keeping up with Bones' change of direction; Bones bucked him off easily in two seconds, and was scored 47.25 which won him the World Champion Bull title. McBride felt winning two titles under different circumstances was impressive: the first time because he was an unknown, and the second time because other he was an underdog due to other bulls like Bushwacker who were favored to win.\n\nSummary\nBones bucked on the PBR tour a total of 45 times. He was ridden for a qualified ride only five times, giving him an 88.89% buckoff percentage at all levels. Bones bucked on the BFTS 34 times. Of those, he was ridden for a qualified ride four times, for an 88.24% buckoff percentage in the BFTS. Bones ranked 14th overall in the BFTS as of April 2017 according to Probullstats. Out of his four years on the BFTS, he qualified for the PBR World Finals three times. His average bull score was 45.56 points for all four years. Most do not take his first year on the BFTS seriously, since he only bucked one time that year, which was 2007. He had three scores over 90 points. On February 18, 2009, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Mauney rode him for 93.50 points. On October 30, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the PBR World Finals, Pete Farley rode him for 93.25 points. And, on January 8, 2010, at Madison Square Garden, in New York City, Shane Proctor rode him for 91.25 points. Scores of 90 or higher points are tracked in the PBR's 90 Point Club. Mauney's ride did not count because it was a special match staged to top off the event, and not part of the BFTS circuit.Bones was active from 2006 until 2010 at all levels. He won the World Champion Bull title in 2008 and 2010. He also won the Bull of the World Finals title both those same years. He, Dillinger, and Smooth Operator are the only two-time World Champion Bull title winners; Bones was the first bull to win multiple World Champion Bull titles in non-consecutive years. Only three other bulls won the title three times: Bushwacker, Little Yellow Jacket, and Bruiser. Their performances and the number of titles won is part of the reason these bulls (except Smooth Operator and Bruiser) were each selected to receive the Professional Bull Riders Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor. This honor was inaugurated in 2011 and first given to Little Yellow Jacket. Bones was the 2014 inductee.\n\nRetirement and legacy\nTeague retired Bones after the 2010 BFTS season when he was 7 years old. He announced it at the beginning of the 2011 BFTS season. Bones was still in the peak of his career at the time. Four years later, in 2014, the PBR announced that they were honoring Bones with the Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor. Bones was the fourth recipient to receive the Brand of Honor. The PBR created the Brand of Honor in 2011 to honor exemplary bulls in the sport. The ceremony usually takes place during the PBR World Finals, currently held at T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip. Lambert was not surprised Bones received the Brand of Honor. He felt that Bones was one of the finest bulls ever to compete in the PBR. Lambert also felt the honor was appropriate because otherwise it is difficult for people to recall great bulls once they are not around. He compared Bones to bulls like Bushwacker, Voodoo Child, and even famous bulls of the past such as Mr. T and 105 of Dell's Hall.As far as retiring Bones if he won the 2010 title, Teague said he had made up his mind to do it. McBride and Lambert both believed Teague wanted to see Bones go out while he was still on top. Teague also didn't want to chance Bones getting injured after he had already got two titles. Teague said, \"What more can you ask for out of a bull? I couldn't be happier with him.\" Some think Bones could have matched Little Yellow Jacket's three title record. Teague has stated that he is happy with the way things ended. Bones is retired at Teague's ranch in Graham, North Carolina.Two months before the PBR World Finals in 2014, McBride said Bones was one of the most gifted bulls he had been on, and was even harder to ride than World Champion Mossy Oak Mudslinger. At the time, Little Yellow Jacket was the solo holder of three World Champion titles, but McBride believed that Bones was more difficult to ride than Little Yellow Jacket. He compared Bones to other bulls that could yank a rider down to make them lose their seat like Rampage and Hollywood. Hearing of Bones receiving the Brand of Honor was no surprise to McBride, as he considered him one of the greats. That year, Bushwacker would win his third World Champion Bull title, and Lambert compared Bones to Bushwacker at the same stage of their bucking careers, noting that Bushwacker and Bones had a similar physicality and demeanor. \"[Bones] excelled in all five categories: buck, kick, direction change, intensity and degree of difficulty.\" He could get his front feet 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) in the air and then break over. He had a sense for knowing who was on his back. He performed at his best with the toughest riders. Lambert added that Bones was perhaps the second-best bull the PBR has seen. It is widely established that the PBR regards Bushwacker as the best bull they have ever seen.\n\nHonors\n2008 PBR World Champion Bull\n2008 PBR Bull of the World Finals\n2010 PBR World Champion Bull\n2010 PBR Bull of the World Finals\n2014 PBR Brand of Honor\nPassage 3:\nColin Fleming (racing driver)\nColin Fleming (born April 27, 1984) is an American former racing driver & Formula 1 test driver who competed in the World Series by Renault 3.5, Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup, and Formula Renault 2000 Germany with Jenzer Motorsport and Carlin Motorsport after a successful go-karting career, winning 10 North American and National Championships.\n\nRacing career\nA former member from the Red Bull Junior Team, Fleming finished 3rd in the Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup in 2004 and was rookie of the year in the Formula Renault 2000 Germany also in that year.

Balarama was a bull born about 1958 and was accompanied in the procession by other Dasara Elephants. Of the many (about 16) elephants participating, Balarama was one of the star attractions when he carried on his back the sacred idol of goddess Chamundeshwari in the 750 kilograms (1,650 lb) golden howdah on the auspicious 10th day of Dasara celebrations.\n\nHistory\nBalarama was captured in 1987 in the Kattepura forest near Somwarpet, in the Kodagu region of Karnataka. Balarama has taken part in the Dasara procession since 1994, carrying the golden howdah. A very silent bull (against the norm for elephants), he was said to be an introvert, and had to have special training so he could withstand the firing of cannons that occurs during the festival.He succeeded Drona as the carrier of the Golden Howdah.\nBalarama was not the first choice to carry the Howdah after Drona. Elephant Arjuna, a 44-year-old bull weighing 5,600 kilograms (12,300 lb) was supposed to be the carrier of the howdah, but was sidelined for accidentally killing a Mahout. One day, Arjuna went to bathe in a river with elephant Bahadur and Bahadur's trainer Annayya. While crossing a road, the elephants were startled by a vehicle and in the chaos that ensued, the rider Annayya fell down to the ground, only to be stamped on the head by Arjuna. He was crushed to death. People opined that an elephant that had killed a man was unfit to carry the religious duties of Dasara. So Arjuna, while being as capable as Drona, was not given the honorable duty, though he did have the honour of carrying the Chinnada Ambari once before being replaced by Balarama. Balarama had been rested from the duty of carrying the Golden Howdah due to his reducing weight and has been succeeded by Arjuna. Balarama led the procession as the 'nishane aane' or the lead elephant.\nBalarama's Mahout Sannappa once refused to mount Balarama after his family were stopped by the police from watching him ride during Dasara.\nBalarama refused food given to him by anybody other than his Mahout. Balarama weighed about 4590 Kilograms and he conquered the hearts of human beings by his majestic looks and the silence that he possessed. He was looked after at the Morkal Elephant camp at Nagarahole national park and his previous mahout Sannappa has retired and his new master Thimma has taken over.\nThe 67-year-old elephant was critically ill and under the care of a veterinarians at the Bhimanakatte elephant camp in the Hunsur range of the Nagarhole park. Despite the efforts of the medical team, Balarama\u2019s condition deteriorated. According to reports, Balarama had been recovering from an ulcer in his mouth but the veterinarian treating him suspected that he may have been suffering from tuberculosis. He died on 7 May 2023.\n\nSee also\nList of individual elephants\nPassage 7:\nJustin Tranchita\nJustin Chase Tranchita  (born June 22, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, and businessman. Born in Geneva, Illinois and raised in Princeton, Illinois. He achieved popularity by his recurring role on Game of Pawns and his music.\n\nLife and career\nEarly life and career beginning\nJustin was born to Joseph James Tranchita and Julee Ann Child in Geneva, Illinois, on June 22, 1981. His paternal grandfather was an immigrant from Marsala, Italy, while his mother was of Jewish and Irish ancestry. He has four elder siblings, Joe (born 1971), Julie (born 1974), Pam (born 1976) and Angie (born 1978) and four younger siblings, Jonathan (born 1983), Elliott (born 1990), Joshua (born 1995) and Marie (born 2000).\nHe was raised in Princeton, Illinois just past the Red Covered bridge on a farm with animals surrounded by corn fields. He attended Princeton High school and played football for the school but due to his parents religious beliefs he was pulled out of attendance and home schooled after his sophomore year. Tranchita went on several humanitarian trips as a boy taking him all over America and twice to Israel. After his parents divorced his senior year in high school Tranchita had a crisis of faith and left Princeton. He later told the Bureau County Republican that \"It was kind of a long road out of Princeton but it was the best place a kid could grow up. \" Justin received a music scholarship to Greenville College and attended in 1999. In 2000 he dropped out of college and relocated to Branson , Missouri where he met Don Williams brother of American singer Andy Williams and Robert Vinton son of American singer Bobby Vinton  who helped Justin take the leap into a career in music and television.\n\nTelevision and music\nTranchita starred on the television series Game of Pawns which airs on the Discovery Channel globally. The series was filmed in 2013 by High Noon Entertainment and is based on the goings on in a pawn shop in Branson, Missouri. Justin is joined by Scott Velvet and Brian Roman in this television game show which continues to run as re-runs in the United States and around the world on Discovery networks.Recorded with producer and writer Steve Messer, the song \"This is America\" features lyrics about American politics. It first became noticed when the Ben Carson presidential campaign heard the song and decided to use it as their campaign song for 2016. Quickly after Ben Carson used the song it had commercial success by reaching number one on the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artist chart on November 28th, 2015 where it continued to stay on the chart for weeks. The song was controversial in nature and garnered mixed reviews, digg.com said it was \"one of the worste campaign songs of all time.\" Dan Fallon of digg.com wrote \"Props to Tranchita for almost getting the lyric \"While governmental power tends to grow continuously\" to not sound super awkward.\" Tranchita told The Guardian, \"When I started to look into Ben Carson and what he stood for...people who have a faith \u2013 I identify with them because it does separate from people who do not.\u201d Ben Carson personally thanked Justin for allowing him to use the song publicly in a statement to his Facebook followers, This is America returned to the number one spot again in 2016 after spending ten weeks on Billboards Emerging chart. This gave Tranchita a number one hit with the same song in two different years.\n\nDiscography\nThe Devil Song, (single)  (2012)\nCock of The Walk (2012)\nThis is America (single) (2015)\nAmerican Man 2016\n\nMichigan State House Run\nAfter the song \"This is America\" vaulted Tranchita into the political limelight he decided to run for the Michigan State House, district 32 in March of 2016. He was among Macomb County Republicans competing in state House races. Tranchita said the popularity of his song was responsible in part for his run, he told The Detroit News, \"Millions of people have responded to [the song]... There's some angst, some anger, and people are feeling like their voices aren't heard. I feel that. I'm a blue-collar guy, not some elitist or crony that wants to be in the ruling class.\" After a very hard fought race Tranchita was narrowly defeated in his first ever political campaign by six percent in the August 2016 primary.\nPassage 8:\nCock and Bull (book)\nCock and Bull is the title of a volume composed of two novellas by Will Self, which includes the stories Cock and Bull. The two stories are characterized by empty, emotionless, phatic sex; rape; cruelty; and violence. The book was originally published in 1992 by Bloomsbury.\n\nPlot summaries\nCock\nA woman grows a penis and then uses it to rape her tedious, alcoholic husband and his patronising, evangelical mentor from Alcoholics Anonymous. In the story's final twist, the woman comes into non-consensual contact with her violating member, and makes allusions to The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\n\nBull\nA sensitive rugby player-cum-writer for a small magazine grows a vagina behind his knee. His megalomaniacal general practitioner, having discovered the vagina during an examination, conceals it from Bull, telling him it was 'a burn and a wound', though later visits Bull at home, fixated on this popliteal yoni. The doctor, removing the bandages from the site, reveals the truth, and seduces Bull while he is traumatised and huddled beneath the sink.\nGender stereotypes are examined; much fun is made of modern literary criticism and its often clich\u00e9d takes on the gender debate.\n\nReviews\n\"In recounting such events, Mr. Self demonstrates an uncanny ability, similar to that displayed by Kafka in The Metamorphosis, to lend utterly absurd events an aura of verisimilitude by grounding the fantastic in the mundane. He possesses all those gifts a satiric writer might want: an eye for the telling detail, an ear for the pretensions of contemporary locution, an ability to write idiosyncratic prose that twinkles with cleverness and wit. Unfortunately, in this volume, these copious gifts are all too frequently put in the service of a misogynistic and ridiculously sophomoric vision. \" Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times\nPassage 9:\nWill Self\nWilliam Woodard Self (born 26 September 1961) is an English author, journalist, political commentator and broadcaster. He has written 11 novels, five collections of shorter fiction, three novellas and nine collections of non-fiction writing. Self is currently Professor of Modern Thought at Brunel University London, where he teaches psychogeography.His 2002 novel Dorian, an Imitation was longlisted for the Booker Prize, and his 2012 novel Umbrella was shortlisted. His fiction is known for being satirical, grotesque and fantastical, and is predominantly set within his home city of London. His writing often explores mental illness, drug abuse and psychiatry.\nSelf is a regular contributor to publications including The Guardian, Harper's Magazine, The New York Times and the London Review of Books. He currently writes a column for the New Statesman, and he has been a columnist for the Observer, The Times, and the Evening Standard. His columns for Building Design on the built environment, and for the Independent Magazine on the psychology of place brought him to prominence as a thinker concerned with the politics of urbanism.\nSelf is a regular contributor to British television, initially as a guest on comic panel shows such as Have I Got News for You. In 2002, Self replaced Mark Lamarr on the BBC comedy panel show Shooting Stars  for two series, but was himself replaced by comedian Jack Dee when the programme returned in 2008.  He has since appeared on current affairs programmes such as Newsnight and Question Time. Self is a contributor to the BBC Radio 4 programme A Point of View, to which he contributes radio essays delivered in his familiar \"lugubrious tones\". In 2013, Self took part in discussions about becoming the inaugural BBC Radio 4 Writer-in-Residence, but later withdrew.\n\nEarly life\nSelf was born in Charing Cross Hospital and brought up in North London, between the suburbs of East Finchley and Hampstead Garden Suburb. His parents were Peter John Otter Self, Professor of Public Administration at the London School of Economics, and Elaine Rosenbloom, from Queens, New York, who worked as a publisher's assistant. His paternal grandfather was Sir Albert Henry Self. Self spent a year living in Ithaca in upstate New York.Self's parents separated when he was nine, and divorced when he was 18. Despite the intellectual encouragement given by his parents, he was an emotionally confused and self-destructive child, harming himself with cigarette ends and knives before beginning to experiment with drugs.Self was a voracious reader from a young age. When he was 10, he developed an interest in works of science fiction such as Frank Herbert's Dune and the works of J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick. Into his teenage years, Self claimed to have been \"overawed by the canon\", which stifled his ability to express himself. Self's use of drugs increased in step with his prolific reading. He started smoking cannabis at the age of 12, progressing by way of amphetamines, cocaine and LSD to heroin, which he started injecting at 18. Self struggled with mental health issues during this period, and aged 20 became a hospital outpatient.Self attended University College School, an independent school for boys in Hampstead. He later attended Christ's College, Finchley, from where he went to Exeter College, Oxford, reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics and graduated with a third class degree. At Oxford, he was editor of and frequent contributor to an underground left-wing student newspaper called Red Herring\/Oxford Strumpet, copies of which are archived in the Bodleian Library.\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating from Oxford, Self worked for the Greater London Council, including as a road sweeper, while residing in Brixton. He pursued a career as a cartoonist for the New Statesman and other publications and as a stand-up comedian. He moved to Gloucester Road around 1985. In 1986 he entered a treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare, where he claimed that his heroin addiction was cured. In 1989, \"through a series of accidents\", he \"blagged\" his way into running a small publishing company.The publication of his short story collection The Quantity Theory of Insanity brought him to public attention in 1991. Self was hailed as an original new talent by Salman Rushdie, Doris Lessing, Beryl Bainbridge, A. S. Byatt and Bill Buford. In 1993, he was nominated by Granta magazine as one of the 20 \"Best Young British Novelists\". Conversely, Self's second book, My Idea of Fun, was \"mauled\" by the critics.Self joined the Observer as a columnist in 1995. He gained negative publicity in 1997 when he was sent to cover the election campaign of John Major and was caught by a rival journalist using heroin on the Prime Minister's jet; he was fired as a result. At the time, he argued \"I'm a hack who gets hired because I do drugs\". He joined the Times as a columnist in 1997. In 1999 he left the Times to join the Independent on Sunday, which he left in 2002 for the Evening Standard.He has made many appearances on British television, especially as a panellist on Have I Got News for You and as a regular on Shooting Stars. Since 2008 Self has appeared five times on Question Time. He stopped appearing in Have I Got News for You, stating the show had become a pseudo-panel show. Between 2003 and 2006, he was a regular contributor to the BBC2 television series Grumpy Old Men.Since 2009, Self has written two alternating fortnightly columns for the New Statesman. The Madness of Crowds explores social phenomena and group behaviour, and in Real Meals he reviews high street food outlets. For a May 2014 article in The Guardian, he wrote: \"the literary novel as an art work and a narrative art form central to our culture is indeed dying before our eyes\", explaining in a July 2014 article that his royalty income had decreased \"dramatically\" over the previous decade. The July article followed the release of a study of the earnings of British authors that was commissioned by the Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society.Self is a professor of Modern Thought at Brunel University London. He was appointed in 2012.\n\nLiterary style\nAccording to M. Hunter Hayes, Self has given his reason for writing as follows: \"I don't write fiction for people to identify with and I don't write a picture of the world they can recognise. I write to astonish people.\" \"What excites me is to disturb the reader's fundamental assumptions. I want to make them feel that certain categories within which they are used to perceiving the world are unstable.\"When he was ten, he developed an interest in works of science fiction such as Frank Herbert's Dune and those of J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick. Self admires the work of J. G. Ballard, Alasdair Gray and Martin Amis. He has said that he previously admired William Burroughs but went off him. He has cited influences such as Jonathan Swift, Franz Kafka, Lewis Carroll and Joseph Heller as formative influences on his writing style. Other influences on his fiction include Hunter S. Thompson. Self credits C\u00e9line's book Journey to the End of the Night with inspiring him to write fiction.Zack Busner is a recurring character in Self's fiction, appearing in the short story collections The Quantity Theory of Insanity, Grey Area and Dr. Mukti and Other Tales of Woe, as well as in the novels Great Apes, The Book of Dave, Umbrella and Shark. Busner is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst practising in London, and is prone to self-promotion at the expense of his patients. He is often the antagonist of the stories he appears in, although not always with villainous intent.\nAmong Self's admirers was the American critic Harold Bloom. Journalist Stuart Maconie has described him as \"that rarity in modern cultural life, a genuine intellectual with a bracing command of words and ideas who is also droll, likeable and culturally savvy.\"\n\nPolitical views\nIn the 2015 UK general election Self voted Labour in a general election for the first time since 1997. In May 2015, he wrote in The Guardian: \"No, I'm no longer a socialist if to be one is to believe that a socialist utopia is attainable by some collective feat of will \u2013 but I remain a socialist, if 'socialism' is to be understood as an antipathy to vested interests and privileges neither deserved nor earned, and a strong desire for a genuinely egalitarian society.\" In March 2017, he wrote in the New Statesman: \"Nowadays I think in terms of compassionate pragmatism: I'll leave socialism to \u017di\u017eek and the other bloviators.\"In July 2015 Self endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said during a Channel 4 News interview that Corbyn represents a useful ideological divide within Labour, and could lead to the formation of a schism in the party.Self is a republican.\n\nPersonal life\nSelf's mother died in 1988. He was married from 1989 to 1997 to Kate Chancellor. They have two children, a son, Alexis, and a daughter, Madeleine. They lived together in a terraced house just off the Portobello Road. In 1997, Self married journalist Deborah Orr, with whom he has sons Ivan and Luther. In 2017, Orr and Self separated, and Self was living in a rented flat in Stockwell. Orr died on 20 October 2019.\nSelf has stated that he has abstained from drugs, except for caffeine and nicotine, since 1998. He sent his younger children to private schools after they experienced bullying at state schools in Lambeth.Self was diagnosed with the blood disease Polycythaemia vera in 2011.He has described himself as a psychogeographer and modern fl\u00e2neur, and has written about walks he has taken. In December 2006, he walked 26 miles (42 kilometres) from his home in South London to Heathrow Airport. Upon arriving at Kennedy Airport he walked 20 miles (32 kilometres) from there to Manhattan. In August 2013, Self wrote of his anger following an incident in which he was stopped and questioned by police in Yorkshire while out walking with his 11-year-old son, on suspicion of being a paedophile. The police were alerted by a security guard at Bishop Burton College. He had asked the security guard for permission to cross the school grounds.In September 2018 Self was accused of \"mental cruelty\" by Orr in relation to their divorce, in a series of posts on Twitter.Self has discussed his Jewish heritage and its impact on his identity. In 2006, Self  'resigned' as a Jew as a protest against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. In 2018 he stated in an interview with the BBC that he had rethought his position, due to the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Britain.Self is 6 feet 5 inches (196 cm) tall, collects vintage typewriters and smokes a pipe. His brother is the author and journalist Jonathan Self.Self became a vegetarian in 2019.\n\nLegacy\nIn 2016, the British Library acquired Self's archive; the collection is a hybrid archive of paper and born-digital material. The Papers of Will Self are divided into two parts: family papers and personal and literary papers. The papers can be accessed through the British Library catalogue.\n\nAwards\n1991: Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for The Quantity Theory of Insanity\n1998: Aga Khan Prize for Fiction from The Paris Review for Tough Tough Toys for Tough Tough Boys\n2008: Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction for The Butt\n\nWorks\nNovels\nCock and Bull (1992)\nMy Idea of Fun (1993)\nThe Sweet Smell of Psychosis (illustrated novella) (1996)\nGreat Apes (1997)\nHow the Dead Live (2000)\nDorian, an Imitation (2002)\nThe Book of Dave (2006)\nThe Butt (2008)\nWalking to Hollywood (2010)\nUmbrella (2012)\nShark (2014)\nPhone (2017)\n\nShort story collections\nThe Quantity Theory of Insanity (1991)\nGrey Area (1994)\nTough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys (1998)\nDr. Mukti and Other Tales of Woe (2004)\nLiver: A Fictional Organ with a Surface Anatomy of Four Lobes (2008)\nThe Undivided Self: Selected Stories (2010)\n\nNon-fiction\nSelf has also compiled several books of work from his newspaper and magazine columns which mix interviews with counter-culture figures, restaurant reviews and literary criticism.\n\nJunk Mail (1996)\nPerfidious Man (2000) photography by David M.

He was the 2008 PBR World Champion.\n\nBackground\nMarchi is 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m) tall and weighs 198 pounds (90 kg). He is from Leme, S\u00e3o Paulo, and is of Italian descent on his father's side. He rode his bulls right-handed. His special interests include soccer, team roping, and surfing.\n\nCareer\nMarchi competed very briefly in the Championship Bull Riding (CBR) tour in 2004 before joining the PBR full-time. He debuted late in the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) season that year, qualifying for his first-ever PBR World Finals and finishing 41st in the world. After finishing in the runner-up position for the PBR World Championship in three consecutive years, he won his world title in 2008. Statistically, Marchi was one of the most consistent riders on the tour. He would go on to qualify for the World Finals all 15 years of his PBR career (2004 to 2018).In 2005, Guilherme Marchi was the biggest threat to Justin McBride\u2019s dream of being the PBR World Champion. McBride won, Marchi came in second. However, Marchi was the PBR World Finals event champion that year. \nIn 2006, during one of the last few regular-season BFTS events before the World Finals, Marchi won $90,000 by successfully riding Scene of the Crash in the Mossy Oak Shootout in Greensboro, North Carolina. At the World Finals, Marchi once again failed to win when fellow Brazilian Adriano Moraes came from behind to claim the PBR world championship, with Marchi placing second. \nYet again, in 2007, Marchi finished the season in the number two position behind Justin McBride at the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas.In 2008, Marchi dominated the PBR circuit, riding nearly 75% of his bulls, winning five events, and earning over $1.5 million (nearly three times as much as any other PBR rider) on his way to his PBR world championship title and the $1 million bonus that went with it.In March 2014, in the opening round of the BFTS event in Phoenix, Arizona, Marchi became the first bull rider to successfully complete 500 qualified rides in the PBR, riding Pandora\u2019s Pyxis.On April 8, 2017, Marchi rode Shocker for 86.25 points in Round 2 of the BFTS event in Billings, Montana. In doing so, he became the first PBR rider to reach 600 qualified rides and received a commemorative belt buckle.On August 12, 2018, Marchi announced that 2018 would be his final year of bull riding, with the intention of retiring after the PBR World Finals. He finished his professional career with 635 qualified rides (the most ever in PBR history), 36 PBR event wins, and over $5.3 million in career earnings.Marchi officially retired from bull riding following his victory at the 2018 PBR Brazil event in Goi\u00e2nia, Goi\u00e1s.In 2023, Marchi became the assistant coach to head coach J.W. Hart of the Kansas City Outlaws; one of eight bull riding teams of the PBR\u2019s Team Series, which debuted the previous year and holds events in the United States from the summer through autumn. Marchi will also work on the team\u2019s recruiting and development efforts for riders in Brazil.\n\nHonors\nOn November 5, 2019, Marchi was inducted into the PBR Ring of Honor.On May 14, 2022, Marchi was inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame.\n\nPersonal\nOn April 19, 2018, Marchi married long-time girlfriend Maria in Texas. She is his second wife. They have a son. Marchi also has two other children, a daughter and son, from his first wife, Patricia. All of his children were born in the United States. While competing in the U.S. PBR circuit, Marchi lived in Ferris, Texas. After retiring from bull riding, he moved back to Brazil with his family.","label":"longbench","length":11336,"title":"Passage 1:"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nBlack Death\nThe Black Death (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality or the Plague) was a bubonic plague pandemic occurring in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1346 to 1353. It is the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, causing the deaths of 75\u2013200 million people, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis spread by fleas, but during the Black Death it probably also took a secondary form, spread by person-to-person contact via aerosols, causing pneumonic plague.The Black Death was the beginning of the second plague pandemic. The plague created religious, social and economic upheavals, with profound effects on the course of European history.\nThe origin of the Black Death is disputed. Genetic analysis points to the evolution of Yersinia pestis in the Tian Shan mountains on the border between Kyrgyzstan and China 2,600 years ago. The immediate territorial origins of the Black Death and its outbreak remains unclear with some pointing towards Central Asia, China, the Middle East and Europe. The pandemic was reportedly first introduced to Europe during the siege of the Genoese trading port of Kaffa in Crimea by the Golden Horde army of Jani Beg in 1347. From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, Western Asia and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily and the Italian Peninsula. There is evidence that once it came ashore, the Black Death mainly spread person-to-person as pneumonic plague, thus explaining the quick inland spread of the epidemic, which was faster than would be expected if the primary vector was rat fleas causing bubonic plague. In 2022, it was discovered that there was a sudden surge of deaths in what is today Kyrgyzstan from the Black Death in the late 1330s; when combined with genetic evidence, this implies that the initial spread may not have been due to Mongol conquests in the 14th century, as previously speculated.The Black Death was the second great natural disaster to strike Europe during the Late Middle Ages (the first one being the Great Famine of 1315\u20131317) and is estimated to have killed 30 percent to 60 percent of the European population, as well as about one-third of the population of the Middle East. The plague might have reduced the world population from c.\u2009475 million to 350\u2013375 million in the 14th century. There were further outbreaks throughout the Late Middle Ages and, with other contributing factors (the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages), the European population did not regain its level in 1300 until 1500. Outbreaks of the plague recurred around the world until the early 19th century.\n\nNames\nEuropean writers contemporary with the plague described the disease in Latin as pestis or pestilentia, 'pestilence'; epidemia, 'epidemic'; mortalitas, 'mortality'. In English prior to the 18th century, the event was called the \"pestilence\" or \"great pestilence\", \"the plague\" or the \"great death\". Subsequent to the pandemic \"the furste moreyn\" (first murrain) or \"first pestilence\" was applied, to distinguish the mid-14th century phenomenon from other infectious diseases and epidemics of plague.The 1347 pandemic plague was not referred to specifically as \"black\" in the time of occurrence in any European language, though the expression \"black death\" had occasionally been applied to fatal disease beforehand. \"Black death\" was not used to describe the plague pandemic in English until the 1750s; the term is first attested in 1755, where it translated Danish: den sorte d\u00f8d, lit.\u2009'the black death'. This expression as a proper name for the pandemic had been popularized by Swedish and Danish chroniclers in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and in the 16th and 17th centuries was transferred to other languages as a calque: Icelandic: svarti dau\u00f0i, German: der schwarze Tod, and French: la mort noire. Previously, most European languages had named the pandemic a variant or calque of the Latin: magna mortalitas, lit.\u2009'Great Death'.The phrase 'black death' \u2013 describing Death as black \u2013 is very old. Homer used it in the Odyssey to describe the monstrous Scylla, with her mouths \"full of black Death\" (Ancient Greek: \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf, romanized: ple\u00eeoi m\u00e9lanos Than\u00e1toio). Seneca the Younger may have been the first to describe an epidemic as 'black death', (Latin: mors atra) but only in reference to the acute lethality and dark prognosis of disease. The 12th\u201313th century French physician Gilles de Corbeil had already used atra mors to refer to a \"pestilential fever\" (febris pestilentialis) in his work On the Signs and Symptoms of Diseases (De signis et symptomatibus aegritudium). The phrase mors nigra, 'black death', was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino (or Couvin), a Belgian astronomer, in his poem \"On the Judgement of the Sun at a Feast of Saturn\" (De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni), which attributes the plague to an astrological conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. His use of the phrase is not connected unambiguously with the plague pandemic of 1347 and appears to refer to the fatal outcome of disease.The historian Cardinal Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893 and suggested that it had been \"some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\". In 1908, Gasquet said use of the name atra mors for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in a 1631 book on Danish history by J. I. Pontanus: \"Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death\" (Vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocitabant).\n\nPrevious plague epidemics\nResearch from 2017 suggests plague first infected humans in Europe and Asia in the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age. Research in 2018 found evidence of Yersinia pestis in an ancient Swedish tomb, which may have been associated with the \"Neolithic decline\" around 3000 BCE, in which European populations fell significantly. This Y. pestis may have been different from more modern types, with bubonic plague transmissible by fleas first known from Bronze Age remains near Samara.The symptoms of bubonic plague are first attested in a fragment of Rufus of Ephesus preserved by Oribasius; these ancient medical authorities suggest bubonic plague had appeared in the Roman Empire before the reign of Trajan, six centuries before arriving at Pelusium in the reign of Justinian I. In 2013, researchers confirmed earlier speculation that the cause of the Plague of Justinian (541\u2013542 CE, with recurrences until 750) was Y. pestis. This is known as the first plague pandemic. In 610, the Chinese physician Chao Yuanfang described a \"malignant bubo\" \"coming in abruptly with high fever together with the appearance of a bundle of nodes beneath the tissue.\" The Chinese physician Sun Simo who died in 652 also mentioned a \"malignant bubo\" and plague that was common in Lingnan (Guangzhou). Ole J\u00f8rgen Benedictow believes that this indicates it was an offshoot of the first plague pandemic which made its way eastward to Chinese territory by around 600.\n\n14th-century plague\nCauses\nEarly theory\nThe most authoritative contemporary account is found in a report from the medical faculty in Paris to Philip VI of France. It blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a \"great pestilence in the air\" (miasma theory). Muslim religious scholars taught that the pandemic was a \"martyrdom and mercy\" from God, assuring the believer's place in paradise. For non-believers, it was a punishment. Some Muslim doctors cautioned against trying to prevent or treat a disease sent by God. Others adopted preventive measures and treatments for plague used by Europeans. These Muslim doctors also depended on the writings of the ancient Greeks.\n\nPredominant modern theory\nDue to climate change in Asia, rodents began to flee the dried-out grasslands to more populated areas, spreading the disease. The plague disease, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas, including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, North India, Uganda and the western United States.Y. pestis was discovered by Alexandre Yersin, a pupil of Louis Pasteur, during an epidemic of bubonic plague in Hong Kong in 1894; Yersin also proved this bacillus was present in rodents and suggested the rat was the main vehicle of transmission. The mechanism by which Y. pestis is usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage starves the fleas and drives them to aggressive feeding behaviour and attempts to clear the blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lacks resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.\n\nDNA evidence\nDefinitive confirmation of the role of Y. pestis arrived in 2010 with a publication in PLOS Pathogens by Haensch et al. They assessed the presence of DNA\/RNA with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for Y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, \"ends the debate about the cause of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\". In 2011, these results were further confirmed with genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England. Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 \"that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y. pestis that may no longer exist\".Later in 2011, Bos et al. reported in Nature the first draft genome of Y. pestis from plague victims from the same East Smithfield cemetery and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of Y. pestis.Since this time, further genomic papers have further confirmed the phylogenetic placement of the Y. pestis strain responsible for the Black Death as both the ancestor of later plague epidemics including the third plague pandemic and as the descendant of the strain responsible for the Plague of Justinian. In addition, plague genomes from significantly earlier in prehistory have been recovered.DNA taken from 25 skeletons from 14th century London have shown plague is a strain of Y. pestis almost identical to that which hit Madagascar in 2013. Further DNA evidence also proves the role of Y. Pestis and traces the source to the Tian Shan Mountains in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nAlternative explanations\nIt is recognised that an epidemiological account of plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the disease in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken in England between the time of publication of the Domesday Book of 1086 and the poll tax of the year 1377. Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures for the clergy.\nMathematical modelling is used to match the spreading patterns and the means of transmission. A research in 2018 challenged the popular hypothesis that \"infected rats died, their flea parasites could have jumped from the recently dead rat hosts to humans\". It suggested an alternative model in which \"the disease was spread from human fleas and body lice to other people\". The second model claims to better fit the trends of death toll because the rat-flea-human hypothesis would have produced a delayed but very high spike in deaths, which contradict historical death data.Lars Wall\u00f8e complains that all of these authors \"take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat \u2192 rat flea \u2192 human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of Yersinia pestis infection could spread\", whilst pointing to several other possibilities. Similarly, Monica Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-commensal) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of numerous rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the disease spread too quickly to support the thesis that Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. This theory is supported by research in 2018 which suggested transmission was more likely by body lice and fleas during the second plague pandemic.\n\nSummary\nAlthough academic debate continues, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicaemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed in the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis. Currently, while osteoarcheologists have conclusively verified the presence of Y. pestis bacteria in burial sites across northern Europe through examination of bones and dental pulp, no other epidemic pathogen has been discovered to bolster the alternative explanations.\n\nTransmission\nLack of hygiene\nThe importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century with the development of the germ theory of disease; until then streets were commonly filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding, facilitating the spread of transmissible disease.By the early fourteenth century so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by merde, the French word for \"shit\". There were rue Merdeux, rue Merdelet, rue Merdusson, rue des Merdons and rue Merdiere\u2014as well as a rue du Pipi.Pigs, cattle, chickens, geese, goats and horses roamed the streets of medieval London and Paris. Medieval homeowners were supposed to police their housefronts, including removing animal dung, but most urbanites were as careless as William E. Cosner, a resident of the London suburb of Farringdon Without. A complaint lodged against Cosner charges that \"men could not pass [by his house] for the stink [of] . . . horse dung and horse piss.\"One irate Londoner complained that the runoff from the local slaughterhouse had made his garden \"stinking and putrid\", while another charged that the blood from slain animals flooded nearby streets and lanes, \"making a foul corruption and abominable sight to all dwelling near.\" In much of medieval Europe, sanitation legislation consisted of an ordinance requiring homeowners to shout, \"Look out below!\" three times before dumping a full chamber pot into the street.Early Christians, who thought self-abnegation a cardinal virtue, considered bathing, if not a vice, then a temptation. \"Who knows what impure thoughts might arise in a tub of warm water? With this danger in mind, St. Benedict declared, \"To those who are well, and especially to the young, bathing shall seldom be permitted.\" St. Agnes took the injunction to heart and died without ever bathing.\n\nTerritorial origins\nAccording to a team of medical geneticists led by Mark Achtman that analysed the genetic variation of the bacterium Yersinia pestis \"evolved in or near China\" over 2,600 years ago. Later research by a team led by Galina Eroshenko places the origins more specifically in the Tian Shan mountains on the border between Kyrgyzstan and China. However more recent research notes that the previous sampling had a very heavy East Asian bias and that sampling since then has discovered strains of Y. pestis in the Caucasus region that were previously thought to be restricted to China. There is also no physical or specific textual evidence of the Black Death in 14th century China. As a result, China's place in the sequence of the plague's spread is still debated to this day. According to Charles Creighton, records of epidemics in 14th century China suggest nothing more than typhus and major Chinese outbreaks of epidemic disease post-date the European epidemic by several years. The earliest Chinese descriptions of the bubonic plague do not appear until the 1640s.Nestorian graves dating to 1338\u20131339 near Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague, which has led some historians and epidemiologists to think they mark the outbreak of the epidemic; this is supported by recent direct findings of Y. pestis DNA in teeth samples from graves in the area with inscriptions referring to \"pestilence\" as the cause of death. Epidemics killed an estimated 25 million across Asia during the fifteen years before the Black Death reached Constantinople in 1347.\nThe evidence does not suggest, at least at present, that these mortality crises were caused by plague. Although some scholars, including McNeill and Cao, see the 1333 outbreak as a prelude to the outbreaks in Europe from the late 1340s to the early 1350s, scholars of the Yuan and Ming periods remain skeptical about such an interpretation. Nonetheless, the remarkably high mortality rates during the Datong mortality should discourage us from rejecting the possibility of localized\/regional outbreaks of plague in different parts of China, albeit differing in scale from, and unrelated to, the pandemic mortality of the Black Death. What we lack is any indication of a plague pandemic that engulfed vast territories of the Yuan Empire and later moved into western Eurasia through Central Asia.\nAccording to John Norris, evidence from Issyk-Kul indicates a small sporadic outbreak characteristic of transmission from rodents to humans with no wide-scale impact. According to Achtman, the dating of the plague suggests that it was not carried along the Silk Road, and its widespread appearance in that region probably postdates the European outbreak. There are no records of the symptoms of the Black Death from Mongol sources or writings from travelers east of the Black Sea prior to the Crimean outbreak in 1346. Finally, the Silk Road had already been heavily disrupted before the spread of the Black Death. Western and Middle Eastern traders found it difficult to trade on the Silk Road by 1325 and impossible by 1340, making spread of the plague less likely.Others still favor an origin in China or even Kurdistan, and not Central Asia. According to the theory of Chinese origin, the disease may have traveled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders, or it could have arrived via ship, but this theory is still contested. It is speculated that rats aboard Zheng He's ships in the 15th century may have carried the plague to Southeast Asia, India and Africa.\nResearch on the Delhi Sultanate and the Yuan Dynasty shows no evidence of any serious epidemic in fourteenth-century India and no specific evidence of plague in fourteenth-century China, suggesting that the Black Death may not have reached these regions. Ole Benedictow argues that since the first clear reports of the Black Death come from Kaffa, the Black Death most likely originated in the nearby plague focus on the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea.\nDemographic historians estimate that China's population fell by at least 15 percent, and perhaps as much as a third, between 1340 and 1370. This population loss coincided with the Black Death that ravaged Europe and much of the Islamic world in 1347\u201352. However, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence for pandemic disease on the scale of the Black Death in China at this time. War and famine \u2013 and the diseases that typically accompanied them \u2013 probably were the main causes of mortality in the final decades of Mongol rule.\nMonica H. Green suggests that the reason why other parts of Eurasia outside the west do not contain the same evidence of the Black Plague is because there were actually four strains of Yersinia pestis that became predominant in different parts of the world. Mongol records of illness such as food poisoning may have been referring to the Black Plague. Another theory is that the Black Death originated near Europe and cycled through the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and Russia before making its way to China. Other historians such as John Norris and Ole Benedictaw believe the Black Death likely originated in Europe or the Middle East and never reached China.\n\nEuropean outbreak\nPlague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders from their port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347. During a protracted siege of the city, in 1345\u20131346 the Mongol Golden Horde army of Jani Beg, whose mainly Tatar troops were suffering from the disease, catapulted infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants, though it is more likely that infected rats travelled across the siege lines to spread the epidemic to the inhabitants. As the disease took hold, Genoese traders fled across the Black Sea to Constantinople, where the disease first arrived in Europe in summer 1347.The epidemic there killed the 13-year-old son of the Byzantine emperor, John VI Kantakouzenos, who wrote a description of the disease modelled on Thucydides's account of the 5th century BCE Plague of Athens, but noting the spread of the Black Death by ship between maritime cities. Nicephorus Gregoras also described in writing to Demetrios Kydones the rising death toll, the futility of medicine, and the panic of the citizens. The first outbreak in Constantinople lasted a year, but the disease recurred ten times before 1400.Carried by twelve Genoese galleys, plague arrived by ship in Sicily in October 1347; the disease spread rapidly all over the island. Galleys from Kaffa reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in Marseilles.From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain (the epidemic began to wreak havoc first on the Crown of Aragon in the spring of 1348), Portugal and England by June 1348, then spread east and north through Germany, Scotland and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced into Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Ask\u00f8y, then spread to Bj\u00f8rgvin (modern Bergen) and Iceland. Finally, it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. Plague was somewhat more uncommon in parts of Europe with less developed trade with their neighbours, including the majority of the Basque Country, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated Alpine villages throughout the continent.According to some epidemiologists, periods of unfavourable weather decimated plague-infected rodent populations and forced their fleas onto alternative hosts, inducing plague outbreaks which often peaked in the hot summers of the Mediterranean, as well as during the cool autumn months of the southern Baltic region. Among many other culprits of plague contagiousness, malnutrition, even if distantly, also contributed to such an immense loss in European population, since it weakened immune systems.\n\nWestern Asian and North African outbreak\nThe disease struck various regions in the Middle East and North Africa during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As infected rodents infected new rodents, the disease spread across the region, entering also from southern Russia.\nBy autumn 1347, plague had reached Alexandria in Egypt, transmitted by sea from Constantinople; according to a contemporary witness, from a single merchant ship carrying slaves. By late summer 1348 it reached Cairo, capital of the Mamluk Sultanate, cultural centre of the Islamic world, and the largest city in the Mediterranean Basin; the Bahriyya child sultan an-Nasir Hasan fled and more than a third of the 600,000 residents died. The Nile was choked with corpses despite Cairo having a medieval hospital, the late 13th century bimaristan of the Qalawun complex. The historian al-Maqrizi described the abundant work for grave-diggers and practitioners of funeral rites, and plague recurred in Cairo more than fifty times over the following one and a half centuries.During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza by April; by July it had reached Damascus, and in October plague had broken out in Aleppo. That year, in the territory of modern Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Palestine, the cities of Ascalon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon and Homs were all infected. In 1348\u20131349, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, but most of them ended up dying during the journey. Within two years, the plague had spread throughout the Islamic world, from Arabia across North Africa. The pandemic spread westwards from Alexandria along the African coast, while in April 1348 Tunis was infected by ship from Sicily. Tunis was then under attack by an army from Morocco; this army dispersed in 1348 and brought the contagion with them to Morocco, whose epidemic may also have been seeded from the Islamic city of Almer\u00eda in al-Andalus.Mecca became infected in 1348 by pilgrims performing the Hajj. In 1351 or 1352, the Rasulid sultan of the Yemen, al-Mujahid Ali, was released from Mamluk captivity in Egypt and carried plague with him on his return home. During 1348, records show the city of Mosul suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease.\n\nSigns and symptoms\nBubonic plague\nSymptoms of the disease include fever of 38\u201341 \u00b0C (100\u2013106 \u00b0F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.Contemporary accounts of the pandemic are varied and often imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of buboes (or gavocciolos) in the groin, neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened. Boccaccio's description:\n\nIn men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg ... From the two said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.\nThis was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most people died two to seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes, which could have been caused by flea-bites, were identified as another potential sign of plague.\n\nPneumonic plague\nLodewijk Heyligen, whose master the Cardinal Colonna died of plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease, pneumonic plague, that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems. Symptoms include fever, cough and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent.\n\nSepticaemic plague\nSepticaemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicaemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.\n\nConsequences\nDeaths\nThere are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality. In urban centres, the greater the population before the outbreak, the longer the duration of the period of abnormal mortality. It killed some 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia. A study published in 2022 of pollen samples across Europe between 1250 and 1450 was used to estimate changes in agricultural output before and after the Black Death. The authors found great variability in different regions, with evidence for high mortality in areas of Scandinavia, France, western Germany, Greece and central Italy, but uninterrupted agricultural growth in central and eastern Europe, Iberia and Ireland.The mortality rate of the Black Death in the 14th century was far greater than the worst 20th-century outbreaks of Y. pestis plague, which occurred in India and killed as much as 3% of the population of certain cities. The overwhelming number of deceased bodies produced by the Black Death caused the necessity of mass burial sites in Europe, sometimes including up to several hundred or several thousand skeletons. The mass burial sites that have been excavated have allowed archaeologists to continue interpreting and defining the biological, sociological, historical and anthropological implications of the Black Death.According to medieval historian Philip Daileader, it is likely that over four years, 45\u201350% of the European population died of plague. Norwegian historian Ole Benedictow suggests it could have been as much as 60% of the European population. In 1348, the disease spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. Half of Paris' population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from between 110,000 and 120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well, with a death toll of approximately 62,000 between 1346 and 1353. Florence's tax records suggest that 80% of the city's population died within four months in 1348. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. The disease bypassed some areas, with the most isolated areas being less vulnerable to contagion. Plague did not appear in Douai in Flanders until the turn of the 15th century, and the impact was less severe on the populations of Hainaut, Finland, northern Germany and areas of Poland. Monks, nuns and priests were especially hard-hit since they cared for people with the Black Death.\n\nThe physician to the Avignon Papacy, Raimundo Chalmel de Vinario (Latin: Magister Raimundus, lit.\u2009'Master Raymond'), observed the decreasing mortality rate of successive outbreaks of plague in 1347\u201348, 1362, 1371 and 1382 in his 1382 treatise On Epidemics (De epidemica). In the first outbreak, two thirds of the population contracted the illness and most patients died; in the next, half the population became ill but only some died; by the third, a tenth were affected and many survived; while by the fourth occurrence, only one in twenty people were sickened and most of them survived. By the 1380s in Europe, it predominantly affected children. Chalmel de Vinario recognised that bloodletting was ineffective (though he continued to prescribe bleeding for members of the Roman Curia, whom he disliked), and said that all true cases of plague were caused by astrological factors and were incurable; he himself was never able to effect a cure.The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death toll of about a third of the population. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population. In Cairo, with a population numbering as many as 600,000, and possibly the largest city west of China, between one third and 40% of the inhabitants died within eight months.Italian chronicler Agnolo di Tura recorded his experience from Siena, where plague arrived in May 1348:\n\nFather abandoned child, wife husband, one brother another; for this illness seemed to strike through the breath and sight. And so they died. And none could be found to bury the dead for money or friendship. Members of a household brought their dead to a ditch as best they could, without priest, without divine offices ... great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead. And they died by the hundreds both day and night ... And as soon as those ditches were filled more were dug ... And I, Agnolo di Tura ... buried my five children with my own hands. And there were also those who were so sparsely covered with earth that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured many bodies throughout the city. There was no one who wept for any death, for all awaited death. And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world.\n\nEconomic\nIt has been suggested that the plague, like some others in history, disproportionately affected the poorest people, who were already in generally worse physical condition than the wealthier citizens.  Nevertheless, with such a large overall population decline from the pandemic, wages soared in response to a labour shortage. On the other hand, in the quarter century after the Black Death in England, it is clear many labourers, artisans and craftsmen, those living from money-wages alone, did suffer a reduction in real incomes owing to rampant inflation. Landowners were also pushed to substitute monetary rents for labour services in an effort to keep tenants.\n\nEnvironmental\nA study performed by Thomas Van Hoof of the Utrecht University suggests that the innumerable deaths brought on by the pandemic cooled the climate by freeing up land and triggering reforestation. This may have led to the Little Ice Age.\n\nPersecutions\nRenewed religious fervour and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted \"various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims\", lepers and Romani, blaming them for the crisis. Lepers, and others with skin diseases such as acne or psoriasis, were killed throughout Europe.\nBecause 14th-century healers and governments were at a loss to explain or stop the disease, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for outbreaks. Many believed the epidemic was a punishment by God for their sins, and could be relieved by winning God's forgiveness.There were many attacks against Jewish communities. In the Strasbourg massacre of February 1349, about 2,000 Jews were murdered. In August 1349, the Jewish communities in Mainz and Cologne were annihilated. By 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed. During this period many Jews relocated to Poland, where they received a warm welcome from King Casimir the Great.\n\nSocial\nOne theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th-century Italy and led to the Renaissance. Italy was particularly badly hit by the pandemic, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art.This does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors, in combination with an influx of Greek scholars following the fall of the Byzantine Empire. As a result of the drastic reduction in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labour, workers travelled in search of the most favorable position economically.Prior to the emergence of the Black Death, the workings of Europe were run by the Catholic Church and the continent was considered a feudalistic society, composed of fiefs and city-states. The pandemic completely restructured both religion and political forces; survivors began to turn to other forms of spirituality and the power dynamics of the fiefs and city-states crumbled.Cairo's population, partly owing to the numerous plague epidemics, was in the early 18th century half of what it was in 1347. The populations of some Italian cities, notably Florence, did not regain their pre-14th century size until the 19th century. The demographic decline due to the pandemic had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30\u201340% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the pandemic found not only that the prices of food were lower but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives, and this probably destabilised feudalism.The word \"quarantine\" has its roots in this period, though the concept of isolating people to prevent the spread of disease is older. In the city-state of Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik, Croatia), a thirty-day isolation period was implemented in 1377 for new arrivals to the city from plague-affected areas. The isolation period was later extended to forty days, and given the name \"quarantino\" from the Italian word for \"forty\".\n\nRecurrences\nSecond plague pandemic\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. According to Jean-No\u00ebl Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. (Note that some researchers have cautions about the uncritical use of Biraben's data.) The second pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360\u201363; 1374; 1400; 1438\u201339; 1456\u201357; 1464\u201366; 1481\u201385; 1500\u201303; 1518\u201331; 1544\u201348; 1563\u201366; 1573\u201388; 1596\u201399; 1602\u201311; 1623\u201340; 1644\u201354; and 1664\u201367. Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century). The historian George Sussman argued that the plague had not occurred in East Africa until the 1900s. However, other sources suggest that the Second pandemic did indeed reach Sub-Saharan Africa.According to historian Geoffrey Parker, \"France alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628\u201331.\" In the first half of the 17th century, a plague killed some 1.7 million people in Italy. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain.The Black Death ravaged much of the Islamic world. Plague could be found in the Islamic world almost every year between 1500 and 1850. Sometimes the outbreaks affected small areas, while other outbreaks affected multiple regions. Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost 30,000\u201350,000 inhabitants to it in 1620\u201321, and again in 1654\u201357, 1665, 1691 and 1740\u201342. Cairo suffered more than fifty plague epidemics within 150 years from the plague's first appearance, with the final outbreak of the second pandemic there in the 1840s. Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century. Between 1701 and 1750, thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in Constantinople, and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800. Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population had died.\n\nThird plague pandemic\nThe third plague pandemic (1855\u20131859) started in China in the mid-19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named.Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia between 1900 and 1925 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus Yersinia pestis.The first North American plague epidemic was the San Francisco plague of 1900\u20131904, followed by another outbreak in 1907\u20131908.\n\nModern-day\nModern treatment methods include insecticides, the use of antibiotics, and a plague vaccine. It is feared that the plague bacterium could develop drug resistance and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995. A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014. In October 2017, the deadliest outbreak of the plague in modern times hit Madagascar, killing 170 people and infecting thousands.An estimate of the case fatality rate for the modern bubonic plague, following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, although it may be higher in underdeveloped regions.\n\nSee also\nBlack Death in England\nBlack Death in medieval culture\nCrisis of the Late Middle Ages\nFlagellant\nGlobalization and disease\nList of epidemics\nSecond plague pandemic\nTimeline of plague\nPassage 2:\nPatricia Millardet\nPatricia Millardet (24 March 1957 \u2212 13 April 2020) was a French movie and television actress, who played judge Silvia Conti in the Italian mafia series La piovra.She died of a heart attack in 2020 at the age of 63.\n\nPartial filmography\nPassage 3:\nLa Rosiere de Pessac\nLa Rosi\u00e8re de Pessac (The Virgin of Pessac) is the title of two hour-long films directed by Jean Eustache (in 1968 and 1979 respectively).

It is a recomposition of an Orlando furioso written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's impresa in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84. The libretto was by Grazio Braccioli.\n\nAuthorship\nFederico Maria Sardelli, according to the studies of Reinhard Strohm, argues that Orlando RV 819 was entirely recomposed by Vivaldi, starting from the original Ristori's opera that Vivaldi himself had already changed during the numerous representations of the season 1713. He assigned to it the catalogue number RV 819. One suggestion is that Vivaldi avoided putting his own name on the opera having himself only recently taken direction of the Teatro San Angelo. Against this others consider that the bulk of the opera is a copy of Ristori's lost work.\n\nOpera\nUnlike the Orlando furioso (RV 728) of 1727, in which the role of Orlando is sung by a contralto, the 1714 opera assigns the title role to a bass. The third act is missing and the rest of the score (evidently used in performances by the composer) is incomplete. Two arias are lost, seven arias are incomplete (only the bass part is extant) and three arias are identical with extant arias in RV 727 and RV 729.\n\nRecording\nThe French label Na\u00efve, which had already recorded the more famous Orlando furioso and Orlando finto pazzo for its Vivaldi Edition, released a recording of the July 20, 2012 premi\u00e8re at the Festival de Beaune, with Sardelli conducting Modo Antiquo and singers including Riccardo Novaro as Orlando, Ga\u00eblle Arquez as Angelica, Romina Basso as Alcina and Teodora Gheorghiu as Bradamante. Given the heavily defective nature of the surviving manuscript, Sardelli had to reconstruct or compose ex novo the seven incomplete arias, in a Vivaldian style.\n\nSee also\nList of operas by Antonio Vivaldi\nPassage 5:\nDenmark Place fire\nThe Denmark Place fire occurred on 16 August 1980 at 18 Denmark Place in Central London. The fire, caused by arson, killed 37 people of eight nationalities, most of whom were Spanish or Latin American, who were patrons of two unlicensed bars in the building. At the time, The Sunday Times suggested that it could be \"the worst mass murder in British history\".\n\nBackground\nThere were two unlicensed bars on the top two floors of 18 Denmark Place: The Spanish Rooms, a late night bar frequented by locals, including Irish and Jamaican immigrants; and Rodo's, also known as El Dandy, a salsa club popular with South American immigrants. Access to both of these bars was obtained by shouting up from the street below in order to obtain a key. The only way into both of these clubs was through a locked front door and up some stairs leading to a landing. \nAccess to the club on the lower floor was via this landing and access to the club on the upper floor was via a fire escape enclosed with plywood. Both bars, being unlicensed, were obscured from the outside world by boarded up windows and the door on Denmark Street that led to the fire escape was bolted shut. The Metropolitan Police were aware of the clubs and were planning to shut them both down on Monday 18 August. A farewell party was being thrown over the weekend.\n\nThe fire\nOn the night of 16 August 1980, John Thompson, a Scottish-born petty criminal aged 42, entered The Spanish Rooms and drank there. He believed that the barman had overcharged him for the drink. After fighting with the barman he was ejected from the building and the door was locked behind him. Thompson found a 2-gallon container outside the club, hailed a taxi and then travelled to a 24-hour petrol station in Camden where he filled the container with petrol. He then returned to 18 Denmark Place, poured the petrol through the letterbox of the front door and put a lit piece of paper through.Fire quickly took hold in the premises owing to the largely timber construction of the building. Both bars were badly damaged. There were estimated to be 150 people within the building at the time. People could not escape easily due to the boarded up windows, the locked fire escape and general lack of fire safety precautions owing to the bars' unlicensed status.The fire burned quickly through the wooden staircase, destroying the main entrance and exit to the bars. Some patrons tried to escape via the back door but found that this was locked. Others smashed windows and jumped out onto the street below. On Denmark Street there was a music shop that backed onto the clubs and some patrons were found here trapped behind the security shutters. One firefighter managed to rescue six people from this area.\nWhen firefighters were called to the fire at around 03:30 they could see smoke seeping from the shuttered windows. When an attempt was made to force the locked front door open they were showered with sparks and embers and were forced to retreat. Once firefighters were able to access the front door it took four minutes to break it down \u2013 behind it they found that the staircase was completely on fire.\nThe speed of the fire was so rapid that many of the bar patrons died where they were sitting or standing. An officer from the London Fire Brigade described the scene:\n\nPeople seem to have died on the spot without even having time to move an inch. Some were slumped at tables. Seven were at the bar and appear to have fallen as they stood, with drinks still in their hands.\n\nAftermath\nIn May 1981, Thompson was convicted on a specimen charge of murdering one of the victims, Archibald Campbell (aged 63) and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died of lung cancer on 16 August 2008, the 28th anniversary of the fire.There was comparatively little publicity about the fire, and no formal enquiry into it. The families of some of those who died were not aware of the circumstances. In 2022, after redevelopment of the site, a plaque was placed on a wall in memory.\n\nSee also\nBlue Bird Caf\u00e9 fire, 1972 fire in Montreal started in retaliations by patrons refused entry who then lit petrol in front of main entrance and only exit; also killed 37.\nHappy Land fire, 1990 fire in New York City at illegally operated nightclub started the same way by aggrieved ejected patron; resulting 87 fatalities is the worst mass murder in city history caused by a single person.\nClerkenwell cinema fire, 1994 fire in London at an illegally operated adult cinema, intentionally started by an aggrieved patron.\nGhost Ship warehouse fire, 2016 fire at illegally operated nightclub in California that killed 37\nPassage 6:\nList of bones of the human skeleton\nThe human skeleton of an adult consists of around 206 bones, depending on the counting of sternum (which may alternatively be included as the manubrium, body of sternum, and the xiphoid process). It is composed of 270 bones at the time of birth, but later decreases to 206: 80 bones in the axial skeleton and 126 bones in the appendicular skeleton. Many small accessory bones, such as sesamoid bones, are not included in this count.\n\nIntroduction\nAs a person ages, some bones fuse, a process which typically lasts until sometime within the third decade of life. Therefore, the number of bones in an individual may be evaluated differently throughout a lifetime. In addition, the bones of the skull and face are counted as separate bones, despite being fused naturally. Some reliable sesamoid bones such as the pisiform are counted, while others, such as the hallux sesamoids, are not.\nIndividuals may have more or fewer bones than the average (even accounting for developmental stage) owing to anatomical variations. The most common variations include sutural (wormian) bones, which are located along the sutural lines on the back of the skull, and sesamoid bones which develop within some tendons, mainly in the hands and feet. Some individuals may also have additional (i.e., supernumerary) cervical ribs or lumbar vertebrae. Amputations or other injuries may result in the loss of bones. Complete bone fractures may split one bone into multiple pieces. Other genetic conditions may result in abnormally higher (e.g. polydactyly or conjoined twins) or lower (e.g. oligodactyly) counts of bones.\n\nBones\nThe axial skeleton, comprising the spine, chest and head, contains 80 bones. The appendicular skeleton, comprising the arms and legs, including the shoulder and pelvic girdles, contains 126 bones, bringing the total for the entire skeleton to 206 bones. Infants are born with about 270 bones with most of it being cartilage, but will later fuse together and decrease over time to 206 bones.\n\nSpine (vertebral column)\nA fully grown adult features 26 bones in the spine, whereas a child can have 34.\n\nCervical vertebrae (7 bones)\nThoracic vertebrae (12 bones)\nLumbar vertebrae (5 bones)\nSacrum (5 bones at birth, fused into one after adolescence)\nCoccygeal vertebrae\/Cordal (set of 4 bones at birth; some or all fuse together, but there seems to be a disagreement between researchers as to what the most common number should be. Some say the most common is 1, others say 2 or 3, with 4 being the least likely. It is counted as 1 in this article.)\n\nChest (thorax)\nThere are 25 bones in the chest. The chest contains cartilage for the lungs to fill with air. \n\nSternum (1 or 3 bones.

The epicentre was Ba\u015fyurt in Elaz\u0131\u011f Province, in eastern Turkey. Initial reports in global media said as many as 57 people had died. By 10 March, reports in the Turkish media placed the death toll at 41 and later, the death toll rose to 42. Another 74 were injured, many after falling and jumping from buildings. A stampede through the streets led to further injuries.The earthquake came one week to the day after the Turkish Chamber of Civil Engineers sent a report to parliament detailing inadequate building projects and the possibility that Istanbul would be destroyed by an earthquake, which could kill tens of thousands of people, at some point in the next three decades.\n\nEarthquake\nThe quake occurred on the East Anatolian Fault, a major transform fault which represents  the boundary between the Anatolian Plate and the Arabian Plate.\n\nDamage\nAccording to officials, most of the deaths occurred in three villages: Ok\u00e7ular, Yukar\u0131 Kanatl\u0131 and Kayal\u0131. At least five villages, though, suffered loss of life. Villagers fled buildings, spending the night outside and lighting fires in the streets for warmth.Thirty houses collapsed in Ok\u00e7ular, and the death toll is at least 17. Reports from the scene indicate \"the village is totally flattened\" and \"everything has been knocked down \u2013 there is not a stone in place\".At least 25 people died in Yukar\u0131 Demirci, and emergency services went to Kovanc\u0131lar.Many people used vehicles and taxis to drive to the hospital. Most were asleep at the time the quake struck, with four sleeping sisters perishing in one house. Farm animals were also killed, and minarets fell down.\n\nAftershocks\nSeveral aftershocks were felt, the strongest measuring 5.5 (at 09:47 local time), 5.1 (at 12:14) and 5.3 (at 13:12). A total of over 20 aftershocks were counted within a short time following the quake. Villagers were told to stay away from buildings for several days due to the potential of further aftershocks.Onur Tan et al. (2011) analyzed 2130 aftershocks (ML\u22650.3) and reported in Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nResponse\nTurkey: Four government ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Cemil \u00c7i\u00e7ek, visited the scene as soon as news of the earthquake was reported. The Red Crescent and Turkey's disaster management centre donated blankets and tents. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan later arrived. Pakistan: Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani sent a condolence message to his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan over the loss of lives and property and said that \"We have learnt with utter sense of shock and profound sadness the news of the massive earthquake that has hit your beautiful country, today. Our hearts go out to our Turkish brethren over the loss of precious lives and destruction of property. I wish to convey, on behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan and on my own behalf our deepest condolences and commiserations to the people and Government of Turkey in bearing this enormous natural calamity.\" Israel: Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered an aid proposal to be put together but later said that Turkey informed Israel that it did not require assistance at this time.\n\nSee also\n2020 Elaz\u0131\u011f earthquake\nList of earthquakes in 2010\nList of earthquakes in Turkey\nPassage 8:\nLa Cantuta massacre\nLa Cantuta massacre took place in Peru on 18 July 1992, during the presidency of Alberto Fujimori. Supposed members of Shining Path, including a university professor and nine students from Lima's La Cantuta University, were abducted, tortured, and killed by Grupo Colina, a military death squad. The incident occurred two days after the Shining Path's Tarata bombing, which killed over 40 people in Lima Province.\nThe massacre was one of the crimes cited in the conviction of Fujimori on 7 April 2009, for human rights abuses.\n\nContext\nThe Enrique Guzm\u00e1n y Valle National Education University (Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n Enrique Guzm\u00e1n y Valle, or \"UNE\"; better known as \"La Cantuta\", from the neighbourhood in which it stands) was founded as a teacher-training college in 1822, granted its university charter in 1965, closed down by the military government in 1977, and reopened in 1980.Because of its remote location, far away from the centre of Lima, the fact that most of its students hailed from the impoverished interior of the country, and that most of them intended to enter the highly politicised teaching profession, La Cantuta gained a reputation as hotbed of radical politics, such as communism and anarchism as early as the late 1950s and early 1960s. A series of student-led protest actions on the campus \u2014 including the blocking of the railway line linking Lima with the interior of the country \u2014 that led to the suspension of its activities in 1977.With the return of democratic rule in 1980, President Bela\u00fande reopened the university. The radical elements among the students and lecturers were quick to return, and by the mid-1980s the country's two main insurgent groups, Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) and the T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), had a strong presence on campus, being widely regarded as 2 very legitimate organisations. By the early 1990s, due to a strategic withdrawal by MRTA and the fragmentation of the other left-wing groups on campus, legal and illegal alike, Sendero Luminoso had the upper hand. This was in spite of operations such as that of 13 February 1987, when 4000 police officers conducted night-time raids at the dormitories of three state universities (including La Cantuta); 20 April 1989, when a joint force of police and army descended on La Cantuta University and San Marcos National University and arrested over 500 students on charges of subversion; or 22 May 1991, when, in response to a hostage crisis and rumors of an explosive device squirreled away on campus, Fujimori sent the army in to restore law and order at La Cantuta. Graffiti alluding to Sendero Luminoso and its leader, Abimael Guzm\u00e1n, were painted over with patriotic slogans; students went about their business only after passing checkpoints and under close supervision from the armed forces; and the campus remained under military control for several years.\n\nAbduction of July 1992\nIn the pre-dawn hours of 18 July 1992, two days after the Tarata bombing, members of the Army Intelligence Service (SIE) and the Army Directorate of Intelligence (DINTE), most of whom were attached to the recently established Grupo Colina death squad, burst into the residences of the Enrique Guzm\u00e1n y Valle National University.Once inside, the troops forced all the students to leave their rooms and lie belly-down on the floor. Nine students believed to be linked to the Tarata Bombing \u2014 Bertila Lozano Torres, Dora Oyague Fierro, Luis Enrique Ortiz Perea, Armando Richard Amaro C\u00f3ndor, Robert \u00c9dgar Teodoro Espinoza, Her\u00e1clides Pablo Meza, Felipe Flores Chipana, Marcelino Rosales C\u00e1rdenas, and Juan Gabriel Mari\u00f1os Figueroa \u2014 were separated from the others and taken away. Meanwhile, in the staff residences, a group of soldiers broke into the home of professor Hugo Mu\u00f1oz S\u00e1nchez. After searching his bedroom, they gagged the professor and led him away.\n\nProsecutions and amnesty\nIn April 1993, a group of Peruvian military officers anonymously released a document detailing the events at La Cantuta. Their document claimed the death squad had abducted the victims, tortured and murdered them, and then hurriedly buried them; later, they claimed, after questions had been raised in Congress, that the armed forces had exhumed, incinerated, and reburied the bodies in another location. The military whistleblowers named the members of Grupo Colina involved, identified the operations chief as Major Santiago Mart\u00edn Rivas, and suggested that the group operated on the orders of Vladimiro Montesinos, head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) and a close advisor to President Fujimori.\nOn 6 May, Lt. Gen. Humberto Robles Espinoza, the army's third highest-ranking officer, publicly denounced a number of human rights violations committed by the SIN and the armed forces, including the La Cantuta killings. He was later dismissed from duty and subjected to death threats, and finally fled the country for political asylum in Argentina.In June 1993, Justo Arizapana Vicente, a recycler, and his friend Guillermo Cataroca, leaked a marked map to congress man Roger C\u00e1ceres Vel\u00e1squez and Radio Comas journalist Juan Jara Berrospi. C\u00e1ceres then shared the map with Ricardo Uceda at the news magazine S\u00ed, who published it in July of that year. Mariella Barreto, an agent of the Peruvian Army Intelligence Service, is also sometimes credited with leaking this map to a Peruvian magazine. An investigation of the site indicated on the map by the public prosecutor revealed four clandestine graves. Forensic tests conducted on the remains, and on another set of bones found at another site, revealed that they belonged to Mu\u00f1oz S\u00e1nchez and the students Luis Enrique Ortiz Perea, Armando Amaro Condor, and Juan Gabriel Mari\u00f1os Figueroa, and that at least some of them had been tortured prior to receiving an execution-style coup-de-gr\u00e2ce to the base of the neck. Barreto was murdered some years later: her decapitated and dismembered corpse, showing signs of ante-mortem torture, was found in March 1997. A few weeks after Mariella Barreto's death, her colleague Leonor La Rosa, was on TV in a hospital bed, declaring she had been tortured and that Barreto had been killed in retaliation for leaking information to the press about the Groupo Colina's plan to intimidate journalists and politicians from the opposition.The military authorities had begun an investigation into the killings in May 1993. In addition, in December 1993, a civilian prosecutor filed criminal charges against several named members of the military. A conflict of jurisdiction thus arose between the military and civilian courts. The controversy was placed before the Supreme Court which, on 3 February 1994, ruled that it was unable to reach agreement on which venue should apply. Consequently, on the night of 7 February, Congress enacted a new law whereby the Supreme Court could decide such matters with a simple majority, instead of a unanimous vote. By a three-to-two vote of the Supreme Court's criminal division, the case was placed under military jurisdiction.On 21 February 1994, the Supreme Council of Military Justice (CSJM) sentenced ten of the perpetrators to prison sentences of between one and 20 years.Following Fujimori's landslide re-election in April 1995, in another all-night session on 14 June 1995, Congress enacted law No. 26479, the \"Amnesty Law\", ordering the release of all police officers, soldiers, and civil servants convicted of or charged with civilian or military crimes during Peru's War on Terrorism. On 15 July, the Supreme Council of Military Justice ordered the release of all the individuals convicted for the La Cantuta killings.\n\nRepeal of the Amnesty Law\nThe Amnesty Law was repealed after the Fujimori government in 2000 and, on 21 March 2001, Attorney General Nelly Calder\u00f3n presented charges against Fujimori, accusing him of being one of the \"co-authors\" of this massacre and of the 1991 Barrios Altos massacre. She presented evidence that Fujimori, acting in concert with SIN supremo Vladimiro Montesinos, exercised control over Grupo Colina. The charges alleged that the group could not have committed crimes of this magnitude without Fujimori's express orders or consent, and that the formation and function of the Colina group was part of an overall counter-insurgency policy that involved systematic violations of human rights.\n\nProsecutions and apology\nIn November 2005, Fujimori was detained in Chile. Peruvian authorities filed for his extradition to face charges arising from various incidents during his presidency, including the La Cantuta massacre, and he was returned to Peru on 22 September 2007.\nOn 8 April 2008, a court found a number of people, including Julio Salazar, guilty of kidnapping, homicide, and forced disappearance.In October 2007, pursuant to a 2006 ruling from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the government extended a formal apology for the massacre and undertook to make amends to the victims' next-of-kin, including compensation in the amount of US$1.8 million.\n\nFujimori's trial\nDuring the trial of Alberto Fujimori, it was asserted by former Colina member Jos\u00e9 William Tena Jacinto that at least two of the victims were positively identified as Shining Path members.Lieutenant Aquilino Portella and the Dean of the Social Science Department of the University, Claudio Cajahuaringa, have also claimed that Professor Hugo Mu\u00f1oz S\u00e1nchez and student Bertila Lozano Torres were involved with Shining Path. In the case of Lozano, it was claimed that documents allegedly in her possession revealed that she was indeed an actual member of the insurgent organization.In 2009 it was determined by a judicial ruling that not a single one of the victims in La Cantuta massacre was linked to any terrorist organization, it was in the same ruling that condemned Fujimori to a 25 years imprisonment for crimes against humanity.\n\nSee also\nList of massacres in Peru\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\"The La Canuta Case\".

It was first performed on 28 August 1721 at the Teatro Regio Ducale in Milan on the occasion of the birthday celebrations of the Austrian Empress Elisabeth Christine, wife of Emperor Charles VI of Austria.\n\nBackground\nIn 1718 Vivaldi had been nominated maestro di cappella di camera, at the court of Philipp von Hessen-Darmstadt in Mantua for whom he composed Armida al campo d'Egitto, Teuzzone, Scanderbeg (all 1718) and then Tito Manlio (1719) and La Candace (1720). On his return to Venice, following performance of La verit\u00e0 in cimento at the Teatro Sant'Angelo, Vivaldi, thinly disguised as \"Aldiviva\", became, along with Giovanni Porta, Anna Maria Strada and others, one of the principal targets of the gentleman-composer Benedetto Marcello's satirical pamphlet Il teatro alla moda (written 1718-1719, published 1720).Bissari's text had originally been written in 1710 as a play for Princess Teresa Kunegunda Sobieska, second wife of the Bavarian elector Maximillian II Emmanuel. The opera was performed again in Milan in 1723 and 1724. 8 of the arias are preserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale di Torino.\n\nRoles\nRecordings\n2001 (reconstruction of nine surviving arias) Roberta Invernizzi, Gloria Banditelli, John Elwes, Philippe Cantor.

In 1764 he made his appearance in Paris as a mandolin virtuoso and was highly esteemed, both as a performer and teacher. He published his Method for the mandolin while residing in Paris, which met with great success throughout France, being the most popular of its period.\nHis chief works were the operas L'Italienne and Pierre et Lucette, the former being an opera bouffe in one act (with the storyline or libretto by Nicolas-\u00c9tienne Framery). These works were commissioned by the Comedie Italienne, Paris, and were produced at this theatre successfully, in 1770 and 1774.

The Talbot family had been locally prominent in Herefordshire since the reign of Henry II of England, and had blood connections to both the Welsh and Scottish nobility. His father died in 1356, resulting in his succession as the third Baron Talbot.\n\nMilitary career\nTalbot served in several English military campaigns. He fought in the Hundred Years War under the Black Prince, and was with the royal fleet under Admiral Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk. During the Peasants' Revolt, he was one of the commissioners tasked with raising forces to fight the rebels. He served under the Earl of Cambridge in Portugal and Spain in 1381\u20131382, and was present at the capture of Higuera la Real. During this Iberian service, he was chosen as the ambassador of the English forces to the king of Portugal to demand their wages. He returned to England, where he was called to Newcastle in 1385 for service against the Scots. He returned to Spain in 1386 with John of Gaunt when the latter was pressing his claim to the throne of Castile. He died of the plague while in Spain in 1387.\n\nMarriages and children\nTalbot was married twice. Prior to 1361, he married Petronilla, daughter of James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond by his wife Eleanor de Bohun. They had two children:\nRichard Talbot, 4th Baron Talbot, his son and heir.

He seems to have been a spendthrift, and left significant debts at his death. A year earlier, he had been pardoned for outlawry after failing to answer the Earl of Arundel concerning a debt of \u00a33000. The economic problems he left behind were still affecting the Talbot family in the time of his grandson, the fifth baron.\nPassage 4:\nLawrie McKinna\nLawrie McKinna (born 8 July 1961) is a Scottish-Australian former football player, coach, and former Mayor of Gosford City Council.\nIn 2012, McKinna stood for election as an independent for City of Gosford. Lawrie was successful in gaining a seat, and was elected by his fellow councillors Mayor of Gosford City on 24 September.He was removed from his position as Mayor, as a result of the amalgamation of Gosford and Wyong Councils on 12 May 2016.\nLawrie unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in the September 2013 Federal election for the seat of Robertson. His campaign was backed by John Singleton to the tune of $380,000. While receiving 8.7% of the vote, Singleton and McKinna controversially decided the outcome of the seat by directing preference votes to the conservative Liberal Party candidate Ms Lucy Wicks. Ms Wicks formally thanked Lawrie & his backer John Singleton in her maiden speech in parliament.\n\nEarly life\nMcKinna was born in Galston in southwest Scotland.\n\nPlaying career\nClub\nMcKinna began his career as a striker with local junior side Darvel and made his debut for Scottish Football League side Kilmarnock in 1982. He made 87 league appearances for Kilmarnock, scoring 17 times before moving to Australia in 1986 where he went on to play for several more clubs in the NSL and various state leagues.\n\nManagement career\nMcKinna's coaching career began in 1992 with New South Wales side Blacktown City as assistant manager. In 1995 Hills United hired him as a player\/manager (http:\/\/www.hillsbrumbies.com.au\/). In 1997, he became assistant to David Mitchell with National Soccer League clubs Sydney Olympic, then following Mitchell to Sydney United in 1998 and Parramatta Power in 1999.\nHe left Parramatta Power in 2002 to take over as manager of Northern Spirit. His first season as a NSL coach was extremely promising and successful as he beat many accomplished coaches, and was awarded with the NSL coach of the year award after taking the Northern Spirit to their first finals campaign for three years.\n\nCentral Coast Mariners\nIn 2005, he was named as manager of the new A-League club the Central Coast Mariners, earning the inaugural A-League coach of the year award after leading the Mariners to the grand final and winning the preseason cup. In May 2006 he signed a new five-year contract with the Mariners.McKinna was popular in the community for his insistence that all the players at the club engaged in community activities. This became a hallmark of his tenure at the fledgling club.\nIn the 2006\/2007 season, McKinna gave an interview during which his team were struggling for on field success. Notably saying how it was frustrating for him when the press report losses in matches but don't mention the long-term injury's to the sides key players like Nik Mrdja, Andre Gumprecht and Noel Spencer. In the interview he also talked about his footballing coaching licenses and mentions that he would be preparing to take his '\"Asian 'B' license\" course soon.On 9 February 2010, it was announced that McKinna will take over as the Football and Commercial Operations Manager for the Mariners from the 2010\/2011 season, with Graham Arnold replacing him as head coach.\n\nChengdu Blades\nChinese Super League club Chengdu Blades have shown interest in McKinna taking over the reins as manager of the first team on 18 March 2011. A day later, he was appointed as the head coach of Chengdu Blades  a club known to have the lowest operating budget in the CSL.\nOn 15 August, it was confirmed by McKinna via his Twitter account, that he had resigned from his position as manager at the Blades. He cited off-field, back room issues as a major reason for his decision, which contributed to the Blades poor 2011 CSL season, in which at the time of McKinna's departure had seen them only win only twice, conceding 30+ goals, whilst only scoring 13, and the club at the bottom of the ladder after just 20 matches.\n\nChongqing Lifan\nOn 2 December 2011 it was announced that McKinna had signed a one-year contract with China League One side Chongqing Lifan. On 15 April 2012 he announced he was leaving the club after a disagreement with the board.\n\nCentral Coast Mariners\nOn 4 May 2012 it was announced that Lawrie would become the new Director of Football for the Central Coast Mariners. A position that he took on again temporarily for two months in 2014.\n\nNewcastle Jets\nIn June 2016, McKinna was appointed chief executive of the Newcastle Jets.\n\nAfter football\nMcKinna was elected a councillor of Gosford City Council in September 2012 and nominated as Mayor at the first council meeting.In the 2013 Australian election, McKinna ran as a conservative independent for the seat of Robertson.\n\nManagerial statistics\nAs of February 2010\n\nHonours\nPlayer\nClub\nAPIA Leichhardt:\n\nNSL Cup: 1988\n\nManager\nClub\nCentral Coast Mariners:\n\nA-League Championship:Finalists: 2006, 2008\nA-League Premiership: 2007\u201308\nA-League Challenge Cup: 2005Finalists: 2006\n\nIndividual\nNSL Coach of the Year: 2002\u201303\nA-League Coach of the Year: 2005\u20132006\nPassage 5:\nRalph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland\nRalph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland (c. 1456 \u2013 6 February 1499) was an English peer. He was the grandfather of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland.\n\nOrigins\nHe was born in about 1456, the only child of John Neville, Baron Neville (younger brother of Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland) by his wife Anne Holland, daughter of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter (1395-1447).\n\nCareer\nNeville's father was slain fighting for the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461, and attainted on 4 November of that year. On 6 October 1472 Ralph Neville obtained the reversal of his father's attainder and the restoration of the greater part of his estates, and thereby became Lord Neville (1459 creation).On 18 April 1475 Neville was created a Knight of the Bath together with the sons of King Edward IV. He was a justice of the peace in Durham. For his 'good services against the rebels', on 23 March 1484 King Richard III granted Neville manors in Somerset and Berkshire and the reversion of lands which had formerly belonged to Margaret, Countess of Richmond. In September 1484 he was a commissioner to keep the truce with Scotland. On 3 November 1484 his uncle, Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, died, and Neville succeeded as 3rd Earl of Westmorland and Lord Neville (1295 creation).After the Yorkist defeat at Bosworth, Westmorland entered into bonds to the new king, Henry VII, of \u00a3400 and 400 marks, and on 5 December 1485, he gave custody (and the approval of the marriage of his eldest son and heir), Ralph Neville (d.1498), to the King.Westmorland held a command in the army sent into Scotland in 1497 after James IV supported the pretensions to the crown of Perkin Warbeck.\n\nDeath\nWestmorland's eldest son died in 1498. Westmorland died at Hornby Castle, Yorkshire, the seat of his son-in-law, Sir William Conyers, on 6 February 1499, allegedly of grief for his son's death, and was buried in the parish church there. His grandson, Ralph Neville, succeeded to the earldom as 4th Earl of Westmorland.\n\nMarriage and issue\nBefore 20 February 1473, Neville married Isabel Booth, the daughter of Sir Roger Booth, esquire (1396\u20131467) and Catherine Hatton, and the niece of Lawrence Booth, Archbishop of York, by whom he had a son and a daughter:\nRalph Neville, Lord Neville (d. 1498). As noted above, on 5 December 1485, his father had granted his custody (and the approval of the marriage of his eldest son) to the King. Accordingly, Lord Neville married firstly, in the presence of King Henry VII and his Queen, Elizabeth of York, Mary Paston (born 19 January 1470), the eldest daughter of Sir William Paston (b. 1436 \u2013 died before 7 September 1496) by Lady Anne Beaufort, daughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. She died of measles at court, about Christmas 1489. There were no issue of the marriage.\nLady Anne Neville, who married firstly, William Conyers, 1st Baron Conyers, and secondly, Anthony Saltmarsh (1473\u20131550) of Langton by Wragby, Lincolnshire.Lord Neville married secondly, again in the royal presence, Edith Sandys (d. 22 August 1529), sister of William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys, by whom he had three children:\n\nRalph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland\na son who died young\nCecilia Neville, who married John Weston, son of John Weston Jr. and Virginia Alice Edshaw, and was the mother of Dr Robert Weston, Lord Chancellor of IrelandAfter Lord Neville's death in 1498, his widow Edith married Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy, who was beheaded on Tower Hill on 30 June 1537.\n\nFootnotes\nPassage 6:\nSir Archibald Acheson, 1st Baronet\nSir Archibald Acheson of Glencairn, Lord Glencairn, 1st Baronet (1583 \u2013 9 September 1634), was a Scottish jurist.\n\nBiography\nAcheson was the son of Captain Patrick Acheson and Martha Drummond.On 31 March 1620, \"Archibald Acheson, a Scotchman\", was knighted at Theobalds by King James I, and in 1621 he was appointed Master in Chancery of Ireland. Sometime before 25 October 1626 he was appointed a Lord of Session of Scotland as 'Lord Glencairn'. On 21 October 1627, he was appointed by King Charles I as Royal Secretary of State of Scotland. On 1 January 1628, he was made a Baronet of Nova Scotia.Lord Glencairn died at Letterkenny, County Donegal, in the west of Ulster in September 1634.\n\nIreland\nIn 1610, at the start of the Plantation of Ulster, numerous land grants were made in the precinct of Fewes in County Armagh. One was of 2,000 acres to Sir James Douglas, Knt., of Spott, Haddingtonshire, subsequently sold the next year to Henry Acheson, who afterwards sold it to Sir Archibald Acheson. A further 1,000 acres originally granted to Henry was also sold on to Sir Archibald Acheson in 1628. Acheson does not ever appear to have resided in Ireland, however, and his position in the Court of Chancery there appears titular; his judicial duties were all in Scotland. He nevertheless became a \"denizen\" of Ireland on 12 February 1618, presumably in order to qualify for the lands he was receiving from his brother, Henry Acheson of Dromlech, County Armagh. Certainly Sir Archibald's second son, George, resided in Ireland.\n\nFamily\nAcheson wed Agnes Vernor at some point before 1610, fathering an eldest son, Sir Patrick Acheson, 2nd Baronet (c.1611-1638). Sir John Scot (1754) states that this son died after his first year of marriage, to an English heiress, without issue.\nAfter his first wife died, Sir Archibald remarried in 1622, Margaret, daughter of Sir John Hamilton and Johanna Everard, by whom he had a son, George (1629\u20131685).By his first wife he had a daughter, Jean, who married Sir Lewis Lauder of Over Gogar & Alderston, Knt., (c1599-c1640), Sheriff-Principal of Edinburgh and son of Sir Alexander Lauder of Haltoun, Knt. They had at least three known children. Jean was still living on 3 April 1663 as \"relict of Sir Lewes Lauder of Over Gogar\".Lord Glencairn may have had another daughter by one of his marriages, Isabella Acheson of Gosford, who married Hector Og Maclean (1583\u20131623). Sources list her as the daughter of \"Sir Archibald Acheson\", but because of her age, she may have been the daughter of Captain Patrick Acheson or one of his siblings. If she was the same age as Hector Og Maclean, she would have been born in 1583 and would have had her first child around 1600 at age 17. If she was the daughter of Sir Archibald Acheson she would be born no earlier than 1610 the year Archibald married. This would make her at least 20 years younger than Hector Og Maclean, and would make her the same age as her own children. This is the error in the standard genealogy.His eldest son Patrick succeeded him to the baronetcy but having died without issue several years after his father, whereupon the title passed to his half-brother Sir George Acheson, 3rd Baronet, who relocated to Ireland and in 1657 was High Sheriff of Counties Armagh and Tyrone.\nPassage 7:\nArchibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford\nArchibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford KP (20 August 1806 \u2013 15 June 1864), styled Viscount Acheson between 1807 and 1849, was a British peer and Member of Parliament.\n\nEarly life\nGosford was born on 20 August 1806. He was the only son of Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford of Gosford Castle, County Armagh and the former Mary Sparrow (1777\u20131841).

He was Lord of the bedchamber between 1831-1834. He succeeded to his father's Irish titles and estates in 1849, including the 2,800 acres (4.4 sq mi; 11 km2) Worlingham Hall estate which he sold at auction in August 1849.

He became vice-admiral of Ulster, also received the Order of the Dannebrog, and the Order of the White Eagle (Russian Empire). Since there are two United Kingdom peerages (e.g. Baron Worlingham) subsumed in that Irish Earldom, he was entitled to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was Lord Lieutenant of Armagh from 1883 to 1920, and served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household of Queen Alexandra from 1901.He was Honorary Colonel of the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Irish Fusiliers from 1899, and Vice-Admiral of Ulster.

Gosford was the son of Arthur Acheson, 1st Earl of Gosford, and his wife Millicent (n\u00e9e Pole). He succeeded his father to his titles and estates in 1807.\n\nCareer\nAcheson sat in the Irish House of Commons for County Armagh from 1798 until the Act of Union in 1801, when Ireland became part of the United Kingdom. Subsequently, he was a Member of the British House of Commons representing Armagh to 1807, when he succeeded to his father's Irish titles as Earl of Gosford. He entered the British House of Lords in 1811 upon being elected an Irish Representative Peer.In 1831 he was appointed the first Lord Lieutenant of Armagh for life, having previously been a Governor of Armagh since 1805. The new position incorporated the post of Custos Rotulorum of County Armagh which he also already held. He was created Baron Worlingham in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1835 and thus became a member of the UK House of Lords in his own right. He commissioned Thomas Hopper (1776\u20131856) to design a new house, Gosford Castle on his Gosford estate. The house would not be completed until after his death.\nIn 1835, he became Governor General of British North America (also Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada), and commissioner in the Royal Commission for the Investigation of all Grievances Affecting His Majesty's Subjects of Lower Canada. He was instructed to appease the reformists, led by Louis-Joseph Papineau, without giving them any real power. Gosford attempted to distance himself from his predecessor, Lord Aylmer, who had exacerbated the hostility of French-Canadians to the British administration. Gosford officially established the Diocese of Montreal in 1836, though it had been unofficially created a few years before. In August of that year Gosford dissolved the Legislative Assembly when they refused to pass his budget.In November, Lord Gosford learned of the planned Lower Canada Rebellion and had many of Papineau's followers arrested, although Papineau himself escaped to the United States. The next month, he issued a reward for the capture of Papineau, and declared martial law in Lower Canada.\nLord Gosford resigned in November 1837 and returned to Britain the next year. His eventual successor, Lord Durham, implemented the Act of Union 1840, uniting Lower and Upper Canada, which Lord Gosford had unsuccessfully argued against.\n\nPersonal life\nHe married Mary Sparrow, the daughter and heiress of Robert Sparrow of Worlingham Hall, Suffolk, with whom he had a son and four daughters.\nArchibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford (20 August 1806 \u2013 15 June 1864), he succeeded his father upon his death.\nLady Mary Acheson (27 June 1809 \u2013 13 March 1850).

{"context":"Passage 1:\nMiddletown, Kentucky\nMiddletown is an independent, home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States, and a former neighborhood of Louisville. The population was 7,218 at the 2010 census.\nThe city is also home to the main campus of the largest church in the state (and one of the country's largest Protestant churches), the Southeast Christian Church.\n\nHistory\nThe City of Middletown was originally incorporated in 1797 by the Jefferson County Court on 500 acres of land lying on a branch of the forks of Beargrass Creek that originally belonged to Jacob Meyers and Culberth Harrison. Though there is no recorded explanation why the city was named Middletown, it is commonly believed that that name was chosen because the town was in the \"middle\" of the two older cities of Louisville which was founded June 24, 1778, and Shelbyville, which was founded December 20, 1792. In 1871 the Kentucky General Assembly amended the original charter to increase Middletown's boundaries.\nAfter failing to hold elections and collect taxes after 1919, Circuit Judge McCauley Smith dissolved the city's charter on July 26, 1960, and Middletown lost its 163-year-old city status.

Immediately afterwards, Grayson experienced several years of commercial sector growth, mainly to serve the Interstate 64 traffic. Since 1990, the city has also seen significant growth in the residential sector with the Interstate making for a faster trip to and from Ashland. Beginning in 1995, AA Highway terminates in Grayson making the city a gateway to the Huntington-Ashland urban area.\n\nHistory\nAfter the Revolutionary War, George Washington's aide-de-camp Col. William Grayson received a 70,000-acre (280 km2) tract of land for his service during the war from the state of Virginia. By 1838, a small portion of this tract was set aside for the development of a town named for him.

The population was 26,595 at the 2010 U.S. census.\nIt is a major suburb of Louisville. When the Louisville Metro government was established in 2003, Jeffersontown chose to retain its status as an independent city. It is the metro area's largest municipality outside Louisville.  Locally, the city is often referred to by the abbreviated name J-town.\n\nHistory\nBefore European exploration, this was occupied by succeeding cultures of Native Americans. They hunted the area for its rich game, including bison herds. The bison created paths through the forests and meadows for their seasonal migrations that were later used by Native Americans and, in turn, by Europeans and Americans alike.\nLocated in southeastern Jefferson County, along the north central border of Kentucky, Jeffersontown was initially developed in the late 1700s as a stopover and trading station for early European-American pioneers on their way to the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville. Farmers began to cultivate the rich land, which was surveyed by Thomas Bullitt in 1773 and John Floyd the next year. The Hites, Tylers, and Oldhams all settled the area under land grants given to veterans for military service following the American Revolutionary War, as the new government was cash poor.In 1794, Abraham Bruner purchased 122 acres (49 ha) of land. In May 1797, he successfully petitioned the Jefferson County Fiscal Court to incorporate a 40-acre (16 ha) section of his land as the city of Jefferson \u2013 named either after the county or after Thomas Jefferson, then the vice president of the United States. The city was long known as Bruner's Town or Brunerstown by its inhabitants, but the usage Jefferson Town eventually became adopted as its present name.A large, 600-acre area from the pioneer days has been preserved since the late 20th century and recognized as the Tyler Settlement Rural Historic District. It is used largely for agricultural purposes. This district is east of Jeffersontown; it contains several of the Tylers' original log cabins and barns.

Morehead's steam-powered gristmill. A larger community began to develop after the 1870 advent of the Elizabethtown and Paducah Railroad. A post office was constructed the next year in 1871 and called \"Owensboro Junction\" after the projected 1872 completion of the Owensboro and Russellville Railroad. By 1873, the settlement was large enough to be incorporated by the state legislature as \"Stroud City\", after local landowner John Stroud.The same year, however, the du Ponts' Central Coal and Iron Company began operation in the area and became so vital to the local economy that the city was re\u00efncorporated in 1882 as \"Central City\". Recessions replaced the E&P and the O&R with a procession of different companies, including the Owensboro and Nashville Railway, but the two rights of way always remained in separate hands, keeping Central City an important regional hub for the Illinois Central and the L&N, with train yards, roundhouses, and even an elevated rail station. Coal was mined from nearby fields, prompting explosions such as one in 1912 that killed five workers.The expansion of automotive traffic in the early 20th century reduced some of Central City's importance, but it continues to service mainline freight traffic on the Paducah and Louisville Railway and trunk-line service for CSX from Madisonville to the Paradise Combined Cycle Plant, minutes south of the city.\nCentral City is the only city in Muhlenberg County that allows liquor to be sold by package stores and by the drink in restaurants seating at least 100 persons.

Located on the Mississippi River, the city had a population of 2,365 at the 2020 U.S. census and is classified as a home rule-class city. Hickman is part of the Union City micropolitan area.\n\nHistory\nThis area was long occupied by various cultures of indigenous peoples. European-American settlement of this area did not begin until decades after the American Revolutionary War. James Mills built the first cabin on the site in 1819. The community of Mills Point was large enough to receive a post office in 1830. Around 1834, G. Marr purchased much of the surrounding area and laid out more streets.The community was renamed Hickman in 1837 after the maiden name of Marr's wife. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly on February 18, 1841. In 1845, it became the county seat.David Walker, his wife, and their four children were lynched in Hickman in 1908 after Mr. Walker was accused of using inappropriate language with a white woman. Two floods devastated Hickman, the first in 1912 and the second in 1913.  The flood of 1912 began when a levee located near Hickman broke. Within a few hours the water had risen to the roofs of houses. The flood of 1913 began when a levee near West Hickman broke on April 4. Baseball pitcher Rube Waddell was among the many who helped save the city during both floods. Waddell came down with pneumonia after each flood; he died of tuberculosis.\n\nRegistered historic sites\nThomas Chapel C.M.E. Church is an historic African-American church on Moscow Avenue in Hickman, part of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church formed by freedmen after the American Civil War. Freedmen set up their own denomination in order to be independent of white supervision in the Methodist Church, South, which had split away from northern congregations at the outbreak of war. (In 1954 the CME changed its name to Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.) The church in Hickman was built in 1895. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.6 square miles (9.3 km2), of which 3.6 square miles (9.3 km2) is land and 0.28% is water.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.  According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Hickman has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps.\n\nDemographics\n2020 census\nAs of the 2020 United States Census, there were 2,365 people, 752 households, and 385 families residing in the city.\n\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,560 people, 1,015 households, and 665 families residing in the city.

The population was 431 as of the 2010 census.\n\nGeography\nMoorland is located in northeastern Jefferson County at 38\u00b016\u203223\u2033N 85\u00b034\u203245\u2033W (38.273020, -85.579048). It is bordered to the south, east, and west by Lyndon, and to the north by consolidated Louisville\/Jefferson County. It is 11 miles (18 km) east of downtown Louisville.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.09 square miles (0.24 km2), all land.\n\nDemographics\nAt the 2000 census there were 464 people in 206 households, including 127 families, in the city.

It is separately incorporated as a home rule-class city. The population was 136 as of the 2010 census.\n\nGeography\nMeadowbrook Farm is located in northeastern Jefferson County at 38\u00b016\u203240\u2033N 85\u00b034\u203232\u2033W (38.277772, -85.575669). It is bordered to the southwest by Lyndon, to the northeast by Meadow Vale, and on all other sides by consolidated Louisville\/Jefferson County. Downtown Louisville is 12 miles (19 km) to the southwest.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Meadowbrook Farm has a total area of 0.03 square miles (0.07 km2), all land.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 146 people, 53 households, and 41 families residing in the city. The population density was 4,828.7 inhabitants per square mile (1,864.4\/km2). There were 53 housing units at an average density of 1,752.9 per square mile (676.8\/km2).

As of the 2020 census, the city population was 7,856. \nCorbin is on Interstate 75 and US Route 25W, about halfway between Knoxville, Tennessee, and Lexington.\n\nHistory\nThe first settlement in the Corbin area was known as Lynn Camp Station. The first post office was called Cummins, for community founder Nelson Cummins. It was discovered in 1885 that both Cummins and Lynn Camp were already in use as names for Kentucky post offices, and postmaster James Eaton was asked to select another name. He chose Corbin for the Rev. James Corbin Floyd, a local minister. The town was incorporated under that name in 1905.\nCorbin has a troubled racial past, including a race riot in late October 1919 in which a white mob forced nearly all the town's 200 black residents onto a freight train out of town and a sundown town policy until the late 20th century. The event is the subject of a 1991 documentary, Trouble Behind. In October 2019, city leaders marked the riot's centennial with a proclamation acknowledging the riot and former sundown town policy.For most of its history, the urbanized areas of Corbin in Laurel County were not incorporated into the city limits due to a state law prohibiting cities from being in more than two counties. However, a 2021 change to state law allowed cities to voluntarily annex property in a third county if the city already provides public infrastructure to that property. In March 2022, the Corbin City Commission approved an annexation request for a property in Laurel County.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Corbin has a total area of 7.9 sq mi (20 km2), with only a tiny fraction of 0.044 sq mi (0.11 km2), or 0.56%, consisting of water.\nCorbin lies in the Cumberland Plateau region of Appalachia in southeastern Kentucky, along Interstate 75 and U.S. Route 25W. I-75 provides access to the city from exit 25, leading north 89 miles (143 km) to Lexington and south 86 miles (138 km) to Knoxville, Tennessee. U.S. 25W runs through the center of town, leading north 14 miles (23 km) to London (via U.S. Route 25) and south 21 miles (34 km) to Williamsburg.\nThe Pine Mountain Overthrust Fault, a geologic fault system several miles to the east, produces occasional tremors, the most recent in 2008.\n\nClimate\nCorbin exhibits a humid subtropical climate, typical of southeastern Kentucky. The region experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold, with mild periods. Summers are generally hot and humid, with variable spring and fall seasons. Precipitation is common year-round but more prevalent in the summer months\u2014the surrounding mountains somewhat moderate Corbin's climate.\n\nDemographics\nCorbin is in the London, Kentucky micropolitan area, whose current boundaries were established in 2013 by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in coordination with the United States Census Bureau. Previously, the London micropolitan area had consisted solely of Laurel County, while the Whitley County portion of Corbin was the principal city of its own micropolitan area that consisted solely of that county. Both entities were in turn the components of a statistical entity officially known as the \"Corbin\u2013London, KY Combined Statistical Area\". The CSA had a combined population of 94,486 at the 2010 census. The Knox County portion of Corbin was outside the former Corbin\u2013London statistical area but is now included in the redefined London micropolitan area.\nAs of the 2010 census there were 7,304 people, 3,093 households, and 1,903 families residing in the city. The population density was 920.1 inhabitants per square mile (355.3\/km2). There were 3,507 housing units at an average density of 441.8 per square mile (170.6\/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 97.41% White (96.69% non-Hispanic), 0.26% African American, 0.31% Native American or Alaska Native, 0.64% Asian, 0.26% from other races, and 1.11% from two or more races. No Pacific Islanders lived in the city in 2010. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1.19% of the population.\nThere were 3,093 households, out of which 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.3% were married couples living together, 16.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.2% had a male householder with no wife present, and 38.5% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27, and the average family size was 2.91.\nThe age distribution was 22.5% under 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 22.9% from 25 to 44, 25.3% from 45 to 64, and 20.8% who were 65 or older. The median age was 41.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 80.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.8 males.\nIncome data from the 2010 Census for Kentucky locations have not yet been released. As of the 2000 Census, the median income for a household in the city was $22,203. The median income for a family was $32,784. Males had a median income of $27,323 versus $17,568 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,200. About 15.5% of families and 21.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.0% of those under age 18 and 16.4% of those age 65 or over.\n\nEconomy\nInitially provided by L&N Railroad, rail transport was the backbone of the local economy in the first half of the 20th century. While the railroad (presently CSX) continues to play an important role, the decline of the rail industry in the latter half of the 20th century, as well as the loss of some manufacturing jobs, has prompted the community to begin diversifying its economy.\n\nCulture\nEach year in early August, Corbin hosts a festival called NIBROC (Corbin spelled backward) featuring open-air concerts, carnival attractions, a beauty pageant, parade, and other events. The festival is featured, if anachronistically, in the play Last Train to Nibroc by Arlene Hutton. (Though the play is set in the 1940s, the festival itself only dates to 1952.) NIBROC often features free performances by popular musical acts such as 38 Special, Foghat, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Kansas, The Marshall Tucker Band, Percy Sledge, Rick Springfield, Starship, Styx and The Turtles. In episode 10 of the American reality-documentary television series On the Road with Austin & Santino on Lifetime entitled \"We Love a Parade\", the fashion designers visit Corbin to custom-design a dress for a local woman participating in the NIBROC parade.\nDespite being in dry counties (Knox and Whitley), the city of Corbin allows full retail alcohol sales, following a successful local option election on February 14, 2012. The city had previously voted in 2004 to allow sales of alcohol by the drink in larger restaurants.Corbin has an association with Kentucky Fried Chicken, having been the location of the chain's first restaurant, opened in 1930. Corbin appears in the animated cartoon South Park's episode \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\", wherein Eric Cartman visits the town to meet with Harland Sanders. Corbin is depicted as located in a lush rain forest in a parody of the 1983 film Scarface, wherein Tony Montana and Omar Suarez visit Bolivia to meet with a drug kingpin.\n\nGovernment\nCorbin is governed by a mayor and city commission and a city manager who runs the departments' day-to-day operations. Currently, Marlon Sams is the city manager. Since it does not have a mayor\/alderman form of government, Corbin is considered home rule-class under Kentucky's city classification system that took effect in 2015. Susie Razmus is the current mayor. Trent Knuckles, David Grigsby Hart, Ed Tye, and Andrew Pennington are its four current commissioners.Corbin is one of the few cities in Kentucky that lie in two counties\u2014Whitley and Knox. Many built-up areas in neighboring Laurel County have a Corbin postal address but lie outside the city limits. This arrangement has created some problems with taxes and census records. The city receives a portion of the occupational tax collected in Whitley County. However, Knox County has refused to give Corbin any tax collected there. On March 10, 2008, the City Commission voted to file a lawsuit against Knox County to receive a portion of the tax collected within city limits. On May 23, 2014, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled that the \"Stivers amendment\", passed as part of KY HB 499 \"Tax Amnesty\" legislation in 2012, did not violate the state's constitution. The measure essentially canceled the effect of court rulings that would have enabled Corbin to keep all the revenue from the tax generated inside the city limits. Corbin's mayor, Willard McBurney, vowed to carry the fight to the state Supreme Court.Corbin is in Kentucky's 5th congressional district.\n\nEducation\nCorbin, like many communities of its size in southeastern Kentucky, has an independent school system (in Kentucky, a public school system not affiliated with a county; most such districts are associated with individual cities). The district was officially established in 1916, and the 100th class graduated in 2017. The Corbin Independent School District includes:\n\nCorbin Preschool Center\nCorbin Primary (grades K-3)\nCorbin Elementary (grades 4\u20135) (Currently housed by the newest building in the district after a complete remodeling of the former Middle School.\nCorbin Middle (grades 6\u20138)\nCorbin High (grades 9\u201312) (Currently housed by the oldest building in the district)\nCorbin School Of InnovationThe community and school system place considerable emphasis on the success of academics and high school athletic teams. Corbin \"Redhound\" sports are important social events within the community.\nIn 2004, Eastern Kentucky University opened an extension campus in Corbin.\nThe annual Battle for the Brass Lantern, a college football rivalry game between the University of the Cumberlands and Union College, was played at Corbin High School's stadium in 2006 and 2007, as a neutral field roughly equidistant from the two campuses. The rivalry dates to 1905.Corbin was formerly home to Saint Camillus Academy, a private pre-K-8 Catholic school affiliated with the Diocese of Lexington. Established in 1908 by the Sisters of Divine Providence, the school has been successful as both a boarding school for national and international students and as a Montessori school. Its original schoolhouse, built in 1913, was demolished in summer 2008. The new school building is still situated atop a prominent hill overlooking the town, providing a striking backdrop to the streets of downtown Corbin. The school closed in 2012 after 99 years of service. The property and grounds of the school were sold to the Corbin School System to house a new Corbin Middle School due to the rapidly increasing student population and age of the current building.\nCorbin has a lending library, the Corbin Public Library.\n\nTransportation\nCorbin straddles Interstate 75 and U.S. Highway 25 (which splits into US 25E and US 25W in North Corbin). The town is served by the CSX rail line.\n\nSites of interest\nCumberland Falls State Resort Park, the site of a waterfall, one of the few in the Western Hemisphere that regularly produces a moonbow, is 19 miles (31 km) to the southwest.\nHarland Sanders Caf\u00e9 and Museum, the birthplace of Kentucky Fried Chicken (though not sold as the KFC\/Kentucky Fried Chicken brand at the time), is located in North Corbin. The restaurant and accompanying museum are popular with tour groups traveling along Interstate 75.\nThe Arena at the Southeastern Kentucky Ag and Expo Complex, a multi-purpose venue on top of a hill across from the Baptist Regional Medical Center, sits above the Corbin Center. This multi-purpose education center also houses the Corbin Tourism office.\nNearby Laurel River Lake, created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1974, is a popular recreational site for boating, fishing, water skiing, and scuba diving.\nCumberland Gap and Cumberland Gap National Historical Park are about 50 miles (80 km) south of Corbin on U.S. Highway 25E at the Tennessee border.\n\nMedia\nNewspapers\nThe Times-Tribune, a Tuesday And Thursday newspaper\nNews Journal, weekly newspaper covering both Corbin (headquarters) and the Whitley County, Kentucky, area including Williamsburg\n\nRadio\nWCTT AM 680 (Great 68; Oldies)\nWKDP AM 1330\nWEKF FM 88.5 (Eastern Ky Univ. affiliate)\nWVCT FM 91.5 (Gospel Eagle; Southern Gospel)\nWKDP FM 99.5 (Country)\nWCTT FM 107.3 (T-107; Adult Contemporary)\nWRHR-LPFM 95.3 (also known as Corbin's Own Red 95.3; broadcast by Corbin High School)\n\nTV\nWVTN (Channel 22 Time Warner Cable) - religious; broadcast from Corbin with local and regional churches and religious syndicated programs part of the radio station WVCT 91.5\nRBS (Channel 18 Time Warner Cable) - Corbin school district information broadcasting the WRHR radio station Red 95.3\nYHC (Channel 21 on Time Warner Cable) - broadcasts local and regional business infomercials and runs on-screen ads playing Contemporary Christian Music\n\nNotable people\nRodger Bird, football player\nEnsley A.

It consists of a strong bladder (or plastic bag), usually made of several layers of metallised film or other plastics, seated inside a corrugated fiberboard box.\n\nFeatures\nThe bag is supplied to the company which will fill it as an empty pre-made bag. The company filling the bag with its product generally removes the tap, fills the bag (with wine, juice or other liquid) and replaces the tap and then the bag is placed in the box. \nThe bags are available as singles for semi-automatic machines or as web bags, where the bags have perforations between each one. These are used on automated filling systems where the bag is separated on line either before the bag is automatically filled or after. Depending on the end use, there are a number of options that can be used on the bag instead of the tap. The bags can be filled from chilled product temperatures up to 85 \u00b0C (185 \u00b0F).\nBiB packaging can be made using form seal fill (FSF) technology, where the bags are manufactured on-line from reels of film, then the FlexTap is inserted then filled on an integral rotary head filler. The BiB is currently used to package wine, soda fountain syrup products, milk, liquid chemicals, and water.\n\nHistory\nThe first commercial BiB system was invented by American chemist William R. Scholle in 1955 for the safe transportation and dispensing of battery acid. Scholle's invention inspired a \"packaging revolution.\" In 1991, Scholle was inducted into the packaging hall of fame for his invention.\n\nUses\nBiB has many common commercial applications. Among the most common ones are to supply syrup to soft drink fountains and to dispense bulk supplied condiments such as ketchup or mustard in the foodservice industry (especially in fast food outlets). BiB technology is still used for its original application of dispensing sulfuric acid for filling lead-acid batteries in garages and dealerships. As explained further below, BiBs have also been implemented for consumer applications like boxed wine.For commercial syrup applications, the customer opens one end of the box (sometimes via a pre-scored opening) and connects a compatible connector to a built-in port on the bag to pump out its contents. The port itself contains a one-way valve which opens only under pressure from the attached connector and which prevents contamination of the syrup in the bag. For consumer applications like boxed wine, there is a tap already present on the bag which protrudes through a pre-cut hole on the box, so all the consumer has to do is locate the tap on the outside of the box.\nProducers like BiB packaging because it is inexpensive. BiB also offers environmental benefits by allowing contents of 1.5\u20131000 liters, so that less packaging or labeling is required. The material it is made from is lighter than the other plastic alternatives, providing it with a better carbon footprint.\n\nWine cask\nThe 'wine cask' was invented by Thomas Angove (1918\u20132010) of Angove's, a winemaker from Renmark, South Australia, and patented by the company on April 20, 1965. Polyethylene bladders of 1 gallon (4.5 litres) were put into corrugated boxes for sale to consumers. An original design required that the consumer cut the corner off the bladder inside the box, pour out the desired quantity of wine and then reseal it with a special peg.In 1967, Charles Malpas and Penfolds Wines patented a plastic, air-tight tap welded into an aluminised film bladder, making storage much more convenient for consumers. All modern wine casks now utilise some sort of plastic tap, which is exposed by tearing away a perforated panel on the box.\nThe main advantage of BiB packaging is that it prevents oxidation of the wine during dispensing. Rather than working as a conventional tap, the bladder uses gravity pressure to squeeze the liquid out of the bladder, whereas a conventional barrel tap works by allowing incoming air to displace the contents. After opening wine in a bottle, it is oxidized by air in the bottle which has displaced the wine poured; wine in a bag is not touched by air and thus not subject to oxidation until it is dispensed. Cask wine is not subject to cork taint or spoilage due to slow consumption after opening.Although a promising technology, there have been production and design problems. The impermeable bladders tend to delaminate around the tap and where the two halves are joined. If tap components are deposited in the bladder during assembly, all the bladders must be destroyed to find the components as the bladders are opaque. It has also been difficult to manufacture taps that do not leak air into the bladder since tap parts usually do not join neatly, although there have been significant improvements. Most red wines require breathing before consumption which is not possible with casks, so the wine has air circulated through it before bottling (usually by running through a centrifuge), which reduces shelf life considerably. Most casks will have a best-before date stamped. As a result, it is not intended for cellaring and should be consumed within the prescribed period.\n\nAseptic packaging\nBiB is also used extensively in the packaging of processed fruit and dairy products in aseptic processes. Using aseptic packaging equipment, products can be packed in aseptic packaging. Pasteurized or UHT treated products packed into this format can be \"shelf-stable\", requiring no refrigeration. Some products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years, depending on the type of bag that is used.\nThe key to this unique system is that the product being filled is not exposed to the external environment at any stage during the process and as such, there is no possibility of a bacterial load being added to the product during the filling process. To ensure there is no contamination from the packaging, the bag is irradiated after the bag manufacturing process.\nThese packs are typically from 10 to 1200 liters and offer the advantage of cheap, disposable and transport efficient packaging.\n\nSee also\nCorrugated box design\nTetra Brik\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nBagman (disambiguation)\nA bagman or bag man is a collector of dirty money for organized crime.\nBagman may also refer to:\n\nBagman (video game), a 1982 French platform arcade game\nBagman, a biochip containing the personality of a fallen comrade in the 2000AD comic Rogue Trooper\nBagman (film), a 2010 film about Jack Abramoff\nSack Man or Bag Man, a bogeyman-figure\nLudo Bagman, a character in J.

The film premiered on February 28, 2014, in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nPlot\nBrutal gangster Dragna recruits professional killer Jack to pick up a bag and wait for his arrival at a motel.  Dragna stresses that Jack is not to open the bag or allow anyone to view its contents under any circumstances.  Confused as to why Dragna wants him to do such an apparently easy job, Jack presses for more details, but Dragna only reiterates the rules.  When Jack acquires the bag and a henchman of Dragna's shoots him in the hand, Jack kills him and stuffs the body in his car's trunk.  Dragna is unsympathetic when Jack calls him and instructs Jack to stick to the plan.\nAt the motel, Jack meets several people: Ned, the desk clerk who uses a wheelchair; Rivka, a tall hooker; and Lizard and Guano, a pair of pimps. Jack requests room number thirteen, and Ned cautions him that it is a deathtrap, as it is unconnected.  When two suited men become curious about Jack, he abruptly breaks into their room and kills both. A subsequent search reveals FBI badges and a briefcase. Jack sets the briefcase aside and leaves to dump the corpse stored in his car, but promptly returns upon being spotted, only to discover that Rivka has broken into his room. Fearful that Lizard will kill her, she requests that he allow her to stay.\nJack initially demands that she leave, then detains her when he cannot be sure whether she opened the bag. Rivka points out that the briefcase contains a photo of the bag, and Jack becomes worried that others may attempt to acquire it. When Jack attempts to drive Rivka to a bus station, she spots the corpse in the back of his car. Lizard and Guano first question Jack about Rivka and later, on the road, attack him. On their corpses he finds another photo of the bag. Unsure what to do with Rivka, or of her involvement, he returns to the hotel with her to await Dragna's arrival.\nNed becomes suspicious that Jack has a guest in his room and calls the sheriff when Jack refuses to pay the double occupancy fee. Sheriff Larson briefly questions Jack, and, after Larson leaves, Jack threatens Ned. Increasingly worried about the safety of the bag, Jack buries it near the motel, only to be caught by Ned, who is now out of his wheelchair. Jack kills Ned and returns to the motel, where Larson arrests him under suspicion of Ned's disappearance.\nAs Larson prepares to torture Jack for information, Rivka shows up. Larson threatens to rape her, but she overpowers a deputy and frees Jack, who then kills Larson. When Rivka demonstrates detailed knowledge of the bag, Jack becomes suspicious of her again, but she points out that she has saved his life.  Somewhat mollified, he retrieves the bag and waits in room fourteen. Dragna finally appears, disappointed in Jack's apparent lack of trust. Nonetheless satisfied that Jack has not looked in the bag, Dragna explains that the whole situation was a test of Jack's skills and character, as he doubted Jack's resolve in the wake of Jack's fiancee's unsolved murder some months earlier. The motel and the local cops are all on Dragna's payroll, and were all (unwittingly) part of the test.\nAs Dragna prepares to leave, Rivka spontaneously tells Jack that she looked in the bag. Frustrated, Jack points out that Dragna will now kill them both. Jack dutifully reports Rivka's action to Dragna, who orders her killed. Jack instead kills Dragna's bodyguard, who wounds Rivka. Jack hunts down Dragna, and both are wounded. Jack looks in the bag and discovers the head of his fiancee, whom Dragna had killed in order to prevent Jack from quitting the murder-for-hire business. Trying to persuade Jack to surrender, Dragna destroys the hotel (where Rivka supposedly is) with remote-detonated explosives. Moments later, Rivka appears and saves Jack by killing Dragna, but she is shot again. Later, in Dragna's lawyer's office, Rivka reveals herself as Dragna's mistress and personal assassin who was sent to the motel to ensure things went Dragna's way. She collects a five million dollar reward for Jack's assassination, and she and Jack drive off together.\n\nCast\nJohn Cusack as Jack\nRebecca Da Costa as Rivka\nRobert De Niro as Dragna\nCrispin Glover as Ned Stensen\nDominic Purcell as Sheriff Larson\nSticky Fingaz as Lizard\nMartin Klebba as Guano\nTheodus Crane as Goose\nDavid Shumbris as Pike\nMike Mayhall as Deputy Jones\nDanny Cosmo as Bishop\nDavid Grovic as Dragna's lawyer\n\nReception\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 10% of 42 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 3.4\/10.  Metacritic rated it 28\/100 based on 18 reviews.  Scott Foundas of Variety called it \"a tedious, self-consciously quirky postmodern noir\".  Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"If it weren't for the touches of cruelty, this might have been a passable B-movie, but Bag Man ends up wasting the A-list talent caught up in the lurid exercise.\"  Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the plot as \"a protracted and increasingly tedious cat-and-mouse game\" that \"pathetically tries to build up expectations about what might be in the bag\".  Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club called it a Quentin Tarantino knock-off made two decades too late.\nPassage 8:\nUna prostituta al servizio del pubblico e in regola con le leggi dello stato\nUna prostituta al servizio del pubblico e in regola con le leggi dello stato (literally \"A prostitute serving the public and complying with the laws of the state\", also known as Prostitution Italian Style) is a 1970  Italian comedy-drama film written and directed by Italo Zingarelli.For her performance Giovanna Ralli won the Grolla d'oro for best actress.\n\nCast\nGiovanna Ralli: Oslavia\nGiancarlo Giannini: Walter\nJean-Marc Bory: Fran\u00e7ois Coly\nDenise Bataille\nPaolo Bonacelli\nRoberto Chevalier\nPassage 9:\nThe Man with the Bag\n\"The Man with the Bag\" may refer to:\n\nThe Sack Man, a mythical figure\n\"(Everybody's Waitin' for) The Man with the Bag\", a Christmas song\n\"The Man with the Bag\", an episode of Ally McBeal\nPassage 10:\nThe Police Serve the Citizens?\nLa polizia \u00e8 al servizio del cittadino?

{"context":"Passage 1:\nGino Bartali\nGino Bartali,  (Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0no \u02c8bartali]; 18 July 1914 \u2013 5 May 2000), nicknamed Gino the Pious and (in Italy) Ginettaccio, was a champion road cyclist. He was the most renowned Italian cyclist before the Second World War, having won the Giro d'Italia twice, in 1936 and 1937, and the Tour de France in 1938. After the war, he added one more victory in each event: the Giro d'Italia in 1946 and the Tour de France in 1948. His second and last Tour de France victory in 1948 gave him the largest gap between victories in the race.In September 2013, 13 years after his death, Bartali was recognised as a \"Righteous Among the Nations\" by Yad Vashem for his efforts to aid Jews during World War II.\n\nEarly life and amateur career\nGino Bartali was born in Ponte a Ema, Florence, Italy, the third son of four children of a smallholder, Torello Bartali. He was powerfully built, with a broad nose and a boxer's face. He earned pocket money by selling raffia to makers of covers for wine bottles. He began work in a bicycle shop when he was 13. He started racing at 13, became a promising amateur and turned professional in 1935 when he was 21. He was Italian champion the next year. On 14 November 1940, Bartali married Adriana Bani in Florence. The wedding was celebrated by Cardinal Dalla Costa and was blessed by Pope Pius XII, to whom Bartali donated a bicycle.\n\nProfessional career\nBartali won a stage of the 1935 Giro d'Italia and was King of the Mountains, the first of seven times he won the title in the Giro. He was 20. In 1936, before he turned 22, he won the Giro and the Giro di Lombardia, although his season was marred when his brother, Giulio, died in a racing accident on 14 June. Bartali came close to giving up cycling.\nHe was persuaded to return and in 1937 won the Giro again. His reputation outside Italy was that he was yet another Italian who could not ride well outside his country. There was some truth in the claim. The writer Tim Hilton said: \"Bartali was essentially an Italian cyclist, a champion who rode within sight of his own people, and was uneasy when the Tour de France travelled north of Paris. He never disputed the northern classics.\"Stung by the claim, he rode the Tour de France in 1937. He got off to a bad start, losing more than eight minutes by the third stage and more than ten by the Ballon d'Alsace, a mountain in the Vosges. There he came back to life and led by 1m 14s over the rest and by enough over the leaders that he took the leader's jersey that night in Grenoble. But that was the end of his race. He and two helpers, Jules Rossi and Francesco Camusso, were riding across a wooden bridge over the river Colau when Rossi skidded. Bartali rode into a parapet and fell into the river.\nRoger Lap\u00e9bie wrote: \"In the valley that leads to Brian\u00e7on, I saw the accident to the maillot jaune, Bartali. The narrow and bumpy road ran along the foot of a rock. Suddenly Rossi, who was leading, took a bend badly, braked and his back wheel hit the parapet of a bridge. Bartali, who was beside Rossi, couldn't get clear and I saw him fall over the bridge and into the little river three metres below.\" Camusso pulled him out. Bartali was cut to his arm and knee and had trouble breathing because of a blow to the chest. He rode on to the end of the day, often pushed by his helpers. He finished 10 minutes behind the rest but kept his lead.\nHe got through the Alps, by then having lost his jersey, and retired in Marseille. In one account, before he dropped out, he notified the organiser, Henri Desgrange, who said: \"You are the first rider to come to see me before dropping out. You're a good man [un brave gar\u00e7on], Gino. We'll see each other again next year and you'll win.\" However, Bartali later claimed that the Italian Cycling Federation forced him to withdraw, perhaps because of his political opposition to Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. \u201cWhen the doctor didn\u2019t want me to race, \u2018they\u2019 made me race; when I should have withdrawn, they made me continue; when, after the four difficult stages, I was getting better, they sent me home,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did return in 1938 and overcame the teamwork of the Belgians, the cold and rain and a puncture on the Col de l'Iseran. He won the hardest stage, from Digne to Brian\u00e7on, by more than five minutes. The radio commentator Georges Briquet, after he had seen the crowds of Italians greeting Bartali with green-white-red flags said: \"These people had found a superman. Outside Bartali's hotel at Aix-les-Bains, an Italian general was shouting 'Don't touch him \u2013 he's a god.'\" A public subscription was started in his name in Italy, and Benito Mussolini was among the contributors.\nThe approaching war led Italy not to send a team in 1939.\n\nBartali won the Giro d'Italia twice before the war \u2013 in 1936 and 1937 \u2013 and once after it (1946). He won classics such as Milan\u2013San Remo, the Giro di Lombardia and the Z\u00fcri-Metzgete. His most famous victory was the 1948 Tour de France.\n\n1948: Second Tour\nBartali returned to the Tour in 1948 to find that many riders he had known had died in the war and that there were as many more who had started racing since he stopped (see below for Bartali's war record). He was so worried that he spent an evening memorising two dozen riders he did not know. The Tour started in a rainstorm and Bartali found he could identify nobody because the whole field was wearing waterproofs. He took his chance and found he was with Briek Schotte. The two finished together at Trouville, and Bartali took the yellow jersey.It was during that Tour that the leader of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, was shot in the neck by a sniper as he was leaving the parliament building. The writer Bernard Chambaz said:\n\nHistory and myth united, and a miracle if you like because that evening Bartali got a phone call at his hotel. In a bad mood, dubious, he didn't want to answer. But someone whispered that it was Alcide de Gasperi, his old friend from Catholic Action, now parliamentary president, who told him that Palmiro Togliatti, secretary-general of the communist party, had been shot at and had survived by a miracle. The situation in the peninsula was very tense amid the ravages of the Cold War. Italy needed Bartali to do what he best knew how to do, to win stages.\n\nThe communists occupied factories and radio and television stations, and angry rows in parliament came close to blows. A revolt was looming. Then Bartali won three stages in a row and led the Tour by 14 minutes. An obituary says:\n\nJust as it seemed the communists would stage a full-scale revolt, a deputy ran into the chamber shouting 'Bartali's won the Tour de France!' All differences were at once forgotten as the feuding politicians applauded and congratulated each other on a cause for such national pride. That day, with immaculate timing, Togliatti awoke from his coma on his hospital bed, inquired how the Tour was going and recommended calm. All over the country political animosities were for the time being swept aside by the celebrations and a looming crisis was averted.\n\nThe former prime minister, Giulio Andreotti said: \"To say that civil war was averted by a Tour de France victory is surely excessive. But it is undeniable that on that 14th of July of 1948, day of the attack on Togliatti, Bartali contributed to easing the tensions.\"\n\n1950: Tour de France\nGino Bartali had a row during the 1950 Tour de France with the French rider Jean Robic. Newspapers made much of it, and the atmosphere was tense. Robic got clear of Bartali on the col d'Aubisque in the Pyrenees. Bartali made up ground over the Tourmalet, took the descent to Sainte-Marie-de-Campan and started up the col d'Aspin. There he caught Robic and the two rode together. The two rubbed shoulders and they fell.\nBartali said French fans by the road were so angry, accusing him of sabotaging Robic's chances, that they punched him and that one threatened him with a knife. Bartali remounted and won the stage. Fiorenzo Magni, leading the Italian 'B' team, the Cadetti, took the yellow jersey. The pair and their teams had barely returned to their hotel when Bartali said he was going home and so, he said, were the two Italian teams.The organisers, Jacques Goddet and F\u00e9lix L\u00e9vitan, went to his hotel, the H\u00f4tel de France, in Lourdes, to dissuade him. Bartali, a cigarette in his mouth, said, \"I have no intention of risking my life to a madman.\" The truth of what happened may never be known: Louison Bobet, who saw the incident on the mountain, said: \"I'm pretty sure that in the time it took me to pass him, Bartali wasn't struck, and I think he mistook as blows what was an attempt to get him back in the saddle. A hunt started for the knifeman but all spectators could remember was that a man who had been slicing salami still had his knife in his hand when he went to help.\"It then emerged that the Italian teams had been withdrawn by the Italian cycling association. Italian fans grew so angry that a stage due to cross the border to San Remo stopped just short of the Italian border instead, at Menton.The affair escalated to the national level when the French foreign minister, Robert Schuman, apologised to his Italian counterpart for what seemed to be no more than a man interrupted in the making of a sandwich. Ren\u00e9 de Latour said:\n\nTo say that Magni was sore is putting it very mildly indeed. When he spoke to men he could trust, he would say: 'Gino knows what his little game is. He is too clever to ignore the facts that he will be lucky to win this Tour, and he prefers a foreign team win rather than see one of our team succeed, especially me. It was bad enough for him with Coppi winning last year.\n\nRescues and Resistance role during World War II\nBartali earned respect for his work in helping Jews who were being persecuted by the Nazis during the time of the Italian Social Republic. He appears as a character in the 1978 novel, The Assisi Underground: The Priest who Rescued Jews, and in the 1985 American television film adaptation, both based on the real-life account by Father Rufino Niccacci.\nIt emerged in December 2010 that Bartali had hidden a Jewish family in his cellar and, according to one of the survivors, saved their lives in doing so.Bartali used his fame to carry messages and documents to the Italian Resistance. Bartali cycled from Florence through Tuscany, Umbria, and Marche, many times traveling as far afield as Assisi, all the while wearing the racing jersey emblazoned with his name.\nNeither the Fascist police nor the German troops risked discontent by arresting him.\nGiorgio Nissim, a Jewish accountant from Pisa, was a member of DELASEM, founded by the Union of the Israelitic Communities to help Jewish Italians escape persecution. The network in Tuscany was discovered in autumn 1943 and all Jewish members except Nissim sent to concentration camps. With the help of the Archbishops of Genoa Pietro Boetto and Florence Elia Dalla Costa, the Franciscan Friars of Assisi and others, Nissim reorganized DELASEM in Tuscany and helped 800 survive.\nNissim died in 2000. His sons found from his diaries that Bartali had used his fame to help. Nissim and the Oblati Friars of Lucca forged documents and needed photographs of those they were helping. Bartali used to leave Florence in the morning, pretending to train, ride to Assisi where many Jews were hiding in the Franciscan convents, collect their photographs and ride back to Nissim. At Assisi Bartali was in direct contact with Rufino Niccacci. Bartali also used his position to learn about raids on safehouses.\nBartali was eventually taken to Villa Triste in Florence. The SD and the Italian RSS official Mario Carit\u00e0 questioned Bartali, threatening his life. In spite of any threats, Bartali did not reveal what he had done. Even after the war he never boasted his merits; he used to say: \"The good is done, but it is not said. And certain medals hang on the soul, not on the jacket.\"Bartali continued working with the Assisi Network. In 1943, he led Jewish refugees towards the Swiss Alps himself. He cycled, pulling a wagon with a secret compartment, telling patrols it was just part of his training. Bartali told his son Andrea only that \"One does these things and then that's that\".In June 2012, a book about Bartali's wartime activities, Road To Valor by Aili and Andres McConnon, was published.In 2013, Yad Vashem awarded Gino Bartali the honour Righteous Among the Nations. He is a central figure in the 2014 documentary My Italian Secret: The Forgotten Heroes. In 2007, the script for a movie based on Bartali during World War II, called Lion Man of Tuscany was on the Black List, a survey of the \"most liked\" un-produced scripts in Hollywood.In 2017, research by Michele Sarfatti questioned Bartali's efforts to save Jewish lives, referring to the very limited sources and contradicting that Bartali would have described this in his diaries. In 2021, Marco and Stefano Pivato corroborated this stance by Sarfatti, calling the whole story 'invented' ('una storia inventata'). In 2021, an interview with Sergio Della Pergola, an Israeli-Italian academic who was involved in Yad Vashem\u2019s investigation of Bartali\u2019s role during the war, was published in the Corriere della Sera. Outlining some of the evidence regarding Bartali\u2019s efforts during the war, he disagreed with the argument put forth by Sarfatti and Marco and Stefano Pivato. He was quoted as saying: \u201cTo question whether Gino Bartali risked his life to save Jews is like denying that the Earth is round.\u201d\n\nRiding style and legacy\nBartali was a good climber and a pioneer of derailleur gears. His style was unusual: he rarely danced on the pedals and often stayed in the saddle throughout a 15 km climb. When others attacked, he stayed in the saddle but changed up a gear, to a sprocket three teeth smaller.He rode smoothly on mountains but every now and then freewheeled, always with his right foot lowered with his weight on it. Then a second or two later he would start pedalling again.Bartali's feat of winning three consecutive mountain stages (13, 14 and 15) in the 1948 Tour de France has never been equalled. It is one of the most astonishing accomplishments in the history of road cycling. It would be 50 years before anyone again won three consecutive stages, when Italian cyclist Mario Cipollini did so in the early (flat) stages of the 1999 Tour de France, winning four consecutive sprint finishes in stages 4, 5, 6 and 7.\n\nRivalry with Coppi\nBartali's rivalry with Fausto Coppi divided Italy. Bartali, a conservative, was venerated in the rural, agrarian south, while Coppi, more worldly, secular, innovative in diet and training, was a hero of the industrial north.\nThe lives of each came together on 7 January 1940 when Eberrardo Pavesi, head of the Legnano team, took on Coppi to ride for Bartali. Bartali thought Coppi was \"as thin as a mutton bone\", but accepted. Their rivalry started when Coppi, the helper, won the Giro and Bartali, the star, marshalled the two men's team to chase him. By the 1948 world championship at Valkenburg, both climbed off rather than help the other win. The Italian cycling association said: \"They have forgotten to honour the Italian prestige they represent. Thinking only of their personal rivalry, they abandoned the race, to the approbation of all sportsmen.\" They were suspended for two months.The thaw partly broke when the pair shared a drink bottle during the climb of the Col d'Izoard in the 1952 Tour but the two men fell out over who had offered it. \"I did,\" Bartali insisted. \"He never gave me anything.\" Their rivalry was the subject of intense coverage and resulted in many epic races.\nWhen professional cycle racing resumed in 1946 after World War II, Bartali narrowly beat Coppi in that year's Giro, while Coppi won Milan\u2013San Remo. Bartali won the Tour de Suisse twice, another Milan\u2013San Remo, and the 1948 Tour de France \u2013 a full ten years after his last victory. Coppi took victories in the 1947 Giro d'Italia, the Giro di Lombardia and the Grand Prix des Nations.\nDespite the rivalry, perhaps heightened by Coppi's victory in the 1949 Giro, Bartali supported Coppi's bid in the 1949 Tour de France. The two Italian teammates destroyed the race as a contest in a mountainous Alpine stage over the Col de Vars and Col d'Izoard. When Coppi had a puncture on the Izoard, Bartali waited for him, then Bartali did the same and Coppi waited. On the final climb to Brian\u00e7on, Coppi allowed Bartali to win (on his 35th birthday) and take the yellow jersey. But Coppi assumed the maillot jaune the following day after Bartali had a puncture with 40 km of the stage still to race. Coppi retained the lead to Paris, while Bartali took second place.\nThe 1950 Tour de France saw him lead the Italian team again, with Coppi electing not to contest the race, but having been threatened by frenzied fans, the entire Italian team resigned from the race.\nBartali always suspected that Coppi took drugs. On the hairpins of the Col di Bracco, during a stage of the 1946 Giro from Genoa to Montecatini Terme, Coppi drank from a glass phial and threw it into the verge. Bartali drove back after the race and found it. He said:\n\nWith the meticulous care of a detective collecting evidence for fingerprinting I picked it up, dropped it into a white envelope and put it carefully in my pocket. The next day I rushed round to my personal doctor and asked him to send the phial to a lab for analysis. Disappointment: no drug, no magic potion. It was nothing more than an ordinary tonic, made in France, that I could have bought without a prescription.\n\nI realised that I should have to try to outsmart him and I devised my own investigation system. The first thing was to make sure I always stayed at the same hotel for a race and to have the room next to his so I could mount surveillance. I would watch him leave with his mates, then I would tiptoe into the room which ten seconds earlier had been his headquarters. I would rush to the waste bin and the bedside table, go through the bottles, flasks, phials, tubes, cartons, boxes, suppositories \u2013 I swept up everything. I had become so expert in interpreting all these pharmaceuticals that I could predict how Fausto would behave during the course of the stage. I would work out, according to the traces of the product I found, how and when he would attack me.\n\nPersonal life\nBartali grew up in a religious family in Tuscany, and his belief earned him the nickname \"Gino the Pious\". He prayed before meals and resented when teammates swore. In contrast, Coppi grew up in Piedmont in the north and was not religious at all. Bartali was proud that Pope John XXIII had asked him to teach him to ride a bicycle. He made no secret that he supported the Catholic-leaning Christian Democratic Party but his personality ensured that he was forgiven by the rival communists. Tim Hilton wrote: \"Bartali was a genuinely religious man, making his devotions public and, in return, becoming the Vatican's favourite sportsman \u2013 he was personally blessed by three popes. He would set up shrines in his hotel bedrooms when he rode the Giro and the Tour de France, and, on some mountains, children from summer camps sang canticles as he pedalled past, a priest conducting their infant worship.\"Bartali was frequently pessimistic. One of his customary phrases was \"Everything's wrong; we'll have to start all over again.\" The best the historian Pierre Chany could say of him was that while he often boasted of what he had done on mountains when nobody was there to see him, he had the grace never to tell the story differently.\nBartali lived at 173 via Chiantigiana, Florence in a home full of souvenirs. His wife died in 2014 aged 94.\n\nLater life and death\nBartali stopped racing when he was 40, after being injured in a road accident. By then he had lost much of his money. His wealth was \"uncertain\", said Ren\u00e9 de Latour.Bartali had a heart bypass operation and then died of a heart attack in May 2000, having received the last rites 10 days earlier. He left behind his wife, Adriana, two sons and a daughter. The prime minister, Giuliano Amato, sent condolences. Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, called him \"a symbol of the most noble sportsmanship.\" The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) called for two days of mourning and silence was observed before sports events.\n\nCareer achievements\nMajor results\nSources:\n\nGrand Tour results timeline\nSources:\n\nMonuments results timeline\nSources:\n\nSee also\nLegends of Italian sport - Walk of Fame\n69500 Ginobartali, asteroid\nCycling records\nYellow jersey statistics\nPink jersey statistics\nList of Grand Tour general classification winners\nList of Tour de France general classification winners\nList of Tour de France secondary classification winners\nList of Giro d'Italia general classification winners\nIndividuals and groups assisting Jews during the Holocaust\nList of Righteous Among the Nations by country\nHistory of the Jews in Italy\nList of Italians\nPassage 2:\nTiberius Coruncanius\nTiberius Coruncanius (died 241 BC) was a consul of the Roman Republic in 280 BC. As a military commander in that year and the following, he was known for the battles against Pyrrhus of Epirus that led to the expression \"Pyrrhic victory\". He was the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus, and possibly the first teacher of Roman law to offer public instruction.\n\nBiography\nCoruncanius, of plebeian descent, is believed to have hailed from Tusculum.He was first elected consul in 280 BC with Publius Valerius Laevinus, and led an expedition into Etruria against the Etruscan cities.  When Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Italia, and defeated the Roman legions of Laevinus at the Battle of Heraclea, Tiberius' legions were recalled to Rome to bolster the defense of Roman territory.\nIn 254 BC or 253 BC, he was the first plebeian elected Pontifex Maximus, or chief priest of the Roman Republic, which position had been previously monopolized by patricians. He died in 241 BC and was succeeded by Lucius Caecilius Metellus, another plebeian.\n\nImpact\nHe was the first who publicly professed law (publice professus est), known to be both eloquent and full of knowledge. Like Socrates, he left no writings.\nHis public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (jurisprudentes), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius' death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts.It is possible that as the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus, Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students of the law of Ancient Rome to attend his consultations tasked with giving legal advice to citizens. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested. As such, he became the first teacher of Roman law (how students of law learned their material earlier is unknown).\nPassage 3:\nBattle of Bassano\nThe Battle of Bassano was fought on 8 September 1796, during the French Revolutionary Wars, in the territory of the Republic of Venice, between a French army under Napoleon Bonaparte and Austrian forces led by Count Dagobert von Wurmser. The engagement occurred during the second Austrian attempt to raise the siege of Mantua. It was a French victory; however, it was the last battle in Napoleon's perfect military career as two months later he would be defeated at the Second Battle of Bassano, ending his victorious streak. The Austrians abandoned their artillery and baggage, losing supplies, cannons, and battle standards to the French.\n\nBackground\nAustrian plans\nThe first relief of Mantua failed at the battles of Lonato and Castiglione in early August. The defeat caused Wurmser to retreat north up the Adige River valley. Meanwhile, the French reinvested the Austrian garrison of Mantua.\nOrdered by Emperor Francis II to relieve Mantua at once, Feldmarschall Wurmser and his new chief-of-staff Feldmarschal-Leutnant (FML) Franz von Lauer drew up a strategy. Leaving FML Paul Davidovich and 13,700 soldiers to defend Trento and the approaches to the County of Tyrol, Wurmser directed two divisions east then south down the Brenta valley. When he joined the large division of Johann M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros at Bassano, he would have 20,000 men. From Bassano, Wurmser would move on Mantua, while Davidovich probed the enemy defenses from the north, looking for a favorable opportunity to support his superior. Lauer predicted that the French, having suffered recent losses, would be unable to react in time. Unknown to the Austrians, the French government desired that General Bonaparte cross the Alps to join the army of General Jean Moreau in southern Germany.\n\nForces\nSee Bassano 1796 Campaign Order of Battle for a list of French and Austrian army units.\n\nGeography\nIn 1796, there were only three practicable routes between Trento and the Po River basin. The first route lay west of Lake Garda. The second route was the road down the Adige valley east of Lake Garda and north of Verona. The third route went east through Levico Terme and Borgo Valsugana, then followed the Brenta River valley (Valsugana) southward to Bassano del Grappa. An army that held both Trento and Bassano could move troops and supplies between the two places free from French interference.\n\nOperations\nBonaparte posted General of Division Claude Vaubois with 10,000 men on the west side of Lake Garda. General of Division Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na defended the Adige River valley with 13,000 troops and General of Division Pierre Augereau covered Verona with 10,000 more. General of Division Charles Kilmaine maintained the blockade of Mantua with General of Division Jean Sahuguet's division of 8,000 soldiers and held a 2,000 man reserve at Verona. Another source gave Vaubois 11,000, Massena 13,000, Augereau 9,000, Sahuguet 10,000, and Kilmaine 3,500 soldiers.After Castiglione, Bonaparte had rearranged his intelligence gathering: the French representative in Venice, Lallement, was sent money to pay for spies to check out the areas between Venice and Trent  and Bonaparte's station chief, Angelo Pico, based at Peschiera, sent his men forward into the Tyrol. More importantly, his spy Francesco Toli had penetrated Austrian headquarters and forewarned Bonaparte that Wurmser had left Davidovich at Trento. So, Bonaparte struck first, sending Mass\u00e9na and Augereau north toward Trento. Meanwhile, Vaubois advanced past Lake Idro to Riva at the north end of Lake Garda. Vaubois and Mass\u00e9na converged on Rovereto on the Adige. At the Battle of Rovereto on 4 September, the French routed Davidovich's outnumbered troops, inflicting 3,000 casualties at a cost of 750 killed and wounded.Finding that Wurmser had moved toward Bassano, Bonaparte abandoned the plan to link with Moreau. Leaving Vaubois to observe the fleeing Austrians in the upper Adige valley, the French army commander decided to take a bold but risky course of action. Cutting loose from his supply line, he ordered Augereau, followed by Mass\u00e9na, to the east into the Brenta valley. On 7 September, Augereau's 8,200 soldiers overwhelmed the 2,800 to 4,000 Austrians of Wurmser's rear guard at Primolano (6 km north of Cismon del Grappa), capturing 1,500 men and their commander Oberstleutnant Alois von Gavasini. The victorious French then followed the valley as it turned south toward Bassano.\n\nBattle\nBassano\nDespite being surprised by the French rapid advance, Wurmser had gathered up 20,000 men the day before the collision took place.\nOn 8 September, 20,000 French soldiers fell upon Wurmser from the north. First, they attacked the 3,800-man Austrian rearguard under FML Peter Quasdanovich and General-Major (GM) Adam Bajalics. Bonaparte sent Mass\u00e9na down the west bank of the Brenta and Augereau down the east bank. Overwhelmed by repeated attacks and pursued by Colonel Joachim Murat's cavalry, the rearguard collapsed and Bajalics was captured. Wurmser deployed one brigade on the west bank, a second brigade on the east bank, and a third in Bassano. Colonel Jean Lannes led a successful charge which broke the Austrian lines and burst into the town. Quasdanovich later assumed command over the defeated Austrians who retreated east, but 3,500 soldiers of FML Karl Sebottendorf's division fell back to the south with their army commander.\nThe French suffered 400 killed, wounded, and missing. Wurmser lost 600 killed and wounded. Between 2,000 and 6,000 Austrians, eight colors and 30 artillery pieces were captured. The vigorous French pursuit also seized a bridging train plus 200 limbers and ammunition wagons.\n\nRace for Mantua\nWurmser unexpectedly headed west toward Mantua and joined the division of M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros at Vicenza. Immediately, Bonaparte sent his two divisions after the Austrians, hoping to cut them off. Mass\u00e9na advanced southwest from Vicenza while Augereau moved south to Padua to close the Austrian escape route to the east. General-Major Peter Ott distinguished himself by leading Wurmser's vanguard in the race for Mantua. A French battalion holding Legnago abandoned its post, allowing the Austrians passage across the Adige. Wurmser left 1,600 men to hold the city and continued his march. On 11 September, Mass\u00e9na intercepted the Austrians at Cerea with two brigades weakened by straggling. Ott held on until Wurmser arrived with the main body, driving the French back with 1,200 casualties. Bonaparte ordered Sahuguet to take up blocking positions at Castel d'Ario and at Governolo where the Mincio River flowed into the Po River. The next day, the Austrian field marshal, assisted by a local guide, crossed a bridge that Sahuguet failed to destroy and led 10,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry to Mantua.After capturing the detachment at Legnago on 13 September, Bonaparte appeared before Mantua. On 15 September, Wurmser awaited the French on the east bank of the Mincio River in line of battle, with his right flank on the San Giorgio suburb and his left on La Favorita Palace. The Austrian left wing under Ott held off Sahuguet's attacks all day. But the Austrian line gave way before the attacks of Mass\u00e9na on the center and General of Brigade Louis Andr\u00e9 Bon (leading Augereau's division) on the right. The French succeeded in capturing the San Giorgio suburb and driving the Austrians into Mantua. During this fight, 2,500 Austrians became casualties and 11 cannon and 3 colors were captured. The French lost 1,500 killed and wounded, plus nine guns captured.\n\nResults\nMantua's garrison was swollen to nearly 30,000 men. But, within six weeks, 4,000 Austrians died of wounds or disease in the crowded fortress. One historian notes that,\n\nThe second attempt to relieve Mantua had therefore come to a rather sorry conclusion for the Austrians. Their army commander had managed to get himself shut inside the very place he was trying to liberate, losing more than 11,000 men in the process. The French had failed to make the link between their armies in Italy and Germany, and Bonaparte was, in a sense, back to square one, still faced with the problem of reducing Mantua, which now had a much more powerful garrison.\n\nFootnotes\nPassage 4:\nBattle of the Slaak\nThe naval Battle of the Slaak (12 and 13 September 1631) was a Dutch victory during the Eighty Years' War. The Dutch prevented the Spanish army from dividing the Dutch United Provinces in two.\n\nBackground\nIn reaction to an overland Dutch attempt to capture Dunkirk earlier in the year, Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, governing the Southern Netherlands for Philip IV of Spain, ordered a Spanish army transported on a fleet of barges to attempt to occupy the islands of Goeree and Overflakee by surprise.  In particular, the Spanish wished to overpower the large fortresses on either side of the Volkerak Strait.  The fortress on the continental side had special propaganda value, as it was a newly founded town named Willemstad after William the Silent; more importantly, Spanish occupation would have allowed a blockade of the Dutch main naval port Hellevoetsluis located to the direct north of Overflakee on the island of Voorne; and the isolation of the province of Zealand from its confederate provinces.\n\nThe battle\nA Spanish fleet of ninety vessels and 5,500 men under the direction of Don Francisco de Moncada, Marquis of Aytona, but in fact commanded by Count Jan van Nassau Siegen, a catholic cousin of the Calvinist Dutch House of Orange, mostly consisting of small transports, departed from Antwerp.\nThe project could not be kept a secret however and a Dutch task force of fifty ships, also largely consisting of small rivercraft but containing some larger flyboats, under Zealandic Vice-Admiral Marinus Hollare, intercepted the fleet in the Eastern Scheldt. Seeing their intended route blocked, the Spanish first tried to capture the more southern island of Tholen instead, to show something for their efforts, but this attempt was thwarted by a regiment of two thousand English and Scots mercenaries under the command of Colonel Thomas Morgan from the continental fortress of Steenbergen who marched at low tide through the shallow sea to the island, arriving just in time to deter a landing. Van Nassau in his desperation then took the bold decision to attempt to sneak past the Dutch fleet during the night and so achieve the original goal after all.\nThe Spanish movement however was noticed despite a fog; despite their small number the Dutch first allowed the enemy fleet to pass completely before cutting them off. Once this was achieved the Dutch suddenly attacked the Spanish from behind in the Slaak of Volkerak channel and were routed. Hundreds drowned as they tried to escape the ships and those that did escape were captured by the waiting Dutch and English troops ashore. Over 4,000 troops and seamen were captured along with the majority of ships. Van Nassau himself and two ships accompanying him managed to escape to Antwerp; it is not exactly known how many others escaped, perhaps as much as a third of his fleet.\n\nAftermath\nThe Admiralty of Amsterdam suggested throwing all prisoners into the sea \u2014 until that time the officially prescribed method for the Dutch to dispense with enemy combatants captured at sea \u2014 to deter further attempts, but stadtholder Frederick Henry of Orange forbade this. One of the captains distinguishing himself was the later Lieutenant-Admiral Johan Evertsen, his brother the later Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Evertsen de Oude also participated. The defeat was one out of a series of setbacks for the Habsburg policy in the Thirty Years War waged the same time in the larger German theatre; it influenced a decision in 1632 to reach a peace settlement between the Habsburgs and the Republic \u2014 the peace talks were unsuccessful however.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\nDupuy, Trevor and Rachel Dupuy (1986).

He disappeared after setting a postwar aviation record for prize money, and was the object of repeated searches throughout the years.\n\nWar service\nJames was living in Watford, Ontario when he enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps, and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant on 22 September 1917. After the completion of his training, he was posted to No. 45 Squadron in Italy on 12 February 1918 as a Sopwith Camel pilot. On 3 June 1918, he scored his first aerial triumph, destroying an enemy Albatros D.V over Feltre. Four days later, he destroyed two Albatros D.IIIs, one over San Marino and the other over Colicella. His next two victories over Albatros D.Vs that he destroyed east of Feltre on 20 July made him an ace.On 5 August 1918, he destroyed the only reconnaissance plane of his career, an AEG. The next day, he sent down two Albatros D.Vs over Segusino and destroyed a third. On the last day of August, he rounded out his victory string by destroying two Albatros D.Vs near Arsiero.On 23 September 1918, Lieutenant James was promoted to temporary captain, and in November 1918 was awarded Distinguished Flying Cross, with the following citation: \n\n\"An excellent scout pilot who has at all times shown great skill, courage and determination in attacking enemy machines. During a short period of time he has destroyed nine enemy aeroplanes\".On 6 May 1919, James surrendered his commission in the Royal Air Force upon being transferred to the unemployed list. He shipped out to the United States.\n\nDisappearance\nFinal flight\nOn 28 May 1919 James flew what was reputedly the first Sopwith Camel in the United States, from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Boston, Massachusetts. He was competing for a $1,000 prize offered by The Boston Globe for fastest flight between the two cities. At 115 miles per hour despite headwinds, he was much faster than a prior competitor's 90 mph gait. After landing at a field eight miles north of Boston, James departed again at 6 PM, supposedly for a stop at Mitchel Field on Long Island en route to Atlantic City, both of which are southwest of Boston. He buzzed frightened spectators watching his takeoff.It was Captain James' intent to follow railroad tracks from Boston on his return flight. He apparently guided on the wrong set of railroad tracks, as he later landed at Tyringham, Massachusetts, (near Lee), about 100 air miles west of Boston, to have his aircraft serviced. On 29 May, he was reportedly seen at 11:30 AM at an altitude of about 5,000 feet over Connecticut after departing Lee, Massachusetts; he apparently had a sound engine at that sighting and was headed southeast.A more reliable report tells a somewhat different story. On the morning of 2 June 1919, he took off from Tyringham toward the south, then turned west, away from Boston. He drew a crowd of spectators for his departure because the local populace was not used to aircraft. Because of his direction of flight, they thought he might be returning to the field he departed, but he did not reappear.\n\nSearch efforts\nVarious search efforts were attempted in the years that followed James' disappearance. On 4 June 1919 it was reported that an aeroplane with its engine running had been heard near Millerton, New York. On 5 August 1919, a berry picker in a ravine on Mount Riga outside Millerton, New York found aircraft wreckage which was speculated to be James'. In December 1925 a hunting party had found some apparent wreckage in the remote woods near Tyringham but did not think much of it at the time and only in the weeks after returning did they realize the significance and mounted an unsuccessful search to relocate it. James's uncle had posted a reward for the recovery of his nephew's remains shortly after the disappearance which was still being offered at the time. On 19 May 1927, U. S. Coast Guard Boat 290 found an aircraft wing floating in Fort Pond Bay, Long Island Sound. Captain James's brother, E. D. James, wrote a letter requesting a description of the wing, hoping to identify it. There was another report that his plane might have gone down in a river at Poughkeepsie, New York, but nothing was found. Despite extensive searches for him spurred partially by rewards offered, no sign of James has ever been found. The aircraft debris that had been found was never positively identified as being from James' plane.\n\nSee also\nFlying aces\nNo. 45 Squadron RAF\nList of people who disappeared\nList of World War I aces credited with 11\u201314 victories\nPassage 6:\nPyrrhic victory\nA Pyrrhic victory ( (listen) PIRR-ik) is a victory that inflicts such a devastating toll on the victor that it is tantamount to defeat. Such a victory negates any true sense of achievement or damages long-term progress. \nThe phrase originates from a quote from Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose triumph against the Romans in the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC destroyed much of his forces, forcing the end of his campaign.\n\nEtymology\nA \"Pyrrhic victory\" is named after King Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose army suffered irreplaceable casualties in defeating the Romans at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC and the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC, during the Pyrrhic War. After the latter battle, Plutarch relates in a report by Dionysius:\n\nThe armies separated; and, it is said, Pyrrhus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that one other such victory would utterly undo him. For he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the confederates in Italy backward. On the other hand, as from a fountain continually flowing out of the city, the Roman camp was quickly and plentifully filled up with fresh men, not at all abating in courage for the loss they sustained, but even from their very anger gaining new force and resolution to go on with the war.\nIn both Epirote victories, the Romans suffered greater casualties, but they had a much larger pool of replacements, so the casualties had less impact on the Roman war effort than the losses of King Pyrrhus.\nThe report is often quoted as:\n\nNe ego si iterum eodem modo vicero, sine ullo milite Epirum revertar.\nIf I achieve such a victory again, I shall return to Epirus without any soldier.\nor\n\nIf we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.\n\nExamples\nWar\nThis list comprises examples of battles that ended in a Pyrrhic victory. It is not intended to be complete but to illustrate the concept.\n\nBattle of Asculum (279 BC), Pyrrhus of Epirus and Italian allies against the Roman Republic: the Romans, though suffering twice as many casualties, could easily replenish their ranks. Pyrrhus lost most of his commanders and a great part of the forces he had brought to Italy, and he withdrew to Sicily.\nBattle of Avarayr (451), Vardan Mamikonian and Christian Armenian rebels against the Sassanid Empire: the Persians were victorious but the battle proved to be a strategic victory for Armenians, as Avarayr paved the way to the Nvarsak Treaty (484 AD), which assured Armenian autonomy and religious freedom.\nSiege of Szigetv\u00e1r (1566), Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars: although the Ottomans won the siege, it can be seen as a Pyrrhic victory because of the heavy Ottoman casualties, the death of Sultan Suleiman, and the resulting delay to the Ottoman push for Vienna that year which suspended Ottoman expansion in Europe.\nSiege of Ostend (1601\u20131604), Eighty Years' War: for three years the Spanish attempted to capture this port from Dutch and English defenders, even as the Dutch expanded their territory further east \u2013 including capturing the port of Sluis to replace Ostend before surrendering. The vast cost and casualties of the siege were compounded by Spain's subsequent campaign to recapture the Dutch gains, which achieved little, and by 1607 Spain was bankrupt. The resultant Twelve Years' Truce effectively made the Dutch Republic an independent state.\nBattle of Malplaquet (1709), War of the Spanish Succession: the battle was an Allied victory because Marlborough's army kept possession of the battlefield, but it had suffered double the French casualties and could not pursue. The French army withdrew in good order and relatively intact, and it remained a potent threat to further Allied operations.\nBattle of Gangwana (1741) fought between 1,000 strong Rathore cavalry of Jodhpur and combined armies of Mughal Empire, and Jaipur Numbering 100,000 with hundreds of cannons and artillery at Gangwana the Jaipur emerged victorious but with heavy losses of 12,000 and thousands other wounded\nBattle of Bunker Hill (1775), American Revolutionary War: after mounting three assaults on the colonial forces, the British won control of the Boston peninsula in the early stages of the war, but the engagement cost them many more casualties than the Americans had incurred (including a large number of officers) and led them to adopt more cautious methods, which helped American rebel forces; the political repercussions increased colonial support for independence.\nBattle of Guilford Court House (1781), American Revolutionary War: in this short battle, the outnumbered British force defeated an American army; the British lost a considerable number of men, and their drive to conquer the southern colonies changed course.\nBattle of Chancellorsville (1863), American Civil War: General Robert E. Lee split his army in the face of Hooker's larger Union force; the audacious strategy allowed the Confederate army to win the day against a numerically superior foe. However, 20% of Lee's army was injured or killed, including General Stonewall Jackson, and his losses were difficult to replace. Lee's weakened army went on the offensive, but less than two months later was defeated and forced to retreat after the Battle of Gettysburg.\nBattle of the Santa Cruz Islands (1942), World War II, Solomon Islands Campaign: Japanese and Allied naval forces met during the struggle for Guadalcanal and nearby islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, U.S. surface ships retreated with one carrier sunk and another severely damaged. The Japanese carrier forces achieved a tactical victory, as none of their ships were sunk, but the heavy loss of irreplaceable veteran aircrews was to the strategic advantage of the Allies. Japanese ground forces on Guadalcanal had also just lost the Battle for Henderson Field and were in no position to take advantage of the new situation.\nBattle of Chosin Reservoir (1950), Korean War: the Chinese army attempted to encircle and destroy the UN forces but in a 17-day battle in freezing weather, the UN forces inflicted crippling losses on the Chinese while making a fighting withdrawal. The Chinese occupied northeast Korea but they did not recover until the spring, and the UN maintained a foothold in Korea.\nSecond Battle of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb (1972), Vietnam War: The army of the Republic of Vietnam, with the support of ground artillery, ship gunboats, and bombers, attacked the ancient citadel of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb. Although the citadel was recaptured after 81 days and nights, the ARVN army was weakened and after only 2 years, the Republic of Vietnam collapsed and the communists unified the North and South.\nBattle of Vukovar (1991), Croatian War of Independence: the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) laid siege to the city of Vukovar, held by the Croatian National Guard and civilian volunteers. After 87 days, the ruined city fell to the JNA. Although the city was besieged from all sides, it exhausted the Yugoslav army and Serbian paramilitaries that had about twenty times more soldiers and complete armoured and artillery superiority, and they had twice as many losses. It was a turning point in the Croatian War of Independence.\n\nPolitics, sports and law\nThe term is used as an analogy in business, politics and sport to describe struggles that end up ruining the victor. Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr commented on the necessity of coercion in preserving the course of justice by warning,\n\nMoral reason must learn how to make coercion its ally without running the risk of a Pyrrhic victory in which the ally exploits and negates the triumph.\nIn Beauharnais v. Illinois, a 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving a charge proscribing group libel, Associate Justice Black alluded to Pyrrhus in his dissent,\n\nIf minority groups hail this holding as their victory, they might consider the possible relevancy of this ancient remark: \"Another such victory and I am undone\".\n\nSee also\nPassage 7:\nBattle of Mar\u00eda\nThe Battle of Mar\u00eda (15 June 1809) saw a small Spanish army led by Joaqu\u00edn Blake y Joyes face an Imperial French corps under Louis Gabriel Suchet.\n\nBackground\nThe Spanish campaign in early 1809 started with the Battle of Ucl\u00e9s.\n\nBattle\nAfter an inconclusive contest earlier in the day, Suchet's cavalry made a decisive charge that resulted in a French victory. Though the Spanish right wing was crushed, the rest of Blake's army got away in fairly good order after abandoning most of its artillery. Mar\u00eda de Huerva is located 17 kilometres (10.6 mi) southwest of Zaragoza, Spain. The action occurred during the Peninsular War which was part of the larger struggle known as the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAftermath\nThe Spanish campaign in early 1809 proceeded with the French advance in Catalonia in the Battle of Belchite.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nBattle of H\u00f6chst\nThe Battle of H\u00f6chst (20 June 1622) was fought between a Catholic League army led by Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly and a Protestant army commanded by Christian the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, close to the town of H\u00f6chst, today a suburb of the city of Frankfurt am Main. The result was a one-sided Catholic League victory. The action occurred during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nBackground\nIn April 1622, Tilly had lost the Battle of Mingolsheim to Ernst von Mansfeld. In early May, however, Tilly won a decisive engagement with Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden-Durlach at the Battle of Wimpfen, which dispersed or killed approximately 3\/4 of Georg Friederich's army, leaving only Christian of Brunswick and Ernst von Mansfeld to command in the coming battle. Meanwhile, even though Tilly had lost the army of Gonzalo de C\u00f3rdoba, who had left, Tilly was more than compensated by the troops of General Tommaso Caracciolo and the count of Anholt, Johann Jakob.\nChristian wanted to use the situation for a crucial strike against the Catholic League. With 12,000 infantrymen, nearly 5,000 cavalrymen, and three guns he moved from Westphalia along the Weser River shoreline, and through Hesse towards the Main River to unite his troops with armies of Mansfeld and Baden-Durlach, at Darmstadt. Continuing their mission of blocking a rendezvous between Mansfeld and Christian of Brunswick, the Catholic forces reached the river at H\u00f6chst on 20 June to find Christian's army already crossing the river.\n\nBattle\nOn 15 June, Christian reached the territory of the Archbishopric of Mainz at Oberursel. He sent Colonel Dodo zu Innhausen und Knyphausen with an advance guard of 1,500 men against H\u00f6chst to take the town in a coup de main and to safeguard the Main crossing point. However, the H\u00f6chst municipal troops successfully defended the town against Knyphausen's initial assault. On the 16th Knyphausen's troops finally stormed and plundered H\u00f6chst.\nTwo days later the Protestants started building a pontoon bridge across the Main. Meanwhile, Christian moved with his troops towards H\u00f6chst and destroyed the villages of Oberusel, Eschborn, and Sulzbach. At the same time the Catholic troops approached in forced marches from W\u00fcrzburg with 20,000 infantrymen, 6,000 cavalrymen, and 18 guns. On 19 June, they arrived at the Nidda River between Nied and Sossenheim late at night.When the bridge was completed in the morning of 20 June, Christian's baggage started to cross the river. Tilly planned to force Christian's troops back to the H\u00f6chst walls and the Main, isolating the two thousand troops in Sossenheim. Hence, Christian ordered his troops to withdraw over the pontoon bridge towards Kelsterbach, but under the Catholic artillery fire the withdrawal turned into a headlong flight. The bridge broke after only 3,000 men had crossed and many of Christian's soldiers and horses drowned in the Main.By the time H\u00f6chst castle was captured at around 10 p.m., Christian had already lost a third of his army and was forced to retreat. Mansfeld lost an additional 2,000 troops acting as rearguard at Mannheim. Christian's entire baggage train and guns became Catholic loot. While the League troops lost only 100 soldiers, nearly 2,000 of Christian's soldiers died. However, Christian succeeded in escaping with 3,000 cavalrymen, 8,000 infantrymen, and his war chest, eventually uniting with Mansfeld's army. More recent investigations, however, showed that Christian had lost most of his booty.\n\nAftermath\nTilly claimed a strategic victory because his army had far fewer losses, despite the fact that Christian of Brunswick had achieved his operational goal of uniting his army with Mansfeld's. As a result of the battle, however, his troops were severely demoralised and had also lost most of their equipment, making them more of a liability than a reinforcement.H\u00f6chst was the decisive battle of the 1622 campaign and signalled the end for \"Winter King\" Frederick V. \nShortly after the battle, the combined Protestant forces, now numbering 26,000 strong, positioned themselves on the western bank of the Rhine and ceased to resist the invasion of the Palatinate.\nFrederick cancelled their contract and they were then hired by the Dutch Republic to lift the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom. On their way there, they were intercepted by C\u00f3rdoba's troops in the Battle of Fleurus on 29 August and strategically defeated him despite suffering greater losses.\nHeidelberg came under siege and despite an 11-week resistance, fell on 15 September.\nWith this news, the token English forces under Sir Horace Vere evacuated Mannheim, which fell on 2 November, and moved to the fortress of Frankenthal, which served as a final outpost for Protestant resistance in this area. It fell the following year. Duke Maximillian now controlled half of the Lower Palatinate and installed Heinrich von Metternich as governor.\n\nIllustrations of the battle\nThe Swiss engraver Merian depicted the battle and the bridging of the Main in an engraving. Another contemporary engraving of an unknown artist shows the battle in a large panorama.  Neither of these artists had been an eye witness of the event.\nPassage 9:\nLloyd Andrews Hamilton\nFirst Lieutenant Lloyd Andrews Hamilton (13 June 1894 \u2013 24 August 1918) was a World War I flying ace credited with ten aerial victories. During five months of 1918 he became an ace with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and then again with the United States Air Service (USAS). Hamilton Air Force Base is named after him.\n\nEarly life\nLloyd Andrews Hamilton was born in Troy, New York, the only child of Methodist minister Reverend John A. Hamilton and his wife Jennie Andrews Hamilton. He was a bright scholar who took his Baccalaureate Degree magnum cum laude from Syracuse University in 1916 and was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. He initiated post-graduate studies at Harvard Business School in September 1916. When America entered World War I, he enlisted in the USAS, on 28 April and in May he reported to Plattsburgh, New York, for officer training.\n\nAviation service\nHamilton shipped out to England in late 1917 where he trained in early 1918 in an Avro 504, perhaps at RFC Bramham Moor which was then renamed RAF Tadcaster, near Bramham cum Oglethorpe in Yorkshire. Hamilton was temporarily posted as a first lieutenant to United Kingdom No. 3 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, on 2 March 1918 He first scored as a combat pilot on 11 April 1918, flying the Sopwith Camel against his first German opponent, an LVG C.VI observation aircraft. The next day he made his second aerial kill; his third a week later. On 20 April he was flying at the tail end of 'C' flight when his commander Richard Raymond-Barker was attacked and killed by Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron. From far away Hamilton saw Richthofen shoot down a second aviator (who crashed but lived), then Hamilton was near enough to engage a blue Fokker Dr.I triplane, expending more than 300 rounds at it after which it went into a dive and spin, but Hamilton's own maneuvers prevented him from seeing what happened to it. Hamilton returned to base and claimed a kill but it was never confirmed\u2014all of Richthofen's flight had returned safe from the engagement. On 3 June 1918, Hamilton became an ace, scoring his fifth confirmed victory.Hamilton was assigned to the USAS 17th Aero Squadron to help them complete their training. When they moved into combat, he was one of their Flight Commanders. In his service he downed three enemy aircraft and two observation balloons, becoming a double ace\u2014once flying under RFC command and once again for USAS. His first USAS victory on 7 August was during an offensive patrol; the squadron was flying high at 16,000 feet (5,000 m) when they noticed eight Fokker D.VIIs well below them over Armenti\u00e8res. The 17th squadron dove to attack and Hamilton downed an enemy aircraft after firing 200 rounds.On Hamilton's final mission he was paired with Lt. Jesse F. Campbell to bomb and strafe transports along the Bapaume\u2013Cambrai road, to strafe enemy troops in retreat and to attack an observation balloon that had been spotted to the north. After dropping their bombs on a small building and transports, Campbell and Hamilton turned to bust the balloon. Hamilton sprayed the balloon with machine gun rounds, and its German observer officer was seen to jump from the basket as the balloon exploded in flame. Hamilton was then killed by defensive fire from ground forces.\n\nLegacy\nHamilton scored five victories each in 3 Squadron RAF and in the 17th Aero Squadron. He shared some of his victories teamed with such other aces as Douglas John Bell, William Tipton, Adrian Franklyn, Will Hubbard, and Robert Miles Todd.Hamilton's body was laid to rest at Pittsfield Cemetery in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. His father mentioned Hamilton in Sunday sermons for many years after the war.In July 1932, the new military airfield at Novato, California was named Hamilton Field in tribute. In April 1934, a plaque was emplaced to commemorate him.\n\nHonors and awards\nDistinguished Service Cross (DSC)\nThe Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Lloyd A. Hamilton, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action at Varssenaere, Belgium, August 13, 1918. Leading a low bombing attack on a German aerodrome, 30 miles behind the line, Lieutenant Hamilton destroyed the hangars on the north side of the aerodrome and then attacked a row of enemy machines, flying as low as 20 feet from the ground despite intense machine-gun fire, and setting fire to three of the German planes. He then turned and fired bursts through the windows of the chateau in which the German pilots were quartered, 26 of whom were afterwards reported killed. General Orders No. 20, W.D., 1919.Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC)\nOn 13 August 1918, Lt. Hamilton led his flight on a special mission against Varssenaere aerodrome. He dropped four bombs from 200 feet on some aeroplane hangars, making two direct hits and causing a large amount of damage. He then machine gunned the German officers' billets and made four circuits of the aerodrome, shooting up various targets. On the first circuit, he destroyed one EA on the ground which burst into flames when he shot it up. On the third circuit he repeated this performance, setting afire another Fokker biplane. His dash and skill very materially helped in the success of the operation. In addition this officer destroyed a Fokker biplane over Armenti\u00e8res on 7 August 1918. On 12 July he brought down two EA in flames and on two other occasions has driven down out of control enemy machines. He is an excellent patrol leader.\n\nSee also\nList of World War I flying aces from the United States\nPassage 10:\nSiege of Genoa (1800)\nThe siege of Genoa (6 April \u2013 4 June 1800) saw Austria besiege and capture the city of Genoa from France during the War of the Second Coalition. However, the battle was ultimately a successful diversion conducted by Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na's forces that allowed Napoleon to win the subsequent Battle of Marengo. In the end, around 30,000 of Genoa's 160,000 inhabitants had died of starvation and disease in the course of the siege.\n\nBackground\nAfter Massena's victory in the Second Battle of Zurich, the alliance between Russia and Austria ended. Though this did not end the war, Napoleon soon came back from Egypt and proclaimed himself First Consul, greatly improving French chances of victory. However, the consul needed time to move his troops into Italy, so he ordered Mass\u00e9na to hold Nice and Genoa at all costs until he arrived.\n\nBeginning\nInitially, the French had about 60,000 soldiers, but this number was reduced to about 36,000 fighting men due to a typhus epidemic that had also taken the lives of two of Mass\u00e9na's predecessors, generals Jean-\u00c9tienne Championnet and Jean-Antoine Marbot. The Austrian commander, Michael von Melas, had around 120,000 soldiers available in Italy. After the first engagements, despite the bravery of French soldiers under Louis-Gabriel Suchet and Jean-de-Dieu Soult, Genoa was soon cut off from any outside help. By 6 April, the French were surrounded not only by land, but also by sea where a strong British squadron had just taken up positions. Nevertheless, French morale remained high and Mass\u00e9na was determined to hold on.\n\nSiege\nThough Genoa was defended both by nature and by strong fortifications, Mass\u00e9naa planned a more offensive strategy. On 7 April, he ordered an attack on Monte Ratti, which resulted in the Austrians being thrown out of the Apennines and the French capturing about 1,500 prisoners, including General-Major Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspr\u00e9. Two days later, Mass\u00e9na began a desperate operation to unite with the rest of the French forces commanded by Suchet. Although Massena was cut off with only 1,200 soldiers against 10,000 Austrians, he endured their attacks and, with the help of Soult, captured another 4,000 prisoners. After this battle, the French finally shut themselves in the city. Other desperately fought battles soon followed, especially those for Fort Quezzi and Fort Richelieu, inflicting further heavy casualties on the Austrians. French forces then captured Mount Creto, forcing the Austrians to halt all further actions.\nIn the meantime, Bonaparte was marching with the Army of the Reserve not to the relief of Genoa, but to Milan, where he spent six days. By the end of May, plague had spread throughout Genoa and the civilian population was in revolt. Negotiations for the exchange of prisoners began in early June, but the citizens and some of the garrison clamoured for capitulation. Unknown to Mass\u00e9na, the Austrian general Peter Ott had been ordered to raise the siege because Bonaparte had crossed Great St. Bernard Pass and was now threatening the main Austrian army. Describing the situation at Genoa, Ott requested and received permission to continue the siege. On 4 June, Mass\u00e9na's negotiator finally agreed to evacuate the French army from Genoa. However, \"if the word capitulation was mentioned or written\", Mass\u00e9na threatened to end all negotiations.Two days later, a few of the French left the city by sea, but the bulk of Mass\u00e9na's starving and exhausted troops marched out of the city with all their equipment and followed the road along the coast toward France, ending one of the most remarkable sieges in modern military history. The siege was an astonishing demonstration of tenacity, ingenuity, courage, and daring that garnered additional laurels for Mass\u00e9na and placed him in a category previously reserved for Bonaparte alone.\n\nAftermath\nThe gruelling siege of some sixty days had ended but it played an important role in Napoleon's strategy. By forcing the Austrians to deploy vast forces against himself at Genoa, Mass\u00e9na made it possible for Bonaparte to cross the Great St Bernard Pass, surprise the Austrians, and ultimately defeat General Melas's army at Marengo before sufficient reinforcements could be transferred from the siege site. Less than three weeks after the evacuation, Bonaparte wrote to Mass\u00e9na, \"I am not able to give you a greater mark of the confidence I have in you than by giving you command of the first army of the Republic [Army of Italy].\" The Austrians also recognized the significance of Mass\u00e9na's defense; the Austrian chief of staff declared firmly, \"You won the battle, not in front of Alessandria but in front of Genoa.\"\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Citations ==\nPassage 11:\nEarl Frederick Crabb\nLieutenant (later Major) Earl Frederick Crabb (March 27, 1899 \u2013 October 18, 1986) was a World War I flying ace credited with six aerial victories. After World War I, he was an aviation pioneer and bush pilot. He returned to military aviation during World War II. He flew as a commercial pilot until he was 72 years old.\n\nWorld War I\nCrabb served in 92 Squadron under the command of fellow ace and future Air Marshal Arthur Coningham. Crabbe flew a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a to score all six of his victories. They took place between 22 July and 29 October 1918. Crabbe downed five German Fokker D.VII fighters and a DFW reconnaissance plane; the latter kill was shared with fellow ace Thomas Stanley Horry and another pilot.Crabb was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross on 8 February 1919.\n\nBetween the wars\nCrabb remained in aviation after war's end. He barnstormed. He flew air mail from Boston and New York to Detroit during the 1920s. In the early 1930s, he was the first pilot hired by the U.S. Forest Service in Maine.\n\nWorld War II and beyond\nCrabb returned to duty for World War II as a major, joining the U.S. Army Air Corps and serving in Training Command. After his discharge in 1945, he returned to his civilian flying job. He retired as Chief Pilot with the Forest Service at age 65, circa 1964. He continued to fly as a commercial pilot until about 1971.\nPassage 12:\nHieronymus of Cardia\nHieronymus of Cardia (Greek: \u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, 354?\u2013250 BC) was a Greek general and historian from Cardia in Thrace, and a contemporary of Alexander the Great (356\u2013323 BC).\nAfter the death of Alexander he followed the fortunes of his friend and fellow-countryman Eumenes. He was wounded and taken prisoner by Antigonus, who pardoned him and appointed him superintendent of the asphalt beds in the Dead Sea. He was treated with equal friendliness by Antigonus's son Demetrius, who made him polemarch of Thespiae, and by Antigonus Gonatas, at whose court he died at the purported age of 104.\nHe wrote a history of the Diadochi and their descendants, encompassing the period from the death of Alexander to the war with Pyrrhus (323\u2013272 BC), which is one of the chief authorities used by Diodorus Siculus (xviii.\u2013xx.) and also by Plutarch in his life of Pyrrhus.\nHe made use of official papers and was careful in his investigation of facts. The simplicity of his style seemingly rendered his work unpopular to people of his time, but modern historians believe it was very good. In the last part of his work he made a praiseworthy attempt to acquaint the Greeks with the character and early history of the Romans. He is reproached by Pausanias (i. 9. 8) with unfairness towards all rulers with the exception of Antigonus Gonatas.\nLike the even more famous lost history of Alexander by Ptolemy I of Egypt, no significant amount of his work survived the end of the ancient world. He is among the authors whose fragments were collected in Karl Wilhelm Ludwig M\u00fcller's Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (II pp. 450\u201361), and in Felix Jacoby's Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker (= FGrHist 154).\nPassage 13:\nBattle of Sziksz\u00f3\nThe third and largest Battle of Sziksz\u00f3 was fought in October 1588 between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire as part of the Ottoman\u2013Hungarian wars. The Hungarian forces were fewer in number, but were victorious over the Ottomans.  This unexpected victory was even mentioned by Emperor Rudolf decades after the battle. It was one of the most important Hungarian victories in the post-Moh\u00e1cs period.\n\nEvents\nIn 1588, Pasha Sina of Buda marched with his soldiers towards Sziksz\u00f3, which belonged to Hungary and refused to pay taxes to Porta.  On October 8, Ottoman soldiers were already in the market town and looting when the border fort's rescue army led by Captain Sigismund R\u00e1k\u00f3czi from Eger arrived.  In contrast to the Ottoman army of 11,000 the Hungarian-German army could have been 2,400\u20132,500.  Despite the superiority, the latter still won.  More than two thousand Ottomans and about 400\u2013500 Hungarians and Germans were dead in the clash.  In the wake of this incident, the Habsburg court in Prague suspended the payment of a \u201cfair gift\u201d of 30,000 gold a year, fixed in the Drinapolis peace, in response to which Porta threatened war.\n\nPrelude\nIn 1588, Sziksz\u00f3 already owed 1,000 gold tax, so Sinan  Pasha of Buda organized a punitive tax collect campaign.  The six thousand cavalry and the same number of infantry were led by Kara Ali Beg, the commander of Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, against Putnok and then, after he could not take it, set off in the direction of Sziksz\u00f3.\n\nThe battle\nOn the afternoon of October 8, the Pasha arrived under the city and immediately began the siege of the church fortress, which was protected by armed citizens.  After two hours of siege, however, he was forced to retreat, because the rescue teams led by Major Sigismund R\u00e1k\u00f3czi from Eger arrived around 5 o'clock.\nWith 2,000 Hungarian warriors and 500 German warriors.  Kara Ali set fire to the church and the houses around it, then retreated to the Hern\u00e1d-Velvet triangle, where he arranged his army.  He arranged the riders on the right wing and the Janissaries on the left wing, setting up his four cannons in the middle.\nR\u00e1k\u00f3czi's army was led in the middle by Istv\u00e1n Drugeth Homonnai, chief of Zempl\u00e9n, the most famous knight of Upper Hungary, the black shield horsemen attacked the left wing, while the German riflemen collided with the Janissaries.\nKara Ali was seriously injured at the very beginning of the battle, so the command was taken over by Mustafa Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny, who also fell shortly afterwards.  At that time the Janissaries broke through the army of the attacking Hungarian armies, Istv\u00e1n Drugeth was captured, and R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was already considering retreating, when the Hungarian left wing rushed to the aid of the Germans, and thus managed to repel the Janissaries.\nThe order of war was completely disintegrated, and the struggle against man dragged on into the late night.  By this time, the third Turkish chief, Bajazid basa, the leader of the Janissaries, had also fallen.  Heling, the captain of the Germans, also fell.  By 11, the Turkish armies ran away.  The cavalry chased them to Saj\u00f3, and he also managed to free his Homons.\n1,700 Turkish and hundreds of Hungarian and German soldiers died in the battle.\n\nAftermath\nThe common grave where the dead were buried has since been called T\u00f6r\u00f6khalom.\nWith this victory, Sigismund R\u00e1k\u00f3czi became famous, Emperor Rudolf, even decades after the battle, mentioned the brilliant triumph, which was especially valuable because of the difference in the numbers of the two armies.","label":"longbench","length":16329,"title":"Passage 1:"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nCropper, Kentucky\nCropper is an unincorporated community within Shelby County, Kentucky, United States. It was also known as Croppers Depot. Their post office  is closed. The town of Cropper (Population Cal. at 205 in 2010) is located in northeast Shelby County, Kentucky. The origin of its name comes from the town's founder James Cropper, a blacksmith and store keeper who was the first person to build a house there sometime in the 1790s. He also was the town's first postmaster. The majority of Cropper's original citizens were members of the Low Dutch colony who were in the area as early as 1786. In 1807, a new group of settlers from Virginia increased the town's population. In 1855, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L and N) along with a depot opened on the east end of town. A hotel soon opened afterwards. This railroad line was closed in the early 1970s. Another occurrence, in 1855, was the founding of Union Grove Church. This church had three different denominations that included Christian, Methodist and Baptist. The only cemetery in Cropper is on the church grounds. In June 1900, the Baptist separated from the Union Church, and by 1903 it had its own building. In 1967, the Union Grove Church was renamed Cropper Christian Church. In 1905, a bank was opened by Ben Allen Thomas, but it was closed in 1921. An 1882 map shows the first school in Cropper which was a large two-story building with grades one through twelve. It burned in 1951 and was replaced with a one-story elementary school. The team mascot was the Yellow Jackets.\nPassage 2:\nStelljes House\nThe Stelljes House is a historic house on New Hampshire Route 31 in Goshen, New Hampshire. Built about 1800, it is one of the oldest of a cluster of plank-frame houses in Goshen. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It has possibly been demolished.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Stelljes House stands in a rural area of southern Goshen, on the east side of NH 31. It is a 1+1\u20442-story wooden structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A brick chimney rises slightly off-center from the roof ridge. The main facade is asymmetrical, with a slightly off-center entrance, two sash windows to its left, and a three-section modern picture window to the right. A gable dormer projects from the rear roof face. An ell extends from the southern portion of the rear of the main block, with a porch in the corner joining the two blocks.The house was built about 1800, and is one of the oldest of Goshen's cluster of plank-frame houses. The framing is three-inch planking attached vertically to sills, which rests on a rubble and granite stone foundation. Dowels are attached horizontally to give this framing lateral stability. The front facade was probably originally five bays across.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Sullivan County, New Hampshire\nPassage 3:\nHaverstraw, New York\nHaverstraw  is a town in Rockland County, New York, United States, located north of the Town of Clarkstown and the Town of Ramapo; east of Orange County; south of the Town of Stony Point; and west of the Hudson River. The town runs from the west to the east border of the county in its northern section.

That year the school's per-student cost was $5,500 but it relied on archdiocese funds as it deliberately had tuition below cost, at $3,600, so children of working class backgrounds could attend. It had an increasing enrollment at the time of closure, with 328 students in its final year.\n\nNotable people\nWilson P. Foss Jr., art collector and businessman\nWalter S.

Its population is 9,543 (2022). It is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) south west of Yalova and at the midpoint of Armutlu Peninsula. The settlement was founded  by an Ottoman kad\u0131 (\"judge\") . Hence it was named as Kad\u0131k\u00f6y (\"Judge's village\"). During Ottoman Empire most of the population was composed of Greeks. But according to Population exchange between Greece and Turkey agreement the Greek population was replaced by Turkish population from Greece. Refugees from Caucasus after the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) were also settled in the village. The village was declared a seat of township in 1991. Intensive farming such as green house farming and floriculture is the main economic activity of the town.\nPassage 5:\nTimnath, Colorado\nThe Town of Timnath is a Statutory Town located in Larimer County, Colorado, United States. Founded in 1882, Timnath is a small agricultural\/farming community located southeast of Fort Collins, Colorado, approximately one-half mile east of the Harmony Road\/Interstate 25 interchange, on a small bluff east of the Cache la Poudre River. The surrounding farmlands have been used primarily for potatoes, alfalfa, sugar beets, and cattle. Although the town has remained virtually unchanged in recent decades, the encroaching growth of both Fort Collins to the west and Windsor to the south have placed the town in an area considered favorable to development. The population was 6,487 at the 2020 census.  Timnath has been one of the fastest-growing communities in Colorado since 2020, and in 2021 had an estimated population of 7,839.\n\nDescription\nOther structures lining Main Street (a section of County Road 5) include elementary school (in the Poudre School District), a one-story modern post-office, and several other historic buildings. Most residences are single-family homes. There is another elementary school (Bethke Elementary) 2.8 miles away from the one lining Main Street.\n\nHistory\nThe area was first homesteaded by settlers in 1869. The first schoolhouse was constructed that year, approximately one-half mile west of the current town, and was named \"Fairview\". By 1880, the community had outgrown the schoolhouse, and new \"Fairview\" school was built just north of the current town. The school also served as an early meeting place for the Presbyterian Church. The turning point in the early history of the community was in 1882, with the arrival of the Greeley, Salt Lake and Pacific Railroad (controlled by the Union Pacific) linking Greeley and Fort Collins. The following year, the Presbyterian Church, petitioned by local residents, sent a missionary to found a congregation. The current structure along Main Street dates from that year.\nA post office was established in 1884, headed by Reverend Charles A. Taylor, the local Presbyterian minister. When the post office was formed, Taylor bestowed the current name of the town from the 14th chapter of the Book of Judges, as the place where Samson went to obtain a Philistine wife. In 1900 the second school became outdated and a new one was built, dropping the name \"Fairview\" permanently. This structure currently stands as an out-building to the current elementary school. A larger school was built in 1918 (which burned in 1935 and was rebuilt the following year). The school district was consolidated with that of Fort Collins in 1960.\nDuring World War II, the Empire of Japan launched Fu-Go balloon bombs that floated across the Pacific to the U.S. One of these bombs dropped and exploded in a field in Timnath.\n\nGeography\nTimnath is located at 40\u00b031'47\" North, 104\u00b058'54\" West (40.529718, -104.981654).As of 2013, the incorporated area of Timnath comprises 5.05 square miles of land.The historical downtown lies along County Road Five, which runs north\u2013south parallel to Interstate 25 half a mile to the east.

The town is located at the intersection of U.S. Routes 54 and 380.\n\nName\nThe name of the town is derived from the Spanish vernacular for reed grass (Carrizo), which grew significantly in the area and provided excellent feed for ranch cattle. The additional \"zo\" at the end of the town name was added to indicate abundance of Carrizo grass. The town is now often referred to colloquially as \"Zozo\".\n\nHistory\nPrior to 1899, the area was primarily a few ranches and a stagecoach crossing with limited permanent settlement. Lawrence Murphy, a merchant active in the Lincoln County War (1878), owned a major ranch in the area. The location of Carrizozo was selected as the site for a station on the El Paso and Northeastern Railway (EP&NE) main line in 1899. Carrizozo was chosen over the nearby booming mine town of White Oaks, resulting in large-scale migration from White Oaks to Carrizozo.The railroad brought businesses, growing population, and increased importance to the town of Carrizozo. As a result, a county referendum in 1909 moved the seat of Lincoln County from the town of Lincoln to Carrizozo. This decision resulted in a four-year legal battle that was eventually resolved in favor of Carrizozo by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Gray v. Taylor. The result was a boom in which railroad access and political importance combined to lead to significant population growth in Carrizozo. The population reached around 2,000 by 1920.During this time, Albert B. Fall, a U.S. Senator from New Mexico and later Secretary of the Interior, owned the Three Rivers Ranch just south of Carrizozo, but had to sell it to settle legal debts as a result of his involvement in the Teapot Dome scandal (1922\u20131923). During the same time, journalist Quentin Reynolds visited the town and wrote a piece on it for Collier's. Later, he wrote in The Wounded Don't Cry that \"I used to agree with Bugs that once you left New York, you were strictly on the horse and buggy circuit. But of late years I've had to modify that. Since then I've discovered New Orleans, San Francisco and a little place called Carrizozo, New Mexico, where I want to go when I die. I want to go there and gang around the drug store and sneak behind the prescription counter with Art Rolland and have a nip of what he calls Old Granddaddy then type out his prescriptions for him.\"Carrizozo is about 35 miles (56 km) east of the Trinity Site, where the first nuclear bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945. Residents reported tremors like an earthquake and, as the first major downwind settlement, the town received a significant part of the remnants of the mushroom cloud (resulting in some radioactive contamination of the area, which faded quickly and does not persist today).With the rise of the automobile, Carrizozo's proximity to the railroad became less important starting in the 1950s, and the last passenger train passed through in 1968. The result was a decrease in economic opportunity in Carrizozo, and the population fell back to about 1,200 people for much of the end of the 20th century. Recently, the town has seen increasing focus on tourism, and cherry cider produced in the town is known nationally.\n\nGeography\nCarrizozo is located at the northern end of the Tularosa Basin, which extends southward to the New Mexico\u2013Texas border. The town itself is located in a flat area known prior to the founding of the town as the Corrizo flats, with typical Chihuahuan desert scrub and desert grasslands.To the west of the town is the Carrizozo Malpais, a 40-mile-long (64 km) lava flow that is about 1,500 years old and accessible through the Valley of Fires Recreation Area. To the northeast is Carrizo Mountain, a 9,600-foot (2,900 m) peak within the Sacramento Mountains, and to the southeast are the Sierra Blanca mountain range.\n\nClimate\nDemographics\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 996 people living in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 78.71% White, 0.70% African American, 2.61% American Indian, 14.16% Other, and 3.82% identified as two or more. Hispanics of any race were 43.57% of the population. Of the population, 54.72% were men and 45.28% were women. Of these, 15.96% were under the age of 18, 24.50% were over 65, and 59.54% were between 18 and 65.\n\nTransportation\nCarrizozo is located at the intersection of U.S. Routes 54 and 380. For general aviation, the town is served by Carrizozo Municipal Airport.\n\nEducation\nCarrizozo Municipal Schools is the local school district.\n\nPoints of interest\nCarrizozo Women's Club (1920 Pueblo Revival style building listed in the National Register of Historic Places)\nCarrizozo Heritage Museum (1940s built as a frozen food locker\u2014converted into local history museum in 2003)\nLincoln National Forest (southeast of the city via U.S. Route 380 and NM 37)\nValley of Fires Recreation Area (west-northwest of the city via U.S. Route 380)\n\nFilm and television\nA number of movies have been filmed in Carrizozo.

Its population as of 1990 was 11,518; its population as of 2000 was 11,169. It is sometimes considered a suburb or small town within Panama City, northeast of the limits of the town of Balboa. Ancon Hill is also the name of a large hill that overlooks Panama City and once served as a form of protection from pirates and sea invasion. The township was originally located around this hill, and was created to house employees of the Panama Canal during its construction. As part of the construction effort, the historic Gorgas Army Hospital was founded and built on the hillside. The first ship to officially transit the canal, SS Ancon, was named after the district. The community continued to serve as housing for employees of the Panama Canal Company until 1980, when parts of it began to be turned over to the Panamanian government under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Modern-day Anc\u00f3n is a corregimiento (the Panamanian equivalent of a suburb in the United States) of Panama City, serving mainly as a residential area. The Gorgas Army Hospital building is now the Panamanian Oncology Hospital, primarily used for cancer research. The area also houses Panama's Supreme Court, just a few feet away from the Gorgas Army Hospital building, and several Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute buildings for research into tropical biology. Anc\u00f3n is also a parish (parroquia) of the District of Panama, located in the Panama Canal adjacent area.\n\nHistory\nThe area where the district of Anc\u00f3n is located was always conceived as a place of transit. From the Spanish arrival on the Isthmus of Panama in 1501, it was thought to build there a road between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, an idea that was materialized with the construction of the Panama Canal.During the years when the Panama Canal was under the control of the United States, many administrative facilities, military bases, and communities were built in the adjacent areas, forming part of the former Panama Canal Zone. When these areas were reverted to Panama under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, several alternatives were proposed to integrate the district to the city of Panama. The current district of Anc\u00f3n was created when a new political-administrative division for the reverted areas was adopted, by Act No. 18 of August 29, 1979, and later amended by Law No. 1 of October 27, 1982. The areas located in the Pacific sector became part of this district, while those located on the Atlantic side were incorporated into the district of Cristobal, in the province of Colon. They remain characterized by a strong US urban architectural style.\n\nEconomy\nDue to its geographical location, the district of Anc\u00f3n is of great importance for the economy of Panama. In it are located most of the administrative facilities and services related to the Panama Canal. Balboa is home to the port of Panama City. The district also home to the Administrative Unit of Reverted properties of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, established in 2007 as a replacement for the former Inter-Oceanic Region Authority. Many of the buildings belonging to former US military bases are today sites of Panamanian governmental and nongovernmental institutions, such as the City of Knowledge, the main science and technology park in the country, in the area of the former Fort Clayton.\nBesides its importance in the fields of trade and intermodal transportation, the district is becoming increasingly relevant in terms of services and tourism. Anc\u00f3n is home to the Marcos A. Gelabert International Airport, the Grand National Transportation Terminal, and Albrook Mall, the largest mall in the country.\n\nSites of interest\nThe district of Anc\u00f3n includes the Parque Natural Metropolitano, a vast jungle located a few minutes from the city, and its highest elevation, Ancon Hill. In its urban areas, you can visit several historical sites of the Panamanian capital, the building that houses the headquarters of the  Panama Canal Authority, popularly known as the Administration Building. The Amador Causeway, a section of which runs over the sea, joining three small Pacific islands, is one of the city's most popular tourist attractions, with marinas, restaurants, bars, and discoth\u00e8ques. There is also the Figali Convention Center, while the Museum of Biodiversity, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry, is currently in construction.\n\nSee also\nPostage stamps and postal history of the Canal Zone\nPassage 9:\nCarpenter, Colorado\nCarpenter is a ghost town in Mesa County, Colorado, United States, twelve miles northeast of Grand Junction at the end of an extension to 27\u00bc Road. The settlement was established by William Thomas Carpenter early in 1890 to provide the miners who worked in his two Book Cliff mines with a place to live. He began building shacks to house his single miners and later erected small houses for the employees with families.\nAs a result of the town's rapid growth, a request to the U.S. post office to establish a branch there in June 1890 was quickly obliged and the community was officially dubbed Carpenter. However, the town never attained a population of over 50, and the post office closed after one year. After the closure of its post office, Carpenter built a company store and a combination boarding house\/restaurant. Book Cliff company stone cutters and masons constructed several buildings and many foundations at Carpenter, using stone from the company quarry near the cliffs. One of the finest examples of a building made of Book Cliff sandstone is the Fruita, Colorado Catholic church.\nSeveral years of prosperity followed the arrival of the Little Book Cliff Railway at the townsite in 1892. Carpenter began to formulate big plans for his village. He envisioned it as a tourist resort complete with hotel, dance pavilion, picnic areas, and even a lake that was to be fed by a spring located near his Book Cliff mines. Carpenter renamed the camp Poland Spring after a noted resort of that name in Maine. It was variously referred to as Polen, Pollen, and Polan Springs, although Carpenter's intended name was evidenced by his having it emblazoned on the side of one of his railroad excursion cars. The resort plans were never completed because Carpenter went broke shortly after the Panic of 1893.\nIsaac Chauncey Wyman, a wealthy Massachusetts investor, became the next owner of the Book Cliff company. The town continued to enjoy an active existence because he did much to improve the mines and thus created a need for additional employees. The old eating house, referred to as the Hotel de Carpenter on occasion, was converted into a school and church for the camp's inhabitants, and many company structures were rebuilt and improved during Wyman's tenure as owner. The new name Book Cliff was applied to the town but did not adhere any better than did Poland Springs. Usually, people referred to the place as the \u201cBook Cliff Mines.\u201d\nThe town reached its zenith and then began a gradual decline following Wyman's death in 1910. In his will, Wyman left the town, railroad, and mines to Princeton University. Princeton managed everything for 15 years then decided to abandon it all in 1925. By the end of that summer nearly everything had been sold, dismantled, and hauled away.\nPassage 10:\nGoshen, New Hampshire\nGoshen is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 796 at the 2020 census.\n\nHistory\nIncorporated in 1791, Goshen was first settled in 1768 as a part of Saville (now Sunapee). The name \"Goshen\" may have been taken from Goshen, Connecticut, where many residents had relatives.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 22.5 square miles (58.4 km2), of which 22.4 square miles (58.1 km2) are land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2) are water, comprising 0.41% of the town. Goshen is drained by the South Branch Sugar River and its tributaries Blood Brook and Gunnison Brook, and hence lies almost fully within the Connecticut River watershed. Most of the southeast part of town is drained by Cherry Brook, one of the headwaters of the Ashuelot River, a southwest-flowing tributary of the Connecticut, but a small area at the southeast corner of town has the headwaters of the east-flowing West Branch Warner River, part of the Merrimack River watershed.The long ridge of Mount Sunapee occupies the eastern edge of town. The highest point in Goshen is an unnamed knob on the ridge (near Goves Mountain) where the elevation reaches 2,529 feet (771 m) above sea level.\nNew Hampshire Route 10 passes through the western part of the town, including Goshen village, and leads north to Newport and south to Keene. New Hampshire Route 31 has its northern terminus at Route 10 and leads southeast to Hillsborough.\n\nAdjacent municipalities\nSunapee, New Hampshire (north)\nNewbury, New Hampshire (east)\nBradford, New Hampshire (southeast at one point)\nWashington, New Hampshire (south)\nLempster, New Hampshire (southwest)\nUnity, New Hampshire (west)\nNewport, New Hampshire (northwest)\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 741 people, 279 households, and 219 families residing in the town.

The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.5 males.\nThe median income for a household in the town was $42,625, and the median income for a family was $45,208. Males had a median income of $33,333 versus $22,727 for females. The per capita income for the town was $20,561.  About 6.9% of families and 8.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.8% of those under age 18 and 21.5% of those age 65 or over.\n\nEducation\nGoshen and the neighboring town of Lempster maintained a combined elementary and middle school, called Goshen-Lempster Cooperative School, located in Lempster. The school served kindergarten through 8th grade. The cooperative was dissolved in June 2016.  The majority of Goshen elementary and middle-school aged children now attend Newport, NH schools; the Newport school system now acts as the anchor system for Goshen students.\nAfter 8th grade, students are given the choice to attend several neighboring high schools, including Newport High School, Sunapee Middle-High School, and Kearsarge Regional High School.\n\nNotable people\nJohn Williams Gunnison (1812\u20131853), US Army officer, explorer of the American West","label":"longbench","length":11851,"title":"Passage 1:"}

It is based on actual events and depicts the 185th Airborne Division Folgore during the battle of El-Alamein. The screenwriter and military advisor was Marcantonio Bragadin.\n\nPlot\nIn the summer of 1942, during the Second World War, a group of young paratroopers from the Folgore Division, after having undergone a long and tiring training in Italy, was transported by air to the Libyan desert to cover the Italian-German front. The young soldiers believe that their destination is the island of Malta (operation C3) or the area of Alexandria: instead they find themselves thrown into a desert region where they are forced to live in holes dug in the sand and to face with insufficient means the armored British armored units. They will sadly see their parachutes piled up inside a warehouse in the desert. Thus develops that epic fight, which takes the name of the battle of El-Alamein, in which a handful of heroic fighters try with every effort to stop or at least delay the advance of General Montgomery's British tanks. Once their line-up has broken through, the survivors resist for several days an unequal struggle against the preponderant English forces, even being mentioned, for their heroism, by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who called them \"The lions of the Thunderbolt\".\n\nCast\nEttore Manni: The Captain\nFausto Tozzi: The Sergeant\nJos\u00e9 Jaspe: Salvi\nMarco Guglielmi: Lt.

He competed at the 1980 Summer Olympics.\nPassage 5:\nDudley Russell\nLieutenant General Sir Dudley Russell KBE, CB, DSO, MC (1 December 1896 \u2013 4 February 1978) was a senior officer of both the British Army and the British Indian Army, and served during World War I and World War II, where he commanded the 8th Indian Infantry Division during the Italian Campaign from late 1943 until the end of the war in 1945.\n\nEarly career\nRussell received a temporary commission in 1914 and in 1915 joined the 7th (Service) Battalion, Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) with whom he served during World War I. In October 1917 he transferred to the British Indian Army and in November was commissioned as a lieutenant into the 97th Deccan Infantry serving in Egypt. In March 1919, as an acting captain he was awarded the MC, the citation for which read In  the  attack on the Tabsor system of trenches on the 19th September, 1918, he displayed conspicuous gallantry and leadership. His personal example of coolness, the marked skill with which he led his company under very heavy artillery and machine-gun fire, and his initiative in locating the objective, enabled the two attacking companies to capture the position with promptness and very few casualties\nRussell's promotion to substantive captain did not come until 1923 but was antedated to June 1919.In the 1922 reorganisation of the Indian Army his regiment became the 3rd Battalion of the 19th Hyderabad Regiment. During the period between the world wars he attended the Staff College, Quetta. In 1935 he transferred to the 6th Royal (Scinde) battalion 13th Frontier Force Rifles. In 1936 he qualified as a higher standard interpreter in Pashto which resulted in his widely used nickname of \"Pasha\". He was promoted lieutenant colonel in April 1938 and commanded the 6th Battalion from 1938 to 1940.\n\nWorld War II\nEast Africa\nIn August 1940 his battalion joined 9th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the newly formed 5th Indian Infantry Division and was shipped to the Sudan. Here he was appointed the division's GSO1 (senior headquarters staff officer), replacing Frank Messervy who took command of Gazelle Force which was being formed as a mobile strike force to operate against the Italians along the border with Eritrea.From October 1940 to August 1941 during the East African Campaign Colonel Russell continued in this role performing a key function in the campaign fought by 4th and 5th Indian Infantry Division in Eritrea. He negotiated the surrender of the Italian forces commanded by Amadeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta at Amba Alagi. For his services in East Africa Russell was awarded the OBE.\n\nNorth Africa\nThe 5th Indian Division moved to Cairo in June 1941 and then Iraq in August, returning to Egypt in October more or less coincidental with Russell's promotion to brigadier and assuming command of the 4th Indian Infantry Division's 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of XIII Corps in the newly created British Eighth Army.On 18 November 1941 Eighth Army launched Operation Crusader. Initially Russell's brigade, short of transport, was delegated to protect lines of communication. By 26 November it was moving to the front. By mid December the brigade was involved in intense fighting against the armour of Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps at Alem Hamsa where the 1st Battalion, Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) were destroyed as a fighting unit and were temporarily replaced by 1st Battalion, 6th Rajputana Rifles.In March 1942 4th Indian Division was dispersed and the brigade was sent to Palestine but hastily summoned back to the western desert after Rommel's breakthrough at the Battle of Gazala. Initially attached to 5th Indian Division, the brigade was transferred to 10th Indian Infantry Division as it withdrew from Libya to the defensive position at Mersa Matruh in Egypt. On 28 June the brigade found its line of withdrawal from Metrsa Matruh cut and was forced to break out southwards into the desert in small parties before turning east and reforming behind the defensive position at El Alamein. For his leadership of the brigade in the period from November 1941 to April 1942 Russell was awarded in September 1942 the DSO.Having reorganised, the brigade was once more attached to 5th Indian Division and during mid July fought in the battles of Ruweisat Ridge, part of series of engagements now called the First Battle of El Alamein. The brigade continued to hold positions on or near the Ruweisat Ridge up to November and the Second Battle of El Alamein. By this time 5th Indian Division had been relieved and the brigade was once more part of 4th Indian Division. For his services between May and October Russell was mentioned in dispatches.4th Indian Division's initial role in the second Alamein battle was to make diversionary displays from Ruweisat Ridge while the main offensive went into the north. In early November the 2nd New Zealand Division had made a salient into the Axis lines and 5th Indian Brigade were attached to the exhausted 51st (Highland) Infantry Division to complete the breakthrough. By dawn on 4 November the brigade had secured its objectives opening the way for the British armour.\n\nIraq and Syria\nIn January 1943 Russell was appointed acting major-general and appointed to command 8th Indian Infantry Division in Iraq. When the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad removed the threat to Iraq and Persia from the Caucasus the division was moved to Syria for training. In June 1943 the division was ordered to seize the island of Rhodes but the armistice with Italy forestalled the operation.\n\nItaly\nIn September 1943 the division landed in Taranto in southern Italy, destined to become engaged for the rest of the war fighting on the Italian Front. For the next three months the division fought up the eastern side of Italy as part of Eighth Army's V Corps, making crossings of the rivers Biferno, Trigno and in late November the Sangro. By mid-December they had crossed the Moro but General Sir Bernard Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander, called off offensive operations as deteriorating winter weather and conditions underfoot made further attacks impractical and 8th Indian Division were tasked to hold the front between Orsogna and the Apennine Mountains.At the beginning of May 1944, 8th Indian Division had been attached to XIII Corps and switched in secrecy across the Apennines to the mouth of the Liri valley beneath Monte Cassino for the fourth Battle of Monte Cassino, Operation Diadem. 8th Indian and British 4th Division were given the job to get across the fast-flowing Rapido river and establish bridgeheads. The attack went in on the night of 11 May and by 09.00 the next morning Russell's divisional engineers had erected a Bailey bridge to allow supporting armour into the bridgehead to repel German armoured counterattacks. By 13 May the Germans fell back and 1st Canadian Infantry Division passed through the bridgehead to lead the advance. 8th Indian Division now came under X Corps for a 150-mile advance before being rested at the end of June. In August 1944 Russell was awarded the CBE.After three weeks' rest the division re-joined XIII Corps, which by this time formed the right wing of the U.S. Fifth Army, under Mark Clark, to liberate Florence before moving into the central Apennines and advance north east to confront the Gothic Line. Monte Citerna on the Gothic line was taken on 9 September but this only heralded another two and a half months fighting, making slow progress in poor conditions and wild terrain.In late 1944, as Eighth Army ground its way forward across the division's front from the right, the Germans withdrew from 8th Indian Division's sector to shorten their front line and lines of communication. In late December Russell was ordered to take two brigades to the far western wing of the Fifth Army where the inexperienced U.S. 92nd Infantry Division was thought by the new Fifth Army commander, Lieutenant General Lucian K. Truscott, to be very vulnerable. On 26 December the Germans broke through towards Russell's rearguard positions but the attack was not carried through and 8th Indian Division recovered the lost ground. The division was then withdrawn to rest at Pisa.On 8 February Indian Division was moved to the Adriatic front once more to join Eighth Army's V Corps once again and take up positions on the river Senio. The main attack on the Senio started on 9 April 1945. By the evening 8th Indian Division, with the New Zealanders on their left, had in furious fighting against desperate defence created a bridgehead one and a half miles deep. On 11 April they made a strongly opposed crossing of the river Santerno before allowing the British 78th Division to pass through into the Argenta Gap. After a brief pause for rest, during which time 78th Division and British 56th Division had forced the Argenta Gap defences, 8th Indian Division were put back in the front line to take Ferrara and be the first Eighth Army formation to reach the river Po. After crossing the Po the division crossed the river Adige on 28 April and was ordered to halt.Following the formal cessation of hostilities on 2 May, 8 Indian Division was repatriated to India during June. Russell's temporary rank of major-general was made substantive in November and he was appointed Companion of the Bath (CB). He was also mentioned in despatches and received the United States Legion of Merit, Degree of Commander.\n\nPost war\nThe 8th Indian Division was disbanded in April 1946 and Russell was appointed to command 5th Indian Division. In 1947 Russell became C-in-C Delhi and East Punjab Command in the acting rank of lieutenant-general before in 1948 becoming Chief Advisor to the Indian Army. He was knighted KBE in the 1950 New Year's honours list at the request of the Indian government and retired in July 1954 retaining the honorary rank of lieutenant-general.\n\nPersonal\nHe married Elizabeth Birket in 1929.\n\nHonours and decorations\nKnight Commander of the Order of the British Empire 2 January 1950 (CBE 31 August 1944, OBE, 30 December 1941)\nCompanion of the Order of the Bath 5 June 1945\nDistinguished Service Order 9 September 1942\nMilitary Cross 8 March 1919\nMention in Despatches 24 June 1943, 23 June 1945\nCommander, Legion of Merit (United States) 2 August 1945\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nWale Adebanwi\nWale Adebanwi (born 1969) is a Nigerian-born first Black Rhodes Professor at St Antony's College, Oxford where he was, until June 2021, a Professor of Race Relations, and the Director of the African Studies Centre, School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies, and a Governing Board Fellow.

He began his career in the War of the Austrian Succession at the age of 14. Courten fought in the Spanish\u2013Portuguese War (1761\u20131763), the Invasion of Algiers in 1775, and the Great Siege of Gibraltar. He was the last Spanish governor of Oran in 1792. As a lieutenant general, he led an infantry division during the War of the Pyrenees against the First French Republic in several actions including Perpignan, Peyrestortes, Truillas, Boulou, and the Black Mountain. He was appointed Captain General of Aragon in 1795.\n\nEarly career\nBorn on 10 October 1730, in Tortosa, Courten hailed from a family that migrated to Spain from the Valais, in present-day Switzerland. His father was Brigadier General Jean-Etienne Amand de Courten, a military engineer. In 1692, his grandfather Amand de Courten had married Anne Judith Herreford, the daughter of a rich English merchant, and the couple had three sons. Amand was killed in the Siege of Venlo on 13 September 1702, during the War of the Spanish Succession. Jean-Etienne Amand was born in 1695 in Dunkirk and went to the Royal Military Academy in Barcelona in 1719 to study engineering. He married Ana Antonio Gonzales in 1726 and was killed in the siege of Tortona on 3 September 1745, during the War of the Austrian Succession.\nJuan Antonio de Courten joined the Spanish army at the age of 12 and served in the Walloon Guards Regiment. He became an ensign on 11 January 1744 while in garrison at Rimini. He participated in the War of the Austrian Succession, fighting at the Battle of Velletri on 12 August 1744 and the Battle of Piacenza on 16 June 1746. He was also present at the sieges of Alessandria, Tortona, and Valenza during this period. On 13 August 1746 he became a second lieutenant. Promotion to first lieutenant came on 22 September 1754 and the following year he was appointed adjutant major of an artillery detachment.Courten served in the Spanish\u2013Portuguese War of 1761 to 1763. He was promoted to captain on 14 May 1768. In 1775 Courten took part in the Invasion of Algiers, a humiliating defeat of the Spanish army at the hands of the Moors. Because of public anger at the disaster, the officers who were involved were disgraced and posted far from the royal court. Officers whose reputations suffered in the debacle were Alejandro O'Reilly, Antonio Ricardos, Luis Firm\u00edn de Carvajal, Conde de la Uni\u00f3n, Jer\u00f3nimo Gir\u00f3n-Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarillas, Domingo Izquierdo, Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana, and Ventura Caro. These men banded together in a secret society within the military to push for modernization. Courten was a member of this group.Courten fought under Ventura Caro in the Great Siege of Gibraltar which lasted from 1779 to 1783. He was elevated in rank to brigadier general on 1 January 1783 and to mariscal de campo on 14 January 1789. With the temporary rank of lieutenant general, he was put in command of the Walloon Guards. Courten was the last Spanish governor of Oran. He commanded from 4 November 1790 to 17 February 1792. On that date the port passed into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. Oran had been under Spanish control since 1732. Courten followed royal orders to evacuate Oran, removing all Spanish property accumulated during the long occupation.\n\nWar of the Pyrenees\nPromoted to teniente general, Courten played a prominent role in the War of the Pyrenees against the First French Republic which began in 1793. The army commander Ricardos had a good opinion of Courten's military competence and entrusted him with important commands. He led the 1st, 2nd, and 6th Battalions of the Walloon Guards in the Battle of Perpignan on 17 July 1793. His troops acquitted themselves well in this unsuccessful action. On 17 September 1793 he fought at the Battle of Peyrestortes. The French attacked his division in its camp at Le Vernet and forced it to retreat with a loss of 1,200 soldiers, 26 guns, and seven colors. He played a notable part in the Spanish victory at the Battle of Truillas five days later. At Truillas, 24,000 French attacked in the morning but were stopped. Don Juan Courten and the Count de la Union led an infantry counterattack that helped win the battle. The French lost 1,500 prisoners and 10 artillery pieces.After directing his troops in an action at the Col de Banyuls on 14 December, the 63-year-old general became ill. He fought in the Battle of Boulou in late April and early May 1794. In October 1794 an order of battle listed Teniente General Courten as commanding the following units. They were two battalions of the Burgos Line Infantry Regiment, one battalion each of the Principe Line Infantry, Granada Militia, and Voluntarios de Tarragona Light Infantry, the first battalions of the Espa\u00f1a, Extremadura, Granada, Malaga, and Savoia Line Infantry, and one company of Granaderos de Cordoba.Courten commanded the left wing at the Battle of the Black Mountain. On 17 and 18 November 1794 Pierre Augereau's French division defeated Courten and forced his troops to withdraw. The climax of the battle came on 20 November when the French overran the Roure redoubt in the center and put the Spanish army to flight. Both army commanders were killed in the hard-fought action, Conde de la Uni\u00f3n and Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Dugommier. In 1795 Courten was appointed Captain General of Aragon. He died near Zaragoza on 21 December 1796.\n\nFamily\nThe Curten family was originally from Italy but moved to Switzerland where they settled near the Simplon Pass. By charging tolls on travelers they became wealthy and built a castle in the Valais canton. Later they altered the family name to Courten. The family was important enough that they raised a regiment of mercenary Swiss soldiers to serve in the French royal army. This arrangement continued until the Swiss regiments were suppressed by the French Legislative Assembly on 20 August 1792. In 1789 the De Courten Regiment Nr. 88 was commanded by Antoine-Pancrace, Comt\u00e9 de Courten who was born on 6 October 1720 and died later that year on 27 November. Other leading officers were Joseph Hyacinthe Elie and Charles de Preux. After 1792 the regiment was taken into the army of King Charles IV of Spain. In 1808 the Spanish army included the Preux Swiss Regiment Nr. 6 with 1,708 men in two battalions. The unit was stationed at Madrid.A younger Juan de Courten was promoted to mariscal de campo in 1810 and commanded troops at the Siege of Tarragona in May and June 1811.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son.

They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 9:\nMaximiliano Serrano\nMaximiliano Serrano (born 5 August 1988) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a midfielder.\n\nCareer\nDefensores de Belgrano were Serrano's first club.

The label was headquartered in New York City. Biltmore Records were often reissues of recordings no longer in the catalogues of other labels. When RCA Victor found out that Biltmore were making unauthorized reissues of material originally recorded by Victor, they sued Biltmore, putting Biltmore out of business.\nThey rereleased recordings by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra recorded for Columbia and Brunswick, Benny Goodman, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, Duke Ellington, Bix Beiderbecke, and Paul Whiteman.\n\nExternal links\nBiltmore Numerical Listing: http:\/\/www.78discography.com\/Biltmore.htm\n\nSee also\nList of record labels\nPassage 5:\nGraeme Goodall\nGraeme Goodall (1932 \u2013 3 December 2014) was an Australian recording engineer and record label owner who was a key figure in the early days of Jamaica's recording industry, constructing several of the Island's studios, co-founding Island Records, and operating other labels in the United Kingdom releasing Jamaican music.\n\nCareer\nBorn in 1932, Graeme Goodall grew up in Caulfield, Victoria, and studied at Caulfield North Central School and Scotch College. In the early 1950s he worked at Melbourne radio station 3UZ briefly before studying television in London and training as an engineer with the International Broadcasting Company.He became involved in the independent record industry and travelled to Jamaica in 1954 to set up the first FM radio network in Kingston \u2014 Radio Jamaica Rediffusion. He went on to work as chief engineer of the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation.He began recording local musicians at the Radio Jamaica studios, and went on to build Federal Records, Jamaica's first recording studio (which was rebuilt in 1961 and later became Tuff Gong Recording Studio) with local entrepreneur Ken Khouri to the rear of Khouri's furniture store on King Street. Goodall worked as a recording engineer for Ken Khouri on some of the earliest Jamaican studio recordings. The studio not only provided the Island's first recording facility but also produced acetate discs, allowing sound system operators to record tracks and have them available to play within hours.Known to the local musicians as \"Mr. Goody\", Goddall went on to assist with the construction of several studios, including Dynamic Sound, Studio One and later Channel One Studios, and carry out engineering work for producers such as Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd, Byron Lee, and Leslie Kong, engineering recordings by Laurel Aitken (\"Boogie in My Bones\") Millie (\"My Boy Lollipop\"), The Wailers, Prince Buster, The Skatalites, Derrick Morgan, and Desmond Dekker, among many others. He also trained Jamaican engineers such as Sylvan Morris and Lynford Anderson.In 1959 he co-founded Island Records with Chris Blackwell and Kong, but his relationship with Blackwell broke down and he went on to start his own labels after relocating to the UK in 1965, the most successful of which were Doctor Bird and Pyramid. After Dekker's \"Poor Me, Israelites\" proved popular in clubs but failed to get much airplay due to its production, Goodall got Kong to send him the master tapes; he remixed it and released it in the UK in 1969 on Pyramid as \"Israelites\", the single going on to top the UK Singles Chart and sell over two million copies. He also ran West Indies Records and set up the Trojan Records subsidiary Attack Records.Goodall married his Jamaican wife Fay in 1961 and in the early 1970s they moved to the US. Goodall later worked as Southern Regional Manager for Sony Pro Audio.Graeme Goodall died at his home in Atlanta, Georgia on 3 December 2014 from natural causes, aged 82. He was survived by his wife, two children, and four grandchildren.\nPassage 6:\nExit 13\nExit 13 is the thirteenth studio album by American rapper LL Cool J. It was released on September 9, 2008, on the record label Def Jam Recordings. This would be his last album release with the label.\n\nProduction\nThis album is the first LL Cool J album since G.O.A.T. to have the parental advisory label for explicit lyrics.  LL said in an interview with Chicago radio personality DJ Z that the vulgarities are not heavy and the edited version has alternate lyrics rather than simply omitting the vulgarities. LL and DJ Kayslay teamed up to release his first mixtape as a prelude to Exit 13 titled  The Return of the G.O.A.T..\nOther contributors for this album include 50 Cent, Sheek Louch, Fat Joe, Ryan Leslie, Wyclef Jean, The-Dream, Lil Mo, KRS-One, Funkmaster Flex, Richie Sambora and Darlisa Blackshere.\n\nSingles\nA buzz single titled, \"Cry,\" featuring Lil' Mo, was released as a digital download and international 12\" single on June 17, 2008. The unofficial street single, \"Rockin' with the G.O.A.T.,\" premiered on June 20, 2008.\nThe first official single, \"Baby\" featuring The-Dream was released on July 1, 2008, to the iTunes Music Store. On August 19, 2008, iTunes released the rock remix featuring Richie Sambora, lead guitarist of rock band Bon Jovi, with a rock rhythm and a sped-up tempo.\nThe second official single, \"Feel My Heart Beat\" featuring 50 Cent was released on August 26, 2008. The song did not enter the Billboard Hot 100. The official single version of the song was leaked to the Internet on November 27, 2008.\n\nCritical reception\nExit 13 garnered mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 57, based on 5 reviews.Despite being too lengthy and containing lesser tracks like \"American Girl\", Jesal Padania of RapReviews praised the album for having a consistent sound of instruments and synths in the tracks and LL's strong lyricism, saying that \"In other words, all that effort that LL finally put into Exit 13 has really paid off - and he is getting the best revenge of all... Showing Def Jam what they will be missing.\" Steve Jones of USA Today called it LL's \"most aggressive album in years,\" praising his standard braggadocio and lady-swooning content for being consistently energetic because of an amalgam of young up-and-coming producers, concluding that \"After 10 straight platinum albums, his last two have only gone gold. But he seems to have gotten his swagger back. He may be hitting the Exit, but he is not easing up on the gas.\"In The New York Times, Jon Pareles felt that LL more than holds his own with the sounds delivered by newer producers that lift his old-school meets new-school lyricism, concluding with, \"To his credit, LL Cool J is too romantic to treat women as crudely as younger rappers do. And while this 76-minute album flags near the end, there's still more than enough smooth-tongued, quick-witted rhyming to justify his boasts.\" AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that despite tracks like \"You Better Watch Me\" and \"This Is Ring Tone M...\" that show LL at his best, he criticized the record for being too try-hard in sounding like the mainstream rap albums released that year, concluding that \"Out with a whimper, not a bang, Exit 13 is an off-ramp leading to a boulevard of several mismanaged White Castle knock-offs.\"\n\nChart performance\nExit 13 debuted and peaked at number nine on the US Billboard 200 in the week of September 27, 2008, selling 44,000 copies in its first week of release. By October 2008, it had sold 80,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Exit 13 would become LL Cool J's final album with Def Jam. In regards to the album's reception and lack of proper marketing, the he stated in 2009: \"The record just really honestly, you know, didn't have that support that I wish it would have had. [I] can't blame anyone. It was my last record, and I guess for whatever reason, whether it was quality or business, you know, the company just decided that they were going to write it off and not really give it that shot.\"\n\nTrack listing\nSample credits\n\n\"Dear Hip Hop\"\n\"I'm Still a Struggling Man\" by Edwin Starr\n\"Cry\"\n\"Half a Man\" by Bunny Sigler\n\"I Cry\" by Ja Rule feat.

Takara recorded 5 studio albums for several different record labels in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Founding member and lead guitarist Neal Grusky, and bassist Carl Demarco remained permanent fixtures in the band since its early days.\n\nBiography\n1980s - Early Days\nTakara was formed in August 1987. After a few months of rehearsals the band made their debut in October with a show in Hollywood, California. The band proceeded to play many more shows throughout 1987-88. In November 1988, Takara went into the studio to record their first demo with producer Jeff Scott Soto. As they entered the studio it became apparent that the original singer was not ready to record. In order to finish the new Takara demo, Soto was asked to help out by providing vocals for the demo. This was the beginning of a long relationship between the band and Jeff Scott Soto.\n\n1990s - The Soto Era\nIn 1990, Takara went back into the studio to record what would eventually become their debut album, Eternal Faith. In 1992 Takara regrouped and added new members who would perform in Eternal Faith. The line-up was ultimately completed with Jeff Scott Soto on vocals, Neal Grusky on guitar, Gary Schutt on bass and Bob Duda on drums. In August 1993, Zero Corporation (Japan) and Now and Then records (Europe) offered Takara a deal to release Eternal Faith in December 1993.\nAfter a short break the band began to work on what was to become their second album. Before rehearsals began, bassist Carl Demarco replaced Schutt and they returned to the studio to record Taste of Heaven. The band enlisted Bob Daisley on bass for guest performances on two songs. Taste of Heaven was released in May 1995 by Zero Corporation (Japan) and Long Island records (Europe). Upon its release, Taste of Heaven had commercial success, and Long Island records brought Takara to Germany for a promo tour.\nIn 1996 Saraya Recordings, a new US label, asked permission to re-release Eternal Faith and Taste of Heaven as its first releases. Feeling that there was momentum starting to build, the band wasted no time in working on their third album. In 1998 they released Blind in Paradise through Zero Corporation (Japan), Point Music (Europe), and Saraya Recordings (US). Shortly after the release of \u2018Blind in Paradise\u2019, all of Takara's labels released a greatest hits album Eternity: Best of 93 - 98.\n\n2000-2010 Changes to the Lineup\nIn late 1998, the Takara went through significant lineup changes, leaving only guitarist\/band leader Neal Grusky and bassist Carl Demarco to rebuild begin writing new material. The band found drummer Chad Clark and keyboardist Brook Hansen. Brook and Neal had known each other for years and always shared similar ideas on music. The last to come aboard was vocalist Michael J. Flatters, who Grusky found through a mutual friend. With the band complete, Takara re-entered the studio in February 2000 to record their fourth album, Perception of Reality. One year later, it was completed and released on the Avalon Marquee (Japan), Lion Music (Europe), and Metal Mayhem (US) labels.\nAfter a hiatus of several years, Grusky decided to reform Takara in 2008, once again with a new lineup. This lineup saw the arrival of several new members including Bjorn Englen (bass), Patrick Johannson (drums), and vocalist Gus Monsanto. Keyboardist Brook Hansen returned to the lineup. Jeff Scott Soto also returned after ten years to provide harmony vocals for the resulting 2008 album entitled Invitation to Forever. This album, released by Progrock Records, marked a turning point for Takara with Grusky taking his powerful songwriting to a much harder edge than on previous Takara albums. The album subsequently gained mass approval by fans and progressive rock critics alike.\n\n2011-2019 Final Lineup and First Live Performances\nAfter the release of Invitation To Forever guitarist and bandleader Neal Grusky was faced with some tough decisions. Feeling that the band had gone too far in the direction of a studio project with hired musicians contributing internationally, he opted to change the lineup once again in hopes of finding fresh local talent willing to pursue the local LA club scene. Grusky brought back Carl Demarco now \"Carla DeMarco\" \"on bass, reuniting the core of Takara. After a long search for a suitable vocal talent, the band found Jamie Kelli, who had been regularly performing in the LA area. Drummer Gene McEwen, also active in the local scene, completed the lineup. With Kelli filling in temporarily on keyboards, Takara proceeded to prepare for a series of live shows intended to re-introduce the modern LA rock scene to both new and old material from the band. On October 30, 2010, Takara's new lineup performed their first live show to showcase new vocalist Jamie Kelli at Paladino's in Los Angeles, California.  In October 2011, Takara announced they would be contributing a song to a Randy Rhoads\/Ozzy Osbourne tribute album which was released in the spring of 2012 by Versailles Records. Takara recorded a version of the song \"Little Dolls\" from the 1981 album \"Diary of a Madman\".\nIn 2019, Grusky announced that the then current members of Takara would be moving on to alternate projects, and that for the time being Takara would no longer be active. Neal Grusky went on to form the LA progressive metal band Prey For Sunday, releasing their first self titled EP in 2021. Vocalist Jamie Kelli relocated to the Boston area where he has since formed the hard rock band Jasper Lane, releasing their debut self titled album in September 2020.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n1993 - Eternal Faith\n1995 - Taste of Heaven\n1998 - Blind in Paradise\n2001 - Perception of Reality\n2008 - Invitation to Forever\n\nCompilations\n1998 - Eternity: Best of 93 \u2013 98\n\nRelated Projects\nTalisman\nW.E.T.\nPrey For Sunday\nSoul Sign\nJasper Lane\nPassage 12:\nEquity Music Group\nEquity Music Group was an American country music record label founded in 2003 by singer Clint Black.

Recording was finished by March 2009, and the album was later released on June 9, 2009, through Victory Records. A music video for the song \"The Curtain Hits the Cast\" from Requiem was released.For the band's fourth studio album, The Autumn Offering took their music in a heavier direction contrasting the more pop and melody driven Fear Will Cast No Shadow. The album was described by the band as a more \"mature\" album featuring \"longer songs, complex rhythms, and dynamic vocals.\" Further distancing themselves from their previous album, vocalist Matt McChesney wrote darker lyrics about substance abuse and being raised in a broken home, as opposed to songs about relationships. The song \"Narcosis\" is about McChesney's experience of being revived with an adrenaline shot after snorting heroin and cocaine at the same time.Requiem became The Autumn Offering's first charting album, peaking at number 36 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart.\n\nThe Autumn Offering (2010)\nFor the band's fifth studio album, The Autumn Offering recruited two members: guitarist Jesse Nunn of Silent Civilian and Scum of the Earth who replaced Matt Johnson, and bassist Carl Bensley of Instinct of Aggression who replaced Mike Poggione.The Autumn Offering was released on August 31, 2010, through Victory Records. The album featured another stylistic change for the band, this time going into a more melodic death metal and deathcore direction. Late that year, following the departure of guitarist Tommy Church, vocalist Matt McChesney stated that the band would be ending, citing burn out and \"a million other things.\"\n\nBand members\nCurrent membersCarl Bensley \u2013 bass guitar (2010)\nTommy Church \u2013 guitars (2005\u20132010) (ex-Mushroomhead)\nMatt McChesney \u2013 vocals (2007\u20132010) (ex-Hell Within)\nJesse Nunn (Saint) \u2013 guitars (2010)\nBrian Sculley \u2013 drums (2008\u20132010)Former membersTony Cesaro \u2013 guitars (1999\u20132002)\nMike Bortle \u2013 drums (1999\u20132003)\nGeorge Moore \u2013 guitars (1999\u20132005) (ex-Trivium)\nDennis Miller \u2013 vocals (1999\u20132007)\nNick Gelyon \u2013 drums (2003\u20132007)\nJonathon Lee \u2013 drums (2007)\nAllen Royal \u2013 drums (2007-2008)\nSean Robbins \u2013 bass guitar  (1999\u20132008)\nMike Poggione \u2013 bass guitar, vocals (2008\u20132009)\nErik Tisinger - bass guitar  (2009)\nMatt Johnson \u2013 guitars (1999\u20132010)Timeline\n\nDiscography\nStudio albumsRevelations of the Unsung (2004)\nEmbrace the Gutter (2006)\nFear Will Cast No Shadow (2007)\nRequiem (2009)\nThe Autumn Offering (2010)\n\nMusic videos\nPassage 15:\nMona Bone Jakon\nMona Bone Jakon is the third studio album by singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, released in April 1970 on the Island Records label in the United Kingdom and on A&M in the United States and Canada.\n\nOverview\nAfter a meteoric start to his career, surprising even his original producer at Deram Records with the hit singles \"I Love My Dog\", \"Matthew and Son\", and \"I'm Gonna Get Me a Gun\", Stevens' debut album, Matthew and Son, began charting. However, after the pressure for a repeat album of the same calibre, Stevens, considered a young teen sensation, was overwhelmed by a new lifestyle as well as the demands of writing, recording, performing, publicity appearances, and touring. His second album was a commercial failure and in the autumn of 1968, he was hospitalized, with a diagnosis of tuberculosis and a collapsed lung. For over a year, while recovering, Stevens virtually disappeared from the British pop scene. Mona Bone Jakon is notable not only for his return but for the emergence of a very different artist. The album sold slowly (at first) but over time has been certified Gold for sales\/shipments of more than 500,000 copies in the United States.\n\nBackground\nDuring his hospital-dictated year of bedrest, Stevens began writing a catalogue of songs to fill far more than his next album. After his recovery, he negotiated out of his contract with Deram Records and worked with former Yardbirds bassist Paul Samwell-Smith on a stripped-down sound. In contrast to his first two albums, these new songs were sparse arrangements. They were played on acoustic guitars and keyboards and accompanied by a smaller backing band, consisting of three other performers: second guitarist Alun Davies, bassist John Ryan, and drummer Harvey Burns\u2014and on one song, \"Katmandu\", Peter Gabriel on the flute. Samwell-Smith also produced the album and brought Stevens a high-fidelity sound that was not as present on his previous releases. Samwell-Smith was one of the early producers in rock to push the lower bass frequencies more prominently into the mix in an attempt to keep up with the new audiophile generation, which was embracing larger home speakers and high-end phonographic cartridges. Stevens began to make the transition from pop musician to a folk-rock performer when the term \"singer-songwriter\" was just being coined.The songs themselves were darker in tone: the madrigal-inspired ballad \"Lady D'Arbanville\" elevated the tragedy of a lost lover (in this case, Stevens' former girlfriend Patti D'Arbanville) to that of a deceased one and \"Trouble\" was a plea to stave off death. There were also lighter songs: \"Pop Star\" showcased Stevens' dramatic change in voice by satirising the triviality of celebrity.\nThough \"Lady D'Arbanville\" would reach No. 8 on the British charts, Mona Bone Jakon was only a modest success upon its initial release. The album attracted attention, however, in the wake of the commercial breakthrough of its follow-up, Tea for the Tillerman, and with the inclusion of three of its songs (\"Trouble\", \"I Wish, I Wish\", and \"I Think I See the Light\") in Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins's 1971 black comedy, Harold and Maude.\n\nOrigin of title\nAccording to a 1972 interview with Stevens, the inspiration for the title was a name he created to describe his penis: \"'Mona Bone Jakon' is another name for my penis. It's the name I give it. It's not some sort of secret vocabulary, it's just something I made up.\"Journalist Robert Chalmers reiterated this point for a 2003 interview with Yusuf Islam for The Independent on Sunday when he wrote: \"When [Stevens] re-emerged in 1969, he had more than 40 new songs and released three triumphant albums in 15 months on Chris Blackwell's Island label: Mona Bone Jakon (his pet word for penis), Tea for the Tillerman and Teaser and the Firecat.\"\n\nCritical reception\nIn a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+, noting that \"this one has a nice post-creative trauma feel, intimate and sensitive. Recommended to singer\/songwriter specialists.\" Later, he revised his review to a B- and expressed a newfound dislike for the songs \"Lady D'Arbanville,\" \"Trouble,\" and \"I Wish, I Wish\".In a retrospective review, Allmusic's William Ruhlmann gave it four out of five stars and called it \"a group of simple, heartfelt songs played in spare arrangements on acoustic guitars and keyboards and driven by a restrained rhythm section\". He added that \"Stevens' craggy voice, with its odd breaks of tone and occasional huskiness, lent these sometimes sketchy songs depth\".\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCat Stevens \u2013 acoustic guitar, classical guitar, keyboards, vocals\nAlun Davies \u2013 acoustic guitar, backing vocals\nJohn Ryan \u2013 double bass\nHarvey Burns \u2013 drums, percussion\nPeter Gabriel \u2013 flute on \"Katmandu\"\nDel Newman \u2013 strings, arrangements\n\nProduction\nProducer \u2013 Paul Samwell-Smith\nEngineer \u2013 Michael Bobak\nMixing \u2013 Paul Hicks\nSupervisor \u2013 Bill Levenson\nCoordinator \u2013 Beth Stempel\nMastering \u2013 Ted Jensen\nDesign \u2013 Roland Young, Mike Diehl\nIllustrations \u2013 Cat Stevens\nPhotography \u2013 Grazia Neri, Richard Stirling\n\nCharts\nCertifications and sales\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 16:\nTrevor Wyatt\nTrevor Wyatt is a British record company manager and record producer.\nWyatt was Chris Blackwell's first employee at Island Records London. Trevor drove the Island cab, delivering records to the stores as well as taking the artists around when they came to town. As Island grew, Trevor became the studio manager, UK A&R manager, and house producer, first in Island's Basing Street Studios and then at Island's HQ at St Peter's Square in Hammersmith. As such, he became a source of knowledge on who had recorded what in the studio and where their sessions could be found. Many compilations on the Island label existed purely because Trevor found material in the archives and brought it to the appropriate label manager's attention. He was responsible for the Island Reggae Greats series of releases, and also found many alternate takes and demos for box sets by Nick Drake and Sandy Denny.\nAfter the takeover by Universal Records, Wyatt followed Blackwell to Palm Pictures, where he worked for some years. He is now an independent artist manager.\nPassage 17:\nNecessary Records\nNecessary Records is a record label based in the UK, founded by Warren Clarke, a former A&R executive at London Records and Edel, in 2003. Clarke describes that the label was born out of a creative necessity. \"It's an outlet for records that should and must be heard. An outlet for artists that deserve to and will, touch the widest possible audience.\"It is most notable for being the record label of English indie rock band Hard-FiThe label was responsible for the release of Hard Fi's debut album, Stars of CCTV, before the label secured a two album worldwide licensing deal with Atlantic, which saw the album re-released in the UK and subsequently nominated for a Mercury Prize and two Brit Awards. The album also peaked at #1 in the UK albums chart in January 2006, reaching sales of 1.2 million copies worldwide, with over 830,000 in the UK alone. The band's second album, Once Upon a Time in the West, released by Necessary\/Atlantic, also reached #1 on the UK album charts. The band's third album, Killer Sounds, released by Necessary\/Atlantic went to #9 on the UK album charts.Necessary also have a publishing and management company.\n\nArtist roster\nNights\nDistophia\nHard-Fi\nMaupa\n\nSee also\nList of record labels\nPassage 18:\nSuper Grit Cowboy Band\nSuper Grit Cowboy Band is an American country music band formed in North Carolina. It was founded by Clyde Mattocks, Libby Mattocks, Bill Lyerly, Danny Vinson, Dave Cavanaugh  and Alfred Ward. Active since 1974, the band recorded first with Sound Hut Studios. Beginning with their 1981 album, the band has recorded on its own Hoodswamp label.\n\nHistory\nThe band formed in 1974, comprising Clyde Mattocks (steel guitar, Dobro, banjo, electric guitar), Danny Vinson (drums), Mike Kinzie (fiddle, saxophone, piano, harmonica, acoustic guitar), Bill Ellis (bass guitar, keyboards) and Curtis Wright (lead guitar).The band recorded their first album in 1977 featuring Bill Lyerly (Bill Lyerly Band).\nLater the band recorded for its own label, Hoodswamp Records, and released three albums on it. In 1981, the band charted for the first time on Hot Country Songs with \"If You Don't Know Me by Now,\" which reached No. 71. Between then and 1983, four more of the band's singles reached the country charts, including its highest-charting, the No. 48 \"She Is the Woman.\" Billboard gave the band's 1981 album If You Can't Hang a positive review, praising the instrumentation as well as the rock influences.At one point, Don Cox was a member of the band. He later recorded All Over Town for Step One Records and charted at No. 29 on the country music charts with its title track. Wright later joined Vern Gosdin's road band, of which he was a member until 1989. After quitting that band, Wright was a solo artist for Airborne and Liberty Records, charting in the Top 40 with \"She's Got a Man on Her Mind\" in 1990 and releasing a self-titled album in 1992. He later recorded one album with Robert Ellis Orrall in the duo Orrall & Wright, then joined Shenandoah from 2000 to 2008. Wright has also written singles for Shenandoah, Ronnie Milsap, Daryle Singletary, and Carolina Rain.\nSince 2010, the band has consisted of Mattocks and Kinzie, along with guitarist Mark Golladay, drummer Dexter Horton and bass guitarist Carroll Wade.\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nSingles\nPassage 19:\nRaised on Radio\nRaised on Radio is the ninth studio album by the American rock band Journey, released in April 1986 on the Columbia Records label. It is the first album to not feature founding bassist Ross Valory, who was replaced initially by session bassist Bob Glaub and then by  Randy Jackson. Drummer Steve Smith contributed to a few tracks, but was replaced during the recording by session drummer Larrie Londin and then Mike Baird for the subsequent tour.\nThe album spawned three top 20 singles in the US: \"Girl Can't Help It\" (No. 17), \"I'll Be Alright Without You\" (No. 14), and \"Suzanne\" (No. 17). It also spawned a top ten single \"Be Good to Yourself\" (No. 9) It went to No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart, and it was certified double platinum in the USA.\n\nBackground\nRaised on Radio was released three years after Frontiers (1983). In 1984, both lead guitarist Neal Schon and lead singer Steve Perry released albums on their own; Schon in the band HSAS (Through the Fire), and Perry with his debut solo album, Street Talk. Perry considered leaving Journey following the release of Street Talk which he has referred to as \"one of the most fun experiences I've had\". Perry decided to return to working with Journey when he received a call from keyboardist Jonathan Cain, who wanted him to work on some unfinished songs.Following Perry's return to Journey, he began to take more control over the band's direction. Bassist Ross Valory and drummer Steve Smith were fired from the band, against the wishes of manager Herbie Herbert. According to Perry, Valory and Smith \"weren't pleased with the kind of music we were playing and weren't too keen on touring\". Smith later said of the initial recording process: \"There was a lot of pressure to do it the way Steve Perry wanted, which I had a lot of problems with because I felt it should be a group record, like all the other records.\" Valory was replaced by Randy Jackson (bass guitar) and Smith was replaced by session musician Larrie Londin (drums). In the VH-1 Behind the Music episode featuring the band, Perry expressed regret over his decision, stating he'd have done things differently. Smith did record three tracks with Journey on the album, and he and Valory still received revenues from the record and subsequent tour. Both returned to Journey in 1995.\nThe band decided that Perry, who had proved his production capabilities on Street Talk, was the best fit to produce the album. According to Perry, this gave the rest of the band members as much creative control as possible: \"Journey knows what it should sound like, so we all agreed I would be a good, safe, nondictator-type producer.\"Perry changed the original title of this project from Freedom to Raised on Radio, which drew the ire of Herbert and some of the band members, as it varied from the one-word general theme in most of their previous albums. The band would end up using the Freedom title 36 years later for their fifteenth studio album.\nThe subsequent tour featured Schon, Perry, Cain, and Jackson, with drummer Mike Baird .\n\nArtwork\nThe cover of the album (by Prairie Prince, an early member of the band) was modeled after the studios and antennas for KNGS in Hanford, California, which was owned by Perry's parents, Ray and Mary Perry.\n\nSongs\nCash Box said of \"Suzanne\" that \"Somewhat brooding verses give way to explosive choruses which feature Steve Perry\u2019s potent singing\" and that \"Journey has captured the essence of teen romance.\" Billboard said of it that Journey's \"power rock style gets adapted just a bit here toward the techno-dance idiom.\"Cash Box said of \"Why Can't This Night Go On Forever\" that it's a \"rousing, emotional ballad is pure Journey\" with a \"bracing, high-wire vocal\" from Steve Perry.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits for Raised on Radio adapted from liner notes.Journey\n\nSteve Perry \u2013 lead vocals\nJonathan Cain \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals\nNeal Schon \u2013 guitars, guitar synthesizer, backing vocals, keyboards (10)\nRandy Jackson \u2013 bass (all tracks except 2, 10 and 11), backing vocals (all tracks except 2, 10 and 11)\nSteve Smith \u2013 drums (2, 10 and 11)Additional musicians\n\nBob Glaub \u2013 bass (2, 10 and 11)\nLarrie Londin \u2013 drums (all tracks except 2, 10 and 11)\nMike Baird \u2013 drums (12 and 13) (2006 CD reissue only)\nSteve Minkins \u2013 percussion (3)\nDanny Hull (credited as Dan Hull) \u2013 saxophone (2 and 7), harp (7)Production\n\nSteve Perry \u2013 producer\nJonathan Cain \u2013 additional vocal co-production\nRandy Goodrum \u2013 additional vocal co-production\nJim Gaines \u2013 associate producer, engineer\nMark McKenna \u2013 engineer\nSteve Rinkoff \u2013 engineer\nRobert Missbach \u2013 assistant engineer\nBob Clearmountain \u2013 mixing at Bearsville Studios and The Power Station (New York, NY)\nBob Ludwig \u2013 mastering at Masterdisk (New York, NY), remastering\nBrian Lee \u2013 remastering\n\nCharts\nCertifications","label":"longbench","length":11163,"title":"Passage 1:"}
{"context":"Introduction\nRendering natural language descriptions from structured data is required in a wide variety of commercial applications such as generating descriptions of products, hotels, furniture, etc., from a corresponding table of facts about the entity. Such a table typically contains {field, value} pairs where the field is a property of the entity (e.g., color) and the value is a set of possible assignments to this property (e.g., color = red). Another example of this is the recently introduced task of generating one line biography descriptions from a given Wikipedia infobox BIBREF0 . The Wikipedia infobox serves as a table of facts about a person and the first sentence from the corresponding article serves as a one line description of the person. Figure FIGREF2 illustrates an example input infobox which contains fields such as Born, Residence, Nationality, Fields, Institutions and Alma Mater. Each field further contains some words (e.g., particle physics, many-body theory, etc.). The corresponding description is coherent with the information contained in the infobox.\nNote that the number of fields in the infobox and the ordering of the fields within the infobox varies from person to person. Given the large size (700K examples) and heterogeneous nature of the dataset which contains biographies of people from different backgrounds (sports, politics, arts, etc.), it is hard to come up with simple rule-based templates for generating natural language descriptions from infoboxes, thereby making a case for data-driven models. Based on the recent success of data-driven neural models for various other NLG tasks BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , one simple choice is to treat the infobox as a sequence of {field, value} pairs and use a standard seq2seq model for this task. However, such a model is too generic and does not exploit the specific characteristics of this task as explained below. First, note that while generating such descriptions from structured data, a human keeps track of information at two levels. Specifically, at a macro level, she would first decide which field to mention next and then at a micro level decide which of the values in the field needs to be mentioned next. For example, she first decides that at the current step, the field occupation needs attention and then decides which is the next appropriate occupation to attend to from the set of occupations (actor, director, producer, etc.). To enable this, we use a bifocal attention mechanism which computes an attention over fields at a macro level and over values at a micro level. We then fuse these attention weights such that the attention weight for a field also influences the attention over the values within it. Finally, we feed a fused context vector to the decoder which contains both field level and word level information. Note that such two-level attention mechanisms BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 have been used in the context of unstructured data (as opposed to structured data in our case), where at a macro level one needs to pay attention to sentences and at a micro level to words in the sentences.\nNext, we observe that while rendering the output, once the model pays attention to a field (say, occupation) it needs to stay on this field for a few timesteps (till all the occupations are produced in the output). We refer to this as the stay on behavior. Further, we note that once the tokens of a field are referred to, they are usually not referred to later. For example, once all the occupations have been listed in the output we will never visit the occupation field again because there is nothing left to say about it. We refer to this as the never look back behavior. To model the stay on behaviour, we introduce a forget (or remember) gate which acts as a signal to decide when to forget the current field (or equivalently to decide till when to remember the current field). To model the never look back behaviour we introduce a gated orthogonalization mechanism which ensures that once a field is forgotten, subsequent field context vectors fed to the decoder are orthogonal to (or different from) the previous field context vectors.\nWe experiment with the WikiBio dataset BIBREF0 which contains around 700K {infobox, description} pairs and has a vocabulary of around 400K words. We show that the proposed model gives a relative improvement of 21% and 20% as compared to current state of the art models BIBREF0 , BIBREF9 on this dataset. The proposed model also gives a relative improvement of 10% as compared to the basic seq2seq model. Further, we introduce new datasets for French and German on the same lines as the English WikiBio dataset. Even on these two datasets, our model outperforms the state of the art methods mentioned above.\nRelated work\nNatural Language Generation has always been of interest to the research community and has received a lot of attention in the past. The approaches for NLG range from (i) rule based approaches (e.g., BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 ) (ii) modular statistical approaches which divide the process into three phases (planning, selection and surface realization) and use data driven approaches for one or more of these phases BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 (iii) hybrid approaches which rely on a combination of handcrafted rules and corpus statistics BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 and (iv) the more recent neural network based models BIBREF1 .\nNeural models for NLG have been proposed in the context of various tasks such as machine translation BIBREF1 , document summarization BIBREF2 , BIBREF4 , paraphrase generation BIBREF23 , image captioning BIBREF24 , video summarization BIBREF25 , query based document summarization BIBREF5 and so on. Most of these models are data hungry and are trained on large amounts of data. On the other hand, NLG from structured data has largely been studied in the context of small datasets such as WeatherGov BIBREF26 , RoboCup BIBREF27 , NFL Recaps BIBREF15 , Prodigy-Meteo BIBREF28 and TUNA Challenge BIBREF29 . Recently weather16 proposed RNN\/LSTM based neural encoder-decoder models with attention for WeatherGov and RoboCup datasets.\nUnlike the datasets mentioned above, the biography dataset introduced by lebret2016neural is larger (700K {table, descriptions} pairs) and has a much larger vocabulary (400K words as opposed to around 350 or fewer words in the above datasets). Further, unlike the feed-forward neural network based model proposed by BIBREF0 we use a sequence to sequence model and introduce components to address the peculiar characteristics of the task. Specifically, we introduce neural components to address the need for attention at two levels and to address the stay on and never look back behaviour required by the decoder. KiddonZC16 have explored the use of checklists to track previously visited ingredients while generating recipes from ingredients. Note that two-level attention mechanisms have also been used in the context of summarization BIBREF6 , document classification BIBREF7 , dialog systems BIBREF8 , etc. However, these works deal with unstructured data (sentences at the higher level and words at a lower level) as opposed to structured data in our case.\nProposed model\nAs input we are given an infobox INLINEFORM0 , which is a set of pairs INLINEFORM1 where INLINEFORM2 corresponds to field names and INLINEFORM3 is the sequence of corresponding values and INLINEFORM4 is the total number of fields in INLINEFORM5 . For example, INLINEFORM6 could be one such pair in this set. Given such an input, the task is to generate a description INLINEFORM7 containing INLINEFORM8 words. A simple solution is to treat the infobox as a sequence of fields followed by the values corresponding to the field in the order of their appearance in the infobox. For example, the infobox could be flattened to produce the following input sequence (the words in bold are field names which act as delimiters)\n[Name] John Doe [Birth_Date] 19 March 1981 [Nationality] Indian .....\nThe problem can then be cast as a seq2seq generation problem and can be modeled using a standard neural architecture comprising of three components (i) an input encoder (using GRU\/LSTM cells), (ii) an attention mechanism to attend to important values in the input sequence at each time step and (iii) a decoder to decode the output one word at a time (again, using GRU\/LSTM cells). However, this standard model is too generic and does not exploit the specific characteristics of this task. We propose additional components, viz., (i) a fused bifocal attention mechanism which operates on fields (macro) and values (micro) and (ii) a gated orthogonalization mechanism to model stay on and never look back behavior.\nFused Bifocal Attention Mechanism\nIntuitively, when a human writes a description from a table she keeps track of information at two levels. At the macro level, it is important to decide which is the appropriate field to attend to next and at a micro level (i.e., within a field) it is important to know which values to attend to next. To capture this behavior, we use a bifocal attention mechanism as described below.\nMacro Attention: Consider the INLINEFORM0 -th field INLINEFORM1 which has values INLINEFORM2 . Let INLINEFORM3 be the representation of this field in the infobox. This representation can either be (i) the word embedding of the field name or (ii) some function INLINEFORM4 of the values in the field or (iii) a concatenation of (i) and (ii). The function INLINEFORM5 could simply be the sum or average of the embeddings of the values in the field. Alternately, this function could be a GRU (or LSTM) which treats these values within a field as a sequence and computes the field representation as the final representation of this sequence (i.e., the representation of the last time-step). We found that bidirectional GRU is a better choice for INLINEFORM6 and concatenating the embedding of the field name with this GRU representation works best. Further, using a bidirectional GRU cell to take contextual information from neighboring fields also helps (these are the orange colored cells in the top-left block in Figure FIGREF3 with macro attention). Given these representations INLINEFORM7 for all the INLINEFORM8 fields we compute an attention over the fields (macro level). DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the state of the decoder at time step INLINEFORM1 . INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 are parameters, INLINEFORM4 is the total number of fields in the input, INLINEFORM5 is the macro (field level) context vector at the INLINEFORM6 -th time step of the decoder.\nMicro Attention: Let INLINEFORM0 be the representation of the INLINEFORM1 -th value in a given field. This representation could again either be (i) simply the embedding of this value (ii) or a contextual representation computed using a function INLINEFORM2 which also considers the other values in the field. For example, if INLINEFORM3 are the values in a field then these values can be treated as a sequence and the representation of the INLINEFORM4 -th value can be computed using a bidirectional GRU over this sequence. Once again, we found that using a bi-GRU works better then simply using the embedding of the value. Once we have such a representation computed for all values across all the fields, we compute the attention over these values (micro level) as shown below : DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the state of the decoder at time step INLINEFORM1 . INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 are parameters, INLINEFORM4 is the total number of values across all the fields.\nFused Attention: Intuitively, the attention weights assigned to a field should have an influence on all the values belonging to the particular field. To ensure this, we reweigh the micro level attention weights based on the corresponding macro level attention weights. In other words, we fuse the attention weights at the two levels as: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the field corresponding to the INLINEFORM1 -th value, INLINEFORM2 is the macro level context vector.\nGated Orthogonalization for Modeling Stay-On and Never Look Back behaviour\nWe now describe a series of choices made to model stay-on and never look back behavior. We first begin with the stay-on property which essentially implies that if we have paid attention to the field INLINEFORM0 at timestep INLINEFORM1 then we are likely to pay attention to the same field for a few more time steps. For example, if we are focusing on the occupation field at this timestep then we are likely to focus on it for the next few timesteps till all relevant values in this field have been included in the generated description. In other words, we want to remember the field context vector INLINEFORM2 for a few timesteps. One way of ensuring this is to use a remember (or forget) gate as given below which remembers the previous context vector when required and forgets it when it is time to move on from that field. DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 are parameters to be learned. The job of the forget gate is to ensure that INLINEFORM1 is similar to INLINEFORM2 when required (i.e., by learning INLINEFORM3 when we want to continue focusing on the same field) and different when it is time to move on (by learning that INLINEFORM4 ).\nNext, the never look back property implies that once we have moved away from a field we are unlikely to pay attention to it again. For example, once we have rendered all the occupations in the generated description there is no need to return back to the occupation field. In other words, once we have moved on ( INLINEFORM0 ), we want the successive field context vectors INLINEFORM1 to be very different from the previous field vectors INLINEFORM2 . One way of ensuring this is to orthogonalize successive field vectors using DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the dot product between vectors INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 . The above equation essentially subtracts the component of INLINEFORM3 along INLINEFORM4 . INLINEFORM5 is a learned parameter which controls the degree of orthogonalization thereby allowing a soft orthogonalization (i.e., the entire component along INLINEFORM6 is not subtracted but only a fraction of it). The above equation only ensures that INLINEFORM7 is soft-orthogonal to INLINEFORM8 . Alternately, we could pass the sequence of context vectors, INLINEFORM9 generated so far through a GRU cell. The state of this GRU cell at each time step would thus be aware of the history of the field vectors till that timestep. Now instead of orthogonalizing INLINEFORM10 to INLINEFORM11 we could orthogonalize INLINEFORM12 to the hidden state of this GRU at time-step INLINEFORM13 . In practice, we found this to work better as it accounts for all the field vectors in the history instead of only the previous field vector.\nIn summary, Equation provides a mechanism for remembering the current field vector when appropriate (thus capturing stay-on behavior) using a remember gate. On the other hand, Equation EQREF10 explicitly ensures that the field vector is very different (soft-orthogonal) from the previous field vectors once it is time to move on (thus capturing never look back behavior). The value of INLINEFORM0 computed in Equation EQREF10 is then used in Equation . The INLINEFORM1 (macro) thus obtained is then concatenated with INLINEFORM2 (micro) and fed to the decoder (see Fig. FIGREF3 )\nExperimental setup\nWe now describe our experimental setup:\nDatasets\nWe use the WikiBio dataset introduced by lebret2016neural. It consists of INLINEFORM0 biography articles from English Wikipedia. A biography article corresponds to a person (sportsman, politician, historical figure, actor, etc.). Each Wikipedia article has an accompanying infobox which serves as the structured input and the task is to generate the first sentence of the article (which typically is a one-line description of the person). We used the same train, valid and test sets which were made publicly available by lebret2016neural.\nWe also introduce two new biography datasets, one in French and one in German. These datasets were created and pre-processed using the same procedure as outlined in lebret2016neural. Specifically, we extracted the infoboxes and the first sentence from the corresponding Wikipedia article. As with the English dataset, we split the French and German datasets randomly into train (80%), test (10%) and valid (10%). The French and German datasets extracted by us has been made publicly available. The number of examples was 170K and 50K and the vocabulary size was 297K and 143K for French and German respectively. Although in this work we focus only on generating descriptions in one language, we hope that this dataset will also be useful for developing models which jointly learn to generate descriptions from structured data in multiple languages.\nModels compared\nWe compare with the following models:\n1. BIBREF0 : This is a conditional language model which uses a feed-forward neural network to predict the next word in the description conditioned on local characteristics (i.e., words within a field) and global characteristics (i.e., overall structure of the infobox).\n2. BIBREF9 : This model was proposed in the context of the WeatherGov and RoboCup datasets which have a much smaller vocabulary. They use an improved attention model with additional regularizer terms which influence the weights assigned to the fields.\n3. Basic Seq2Seq: This is the vanilla encode-attend-decode model BIBREF1 . Further, to deal with the large vocabulary ( INLINEFORM0 400K words) we use a copying mechanism as a post-processing step. Specifically, we identify the time steps at which the decoder produces unknown words (denoted by the special symbol UNK). For each such time step, we look at the attention weights on the input words and replace the UNK word by that input word which has received maximum attention at this timestep. This process is similar to the one described in BIBREF30 . Even lebret2016neural have a copying mechanism tightly integrated with their model.\nHyperparameter tuning\nWe tuned the hyperparameters of all the models using a validation set. As mentioned earlier, we used a bidirectional GRU cell as the function INLINEFORM0 for computing the representation of the fields and the values (see Section SECREF4 ). For all the models, we experimented with GRU state sizes of 128, 256 and 512. The total number of unique words in the corpus is around 400K (this includes the words in the infobox and the descriptions). Of these, we retained only the top 20K words in our vocabulary (same as BIBREF0 ). We initialized the embeddings of these words with 300 dimensional Glove embeddings BIBREF31 . We used Adam BIBREF32 with a learning rate of INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 . We trained the model for a maximum of 20 epochs and used early stopping with the patience set to 5 epochs.\nResults and Discussions\nWe now discuss the results of our experiments.\nComparison of different models\nFollowing lebret2016neural, we used BLEU-4, NIST-4 and ROUGE-4 as the evaluation metrics. We first make a few observations based on the results on the English dataset (Table TABREF15 ). The basic seq2seq model, as well as the model proposed by weather16, perform better than the model proposed by lebret2016neural. Our final model with bifocal attention and gated orthogonalization gives the best performance and does 10% (relative) better than the closest baseline (basic seq2seq) and 21% (relative) better than the current state of the art method BIBREF0 . In Table TABREF16 , we show some qualitative examples of the output generated by different models.\nHuman Evaluations\nTo make a qualitative assessment of the generated sentences, we conducted a human study on a sample of 500 Infoboxes which were sampled from English dataset. The annotators for this task were undergraduate and graduate students. For each of these infoboxes, we generated summaries using the basic seq2seq model and our final model with bifocal attention and gated orthogonalization. For each description and for each model, we asked three annotators to rank the output of the systems based on i) adequacy (i.e. does it capture relevant information from the infobox), (ii) fluency (i.e. grammar) and (iii) relative preference (i.e., which of the two outputs would be preferred). Overall the average fluency\/adequacy (on a scale of 5) for basic seq2seq model was INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 for our model respectively.\nThe results from Table TABREF17 suggest that in general gated orthogonalization model performs better than the basic seq2seq model. Additionally, annotators were asked to verify if the generated summaries look natural (i.e, as if they were generated by humans). In 423 out of 500 cases, the annotators said \u201cYes\u201d suggesting that gated orthogonalization model indeed produces good descriptions.\nPerformance on different languages\nThe results on the French and German datasets are summarized in Tables TABREF20 and TABREF20 respectively. Note that the code of BIBREF0 is not publicly available, hence we could not report numbers for French and German using their model. We observe that our final model gives the best performance - though the bifocal attention model performs poorly as compared to the basic seq2seq model on French. However, the overall performance for French and German are much smaller than those for English. There could be multiple reasons for this. First, the amount of training data in these two languages is smaller than that in English. Specifically, the amount of training data available in French (German) is only INLINEFORM0 ( INLINEFORM1 )% of that available for English. Second, on average the descriptions in French and German are longer than that in English (EN: INLINEFORM2 words, FR: INLINEFORM3 words and DE: INLINEFORM4 words). Finally, a manual inspection across the three languages suggests that the English descriptions have a more consistent structure than the French descriptions. For example, most English descriptions start with name followed by date of birth but this is not the case in French. However, this is only a qualitative observation and it is hard to quantify this characteristic of the French and German datasets.\nVisualizing Attention Weights\nIf the proposed model indeed works well then we should see attention weights that are consistent with the stay on and never look back behavior. To verify this, we plotted the attention weights in cases where the model with gated orthogonalization does better than the model with only bifocal attention. Figure FIGREF21 shows the attention weights corresponding to infobox in Figure FIGREF25 . Notice that the model without gated orthogonalization has attention on both name field and article title while rendering the name. The model with gated orthogonalization, on the other hand, stays on the name field for as long as it is required but then moves and never returns to it (as expected).\nDue to lack of space, we do not show similar plots for French and German but we would like to mention that, in general, the differences between the attention weights learned by the model with and without gated orthogonalization were more pronounced for the French\/German dataset than the English dataset. This is in agreement with the results reported in Table TABREF20 and TABREF20 where the improvements given by gated orthogonalization are more for French\/German than for English.\nOut of domain results\nWhat if the model sees a different INLINEFORM0 of person at test time? For example, what if the training data does not contain any sportspersons but at test time we encounter the infobox of a sportsperson. This is the same as seeing out-of-domain data at test time. Such a situation is quite expected in the products domain where new products with new features (fields) get frequently added to the catalog. We were interested in three questions here. First, we wanted to see if testing the model on out-of-domain data indeed leads to a drop in the performance. For this, we compared the performance of our best model in two scenarios (i) trained on data from all domains (including the target domain) and tested on the target domain (sports, arts) and (ii) trained on data from all domains except the target domain and tested on the target domain. Comparing rows 1 and 2 of Table TABREF32 we observed a significant drop in the performance. Note that the numbers for sports domain in row 1 are much better than the Arts domain because roughly 40% of the WikiBio training data contains sportspersons.\nNext, we wanted to see if we can use a small amount of data from the target domain to fine tune a model trained on the out of domain data. We observe that even with very small amounts of target domain data the performance starts improving significantly (see rows 3 and 4 of Table TABREF32 ). Note that if we train a model from scratch with only limited data from the target domain instead of fine-tuning a model trained on a different source domain then the performance is very poor. In particular, training a model from scratch with 10K training instances we get a BLEU score of INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 for arts and sports respectively. Finally, even though the actual words used for describing a sportsperson (footballer, cricketer, etc.) would be very different from the words used to describe an artist (actor, musician, etc.) they might share many fields (for example, date of birth, occupation, etc.). As seen in Figure FIGREF28 (attention weights corresponding to the infobox in Figure FIGREF27 ), the model predicts the attention weights correctly for common fields (such as occupation) but it is unable to use the right vocabulary to describe the occupation (since it has not seen such words frequently in the training data). However, once we fine tune the model with limited data from the target domain we see that it picks up the new vocabulary and produces a correct description of the occupation.\nConclusion\nWe present a model for generating natural language descriptions from structured data. To address specific characteristics of the problem we propose neural components for fused bifocal attention and gated orthogonalization to address stay on and never look back behavior while decoding. Our final model outperforms an existing state of the art model on a large scale WikiBio dataset by 21%. We also introduce datasets for French and German and demonstrate that our model gives state of the art results on these datasets. Finally, we perform experiments with an out-of-domain model and show that if such a model is fine-tuned with small amounts of in domain data then it can give an improved performance on the target domain.\nGiven the multilingual nature of the new datasets, as future work, we would like to build models which can jointly learn to generate natural language descriptions from structured data in multiple languages. One idea is to replace the concepts in the input infobox by Wikidata concept ids which are language agnostic. A large amount of input vocabulary could thus be shared across languages thereby facilitating joint learning.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Google for supporting Preksha Nema through their Google India Ph.D. Fellowship program.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nGroup Portrait with a Lady\nGroup Portrait with a Lady (German: Gruppenbild mit Dame) is a 1977 German-French drama film directed by Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107. It was entered into the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. It is based on the novel of the same name  by German Nobel-Prize winning novelist Heinrich B\u00f6ll.\n\nCast\nPassage 2:\nList of territorial entities where German is an official language\nThe following is a list of the countries and territories where German is an official language (also known as the Germanosphere). It includes countries that have German as (one of) their nationwide official language(s), as well as dependent territories with German as a co-official language.\n\nGerman as an official language\nGerman is the official language of six countries, all of which lie in central and western Europe. These countries (with the addition of South Tyrol of Italy) also form the Council for German Orthography and are referred to as the German Sprachraum (German language area). Since 2004, Meetings of German-speaking countries have been held annually with six participants: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Switzerland:\n\nSubdivisions of countries\nWhile not official at the national level, German is a co-official language in subdivisions of the countries listed below. In each of these regions, German is an official language on the administrative level.\n\nOther legal statuses\nThere are other political entities (countries as well as dependent entities) which acknowledge other legal statuses for the German language or one of its dialects. While these may cover minority rights, support of certain language facilities (schools, media, etc.), and the promotion of cultural protection\/heritage, they do not encompass the establishment of German as an \"official\" language, i.e., being required in public offices or administrative texts.\nThese countries include:\n\nBrazil (German is a statewide cultural language in Esp\u00edrito Santo and Rio Grande do Sul; Standard German official in 2 municipalities and non-standard German dialects official in 16 others)\nCzech Republic (national minority language)\nDenmark (minority language in Syddanmark, established with the Bonn-Copenhagen declarations, 1955)\nHungary (national minority language)\nNamibia (national language; co-official language 1884\u20131990)\nPoland (national minority language; also auxiliary language in 31 communes)\nRomania (national minority language)\nRussia (minority language in the Azovo German National District)\nSlovakia (regional minority language)Although in France, the High German varieties of Alsatian and Moselle Franconian are identified as \"regional languages\" according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 1998, the French government has not yet ratified the treaty, and therefore those varieties have no official legal status.Due to the German diaspora, other countries with sizable populations of (mostly bilingual) German L1 speakers include Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, Paraguay, as well as the United States. However, in none of these countries does German or a German variety have any legal status.\n\nInternational institutions\nGerman is an official language of the following international institutions:\n\nInternational sports associations:\nEuropean Handball Federation (EHF)\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT)\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Luge de Course (FIL)\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Ski (FIS)\nInternational Biathlon Union (IBU)\nUnion of European Football Associations (UEFA)\n\nNotes\nSee also\nGerman language in the Basic Law\nPassage 3:\nAleksandar Petrovi\u0107 (film director)\nAleksandar \"Sa\u0161a\" Petrovi\u0107 (14 January 1929 \u2013 20 August 1994) was a Serbian film director. He was one of the major figures of the Yugoslav Black Wave. Two of his films were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film: Three in 1966 and I Even Met Happy Gypsies (Feather Gatherers) in 1967. The latter (original title \"Skupljaci perja\") was the first movie that presented the existence of Gypsies in society and everyday life; it was also the first full-feature film where Gypsies spoke their own language, Roma. Most roles were interpreted by real Gypsies; this was their movie. \"As a child, I observed them and saw in these people faith and irrationality,\" said Petrovi\u0107 I Even Met Happy Gypsies won the FIPRESCI Prize and the Grand Prize of the Jury at the Cannes Film Festival; it also received a nomination for a Golden Globe. In 1967 Petrovi\u0107 was a member of the jury at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival.One of his most famous films is It Rains in My Village. Petrovi\u0107 found inspiration for this film in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel The Possessed. The film was nominated for a Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) at the 1969 Cannes Film FestivalIn 1973, Petrovi\u0107 was forced to leave his post at the Belgrade Film Academy after being accused of holding anti-communist views by the communist government of Yugoslavia. In late December 1989, he joined the founding committee of the Democratic Party in Serbia, the first opposition anti-communist party in Serbia. He died at age 65 in Paris, France.\nPetrovi\u0107 published several hundreds of articles and several books, including Novi film I: 1960-1965 and Novi film II: Crni film (1965-1970).\n\nFilmography\nPassage 4:\nYugoslavia at the Olympics\nTeams from Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920. Previously, several athletes from Croatia, Slovenia and northern Serbian province Vojvodina had competed for Austria or Hungary when those countries were part of the Empire of Austria-Hungary. A small team of two athletes had competed distinctly for Serbia at the 1912 Summer Olympics.\nYugoslavia has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:\n\nKingdom of Yugoslavia (officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929) from 1920 to 1936\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1948 to the 1992 Winter Olympics\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, formed as a joint state by only Montenegro and Serbia after the breakup of Yugoslavia, from 1992 to 2002 (due to UN ban allowed to compete as Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics and was not allowed to compete at 1994 Winter Olympics)Two of the successor nations (Croatia and Slovenia) began to compete as independent teams at the Olympics starting at the 1992 Winter Games and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 1992 Summer Games and as of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six successor nations, former socialist republics, have participated independently. Kosovo, a former autonomous province, made its Olympic debut as an independent national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nTimeline of participation\nThe Yugoslav Olympic Committee was established in Zagreb in 1919 (recognized by the IOC in 1920), before moving to Belgrade in 1927, and it took the place of the Serbian Olympic Committee in the Association of National Olympic Committees. During the dissolution of Yugoslavia, several new committees were formed in the break-away countries. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games since 1996. At the 1996 and 2000 Games, the nation was designated with the same code, Yugoslavia (YUG), as the defunct SFRY. It was rechartered as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 with there being no territorial changes. The Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) designation and code were used at the 2004 Games.\n\nHosted Games\nYugoslavia has hosted the Games on one occasion.\n\nMedal tables\n*Red border colour indicates the games were held on home soil.\n*Yugoslavia hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, now part of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nList of medalists\nSummer Olympics\nAs Federal Republic of YugoslaviaAs Independent Olympic Participants\n\nWinter Olympics\nSee also\nList of flag bearers for Yugoslavia at the Olympics\nCategory:Olympic competitors for Yugoslavia\nYugoslavia at the Paralympics\nList of Yugoslav Olympic medalists\nPassage 5:\nCatalan language\nCatalan (; autonym: catal\u00e0, Eastern Catalan: [k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8la]), known in the Valencian Community and Carche as Valencian (autonym: valenci\u00e0), is a Western Romance language. It is the official language of Andorra, and an official language of two autonomous communities in eastern Spain: Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. It is also an official language in Valencia, where it is called Valencian. It has semi-official status in the Italian comune of Alghero, and it is spoken in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales department of France and in two further areas in eastern Spain: the eastern strip of Aragon and the Carche area in the Region of Murcia. The Catalan-speaking territories are often called the Pa\u00efsos Catalans or \"Catalan Countries\".\nThe language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees. Nineteenth-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, culminating in the early 1900s.\n\nEtymology and pronunciation\nThe word Catalan is derived from the territorial name of Catalonia, itself of disputed etymology. The main theory suggests that Catalunya (Latin Gathia Launia) derives from the name Gothia or Gauthia (\"Land of the Goths\"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania > Catalonia theoretically derived.In English, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as Catelaner, followed in the 15th century as Catellain (from French). It is attested a language name since at least 1652. The word Catalan can be pronounced in English as ,  or .The endonym is pronounced [k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8la] in the Eastern Catalan dialects, and [kata\u02c8la] in the Western dialects. In the Valencian Community and Carche, the term valenci\u00e0 [valensi\u02c8a, ba-] is frequently used instead. Thus, the name \"Valencian\", although often employed for referring to the varieties specific to the Valencian Community and Carche, is also used by Valencians as a name for the language as a whole, synonymous with \"Catalan\". Both uses of the term have their respective entries in the dictionaries by the Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans. See also status of Valencian below.\n\nHistory\nMiddle Ages\nBy the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees, as well as the territories of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis to the south. From the 8th century onwards the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards at the expense of the Muslims, bringing their language with them. This process was given definitive impetus with the separation of the County of Barcelona from the Carolingian Empire in 988.In the 11th century, documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show Catalan elements, with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080. Old Catalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance, diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries.During the 11th and 12th centuries the Catalan rulers expanded southward to the Ebro river, and in the 13th century they conquered the Land of Valencia and the Balearic Islands. The city of Alghero in Sardinia was repopulated with Catalan speakers in the 14th century. The language also reached Murcia, which became Spanish-speaking in the 15th century.In the Low Middle Ages, Catalan went through a golden age, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness. Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232\u20131315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th\u201314th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausi\u00e0s March (1397\u20131459). By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon, and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world. During this period, the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language. Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th. During this period, the language was what Costa Carreras terms \"one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe\".Martorell's outstanding novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490) shows a transition from Medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in Metge's work. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.\n\nStart of the modern era\nSpain\nWith the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon in 1479, the Spanish kings ruled over different kingdoms, each with its own cultural, linguistic and political particularities, and they had to swear by the Laws of each territory before the respective Parliaments. But after the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain became an Absolute monarchy under Philip V, which led to the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Crown of Castile through the Nueva Planta decrees, as a first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state; as in other contemporary European states, this meant the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant groups. Since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards national minorities have been a constant.\n\nThe process of assimilation began with secret instructions to the corregidores of the Catalan territory: they \"will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed.\" From there, actions in the service of assimilation, discreet or aggressive, were continued, and reached to the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal Certificate forbidding anyone to \"represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish.\" Anyway, the use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the decline of Catalan. Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the nobles, part of the urban and literary classes became bilingual.\n\nFrance\nWith the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Spain ceded the northern part of Catalonia to France, and soon thereafter the local Catalan varieties came under the influence of French, which in 1700 became the sole official language of the region.Shortly after the French Revolution (1789), the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the regional languages of France, such as Catalan, Alsatian, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque.\n\nFrance: 19th to 20th century\nFollowing the French establishment of the colony of Algeria from 1830 onward, it received several waves of Catalan-speaking settlers. People from the Spanish Alicante province settled around Oran, whereas Algiers received immigration from Northern Catalonia and Menorca.\nTheir speech was known as patuet. By 1911, the number of Catalan speakers was around 100,000. After the declaration of independence of Algeria in 1962, almost all the Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia (as Pieds-Noirs) or Alacant.The government of France formally recognizes only French as an official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the General Council of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales officially recognized Catalan as one of the languages of the department and seeks to further promote it in public life and education.\n\nSpain: 18th to 20th century\nIn 1807, the Statistics Office of the French Ministry of the Interior asked the prefects for an official survey on the limits of the French language. The survey found that in Roussillon, almost only Catalan was spoken, and since Napoleon wanted to incorporate Catalonia into France, as happened in 1812, the consul in Barcelona was also asked. He declared that Catalan \"is taught in schools, it is printed and spoken, not only among the lower class, but also among people of first quality, also in social gatherings, as in visits and congresses\", indicating that it was spoken everywhere \"with the exception of the royal courts\". He also indicated that Catalan was spoken \"in the Kingdom of Valencia, in the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Sardinia, Corsica and much of Sicily, in the Vall d \"Aran and Cerda\u00f1a\".The defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) initiated a series of laws which, among other centralizing measures, imposed the use of Spanish in legal documentation all over Spain. Because of this, use of the Catalan language declined into the 18th century.\nHowever, the 19th century saw a Catalan literary revival (Renaixen\u00e7a), which has continued up to the present day. This period starts with Aribau's Ode to the Homeland (1833); followed in the second half of the 19th century, and the early 20th by the work of Verdaguer (poetry), Oller (realist novel), and Guimer\u00e0 (drama). In the 19th century, the region of Carche, in the province of Murcia was repopulated with Valencian speakers. Catalan spelling was standardized in 1913 and the language became official during the Second Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939). The Second Spanish Republic saw a brief period of tolerance, with most restrictions against Catalan lifted.The Catalan language and culture were frowned upon during the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939) and the subsequent decades in Francoist Catalonia. The Francoist dictatorship (1939\u20131975) imposed the use of Spanish in schools and in public administration in all of Spain. However, in 1944, it became mandatory by law for universities with Romance Philology to include the subject of Catalan Philology. Numerous and prestigious cultural contests were created to reward works produced in Catalan. In January 1944, the \"Eugenio Nadal\" award was created. In 1945, with the sponsorship and subsidy of the Government, the centenary of Moss\u00e8n Cinto Verdaguer was celebrated. In 1947 the Joan Martorell prize for novels in Catalan was awarded. In 1949, the V\u00edctor Catal\u00e0 award for short novels in Catalan and the Aedos awards for biographies, the Josep Ysart award for essays, and the Ossa Menor award, later renamed Carles Riba, were created. In 1951, a national prize was awarded to poetry in Catalan with the same financial amount as Spanish poetry. That same year, Selecta Editions was founded for works written in Catalan. And the Joanot Martorell is awarded to Josep Pla for his work El carrer estret. In subsequent years (50s, 60s and 70s) countless awards were born, such as the Lletra d'Or, Amadeu Oller for poetry, the Sant Jordi for novels (endowed with 150,000 pesetas), the Honor Award of Catalan Letters, the Verdaguer, the Josep Pla Prize, the Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda Prize for short stories and narratives. The first Catalan-language TV show was broadcast during the Franco period, in 1964. The Francoist dictatorship (1939\u20131975) banned the use of Catalan in schools and in public administration. At the same time, oppression of the Catalan language and identity was carried out in schools, through governmental bodies, and in religious centers. Franco's desire for a homogenous Spanish population resonated with some Catalans in favor of his regime, primarily members of the upper class, who began to reject the use of Catalan. Despite all of these hardships, Catalan continued to be used privately within households, and it was able to survive Francisco Franco's dictatorship. Several prominent Catalan authors resisted the suppression through literature.In addition to the loss of prestige for Catalan and its prohibition in schools, migration during the 1950s into Catalonia from other parts of Spain also contributed to the diminished use of the language. These migrants were often unaware of the existence of Catalan, and thus felt no need to learn or use it. Catalonia was the economic powerhouse of Spain, so these migrations continued to occur from all corners of the country. Employment opportunities were reduced for those who were not bilingual.\n\nPresent day\nSince the Spanish transition to democracy (1975\u20131982), Catalan has been institutionalized as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige. In Catalonia, there is an unparalleled large bilingual European non-state linguistic community. The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools, but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia in two situations \u2013 if the teacher assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish, or during the learning process of one or more recently arrived immigrant students. There is also some intergenerational shift towards Catalan.More recently, several Spanish political forces have tried to increase the use of Spanish in the Catalan educational system. As a result, in May 2022 the Spanish Supreme Court urged the Catalan regional government to enforce a measure by which 25% of all lessons must be taught in Spanish.According to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia, in 2013 the Catalan language is the second most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language: 7% of the population self-identifies with both Catalan and Spanish equally, 36.4% with Catalan and 47.5% only Spanish. In 2003 the same studies concluded no language preference for self-identification within the population above 15 years old: 5% self-identified with both languages, 44.3% with Catalan and 47.5% with Spanish. To promote use of Catalan, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia's official Autonomous government) spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories, with entities such as Consorci per a la Normalitzaci\u00f3 Ling\u00fc\u00edstica (Consortium for Linguistic Normalization)In Andorra, Catalan has always been the sole official language. Since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several policies favoring Catalan have been enforced, like Catalan medium education.On the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In the Northern Catalonia area of France, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004). Catalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary. The cultural association La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in Catalan language immersion programs.\nIn Alicante province, Catalan is being replaced by Spanish and in Alghero by Italian. There is also well ingrained diglossia in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.During the 20th century many Catalans emigrated or went into exile to Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina and other South American countries. They formed a large number of Catalan colonies that today continue to maintain the Catalan language. They also founded many Catalan casals (associations).\n\nClassification and relationship with other Romance languages\nOne classification of Catalan is given by P\u00e8ire B\u00e8c:\n\nRomance languages\nItalo-Western languages\nWestern Romance languages\nGallo-Iberian languages\nGallo-Romance languages\nOccitano-Romance languages\nCatalan languageHowever, the ascription of Catalan to the Occitano-Romance branch of Gallo-Romance languages is not shared by all linguists and philologists, particularly among Spanish ones, such as Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal.\nCatalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.\n\nRelationship with other Romance languages\nSome include Catalan in Occitan, as the linguistic distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon language) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century and still today remains its closest relative.Catalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, French, Italian, Sardinian as well as Spanish and Portuguese among others). However, despite being spoken mostly on the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan has marked differences with the Iberian Romance group (Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and especially vocabulary; it shows instead its closest affinity with languages native to France and northern Italy, particularly Occitan and to a lesser extent Gallo-Romance (Franco-Proven\u00e7al, French, Gallo-Italian).According to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between Catalan and other Romance languages is: 87% with Italian; 85% with Portuguese and Spanish; 76% with Ladin and Romansh; 75% with Sardinian; and 73% with Romanian.\nDuring much of its history, and especially during the Francoist dictatorship (1939\u20131975), the Catalan language was ridiculed as a mere dialect of Spanish. This view, based on political and ideological considerations, has no linguistic validity. Spanish and Catalan have important differences in their sound systems, lexicon, and grammatical features, placing the language in features closer to Occitan (and French).There is evidence that, at least from the 2nd century a.d., the vocabulary and phonology of Roman Tarraconensis was different from the rest of Roman Hispania. Differentiation arose generally because Spanish, Asturian, and Galician-Portuguese share certain peripheral archaisms (Spanish hervir, Asturian and Portuguese ferver vs. Catalan bullir, Occitan bolir \"to boil\") and innovatory regionalisms (Sp novillo, Ast nuviellu vs. Cat torell, Oc taur\u00e8l \"bullock\"), while Catalan has a shared history with the Western Romance innovative core, especially Occitan.Like all Romance languages, Catalan has a handful of native words which are unique to it, or rare elsewhere. These include:\n\nverbs: c\u014dnf\u012bgere 'to fasten; transfix' > confegir 'to compose, write up', congemin\u0101re > conjuminar 'to combine, conjugate', de-ex-somnitare > deixondar\/-ir 'to wake; awaken', d\u0113ns\u0101re 'to thicken; crowd together' > desar 'to save, keep', \u012bgn\u014dr\u0101re > enyorar 'to miss, yearn, pine for', ind\u0101g\u0101re 'to investigate, track' > Old Catalan enagar 'to incite, induce', odi\u0101re > OCat ujar 'to exhaust, fatigue', p\u0101cific\u0101re > apaivagar 'to appease, mollify', repudi\u0101re > rebutjar 'to reject, refuse';\nnouns: br\u012bsa > brisa 'pomace', buda > boga 'reedmace', catarrhu > cadarn 'catarrh', congesta > congesta 'snowdrift', d\u0113l\u012brium > deler 'ardor, passion', fretu > freu 'brake', l\u0101bem > (a)llau 'avalanche', \u014dra > vora 'edge, border', pistr\u012bce 'sawfish' > pestriu > pestiu 'thresher shark, smooth hound; ray', pr\u016bna 'live coal' > espurna 'spark', tard\u0101ti\u014dnem > tarda\u00f3 > tardor 'autumn'.The Gothic superstrate produced different outcomes in Spanish and Catalan. For example, Catalan fang \"mud\" and rostir \"to roast\", of Germanic origin, contrast with Spanish lodo and asar, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan filosa \"spinning wheel\" and templa \"temple\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish rueca and sien, of Germanic origin.The same happens with Arabic loanwords. Thus, Catalan alf\u00e0bia \"large earthenware jar\" and rajola \"tile\", of Arabic origin, contrast with Spanish tinaja and teja, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan oli \"oil\" and oliva \"olive\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish aceite and aceituna. However, the Arabic element in Spanish is generally much more prevalent.Situated between two large linguistic blocks (Iberian Romance and Gallo-Romance), Catalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar \"to miss somebody\", apaivagar \"to calm somebody down\", and rebutjar \"reject\".\n\nGeographic distribution\nCatalan-speaking territories\nTraditionally Catalan-speaking territories are sometimes called the Pa\u00efsos Catalans (Catalan Countries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status. Various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions.\n\nNumber of speakers\nThe number of people known to be fluent in Catalan varies depending on the sources used. A 2004 study did not count the total number of speakers, but estimated a total of 9\u20139.5 million by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where Catalan is spoken. The web site of the Generalitat de Catalunya estimated that as of 2004 there were 9,118,882 speakers of Catalan. These figures only reflect potential speakers; today it is the native language of only 35.6% of the Catalan population. According to Ethnologue, Catalan had 4.1 million native speakers and 5.1 million second-language speakers in 2021.\n\nAccording to a 2011 study the total number of Catalan speakers is over 9.8 million, with 5.9 million residing in Catalonia. More than half of them speak Catalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in Catalonia). Very few Catalan monoglots exist; basically, virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with a sizable population of Spanish-only speakers of immigrant origin (typically born outside Catalonia or whose parents were both born outside Catalonia) existing in the major Catalan urban areas as well.\nIn Roussillon, only a minority of French Catalans speak Catalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of language shift. According to a 2019 survey by the Catalan government, 31.5% of the inhabitants of Catalonia have Catalan as first language at home whereas 52.7% have Spanish, 2.8% both Catalan and Spanish and 10.8% other languages.Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. According to this census of 2013 Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city of 1,501,262: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% over the age of 2 can speak it (1,137,816), 79% can read it (1,246.555), and 53% can write it (835,080). The proportion in Barcelona who can speak it, 72.3%, is lower than that of the overall Catalan population, of whom 81.2% over the age of 15 speak the language. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. An important social characteristic of the Catalan language is that all the areas where it is spoken are bilingual in practice: together with the French language in Roussillon, with Italian in Alghero, with Spanish and French in Andorra and with Spanish in the rest of the territories.\n\n1.^  The number of people who understand Catalan includes those who can speak it.\n2.^  Figures relate to all self-declared capable speakers, not just native speakers.\n\nLevel of knowledge\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n\nSocial use\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n\nNative language\nPhonology\nCatalan phonology varies by dialect. Notable features include:\nMarked contrast of the vowel pairs \/\u025b e\/ and \/\u0254 o\/, as in other Western Romance languages, other than Spanish.\nLack of diphthongization of Latin short \u0115, \u014f, as in Galician and Portuguese, but unlike French, Spanish, or Italian.\nAbundance of diphthongs containing \/w\/, as in Galician and Portuguese.In contrast to other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words, and these may end in a wide variety of consonants, including some consonant clusters. Additionally, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, which gives rise to an abundance of such couplets as amic (\"male friend\") vs. amiga (\"female friend\").Central Catalan pronunciation is considered to be standard for the language. The descriptions below are mostly representative of this variety. For the differences in pronunciation between the different dialects, see the section on pronunciation of dialects in this article.\n\nVowels\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: \/a \u025b e i \u0254 o u\/, a common feature in Western Romance, with the exception of Spanish. Balearic also has instances of stressed \/\u0259\/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair \/\u025b e\/.In Central Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to three: \/a e \u025b\/ > [\u0259]; \/o \u0254 u\/ > [u]; \/i\/ remains distinct. The other dialects have different vowel reduction processes (see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article).\n\nConsonants\nThe consonant system of Catalan is rather conservative.\n\n\/l\/ has a velarized allophone in syllable coda position in most dialects. However, \/l\/ is velarized irrespective of position in Eastern dialects like Majorcan and standard Eastern Catalan.\n\/v\/ occurs in Balearic, Algherese, standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia. It has merged with \/b\/ elsewhere.\nVoiced obstruents undergo final-obstruent devoicing: \/b\/ > [p], \/d\/ > [t], \/\u0261\/ > [k].\nVoiced stops become lenited to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: \/b\/ > [\u03b2], \/d\/ > [\u00f0], \/\u0261\/ > [\u0263]. Exceptions include \/d\/ after lateral consonants, and \/b\/ after \/f\/. In coda position, these sounds are realized as stops, except in some Valencian dialects where they are lenited.\nThere is some confusion in the literature about the precise phonetic characteristics of \/\u0283\/, \/\u0292\/, \/t\u0283\/, \/d\u0292\/. Some sources describe them as \"postalveolar\". Others as \"back alveolo-palatal\", implying that the characters \u27e8\u0255 \u0291 t\u0255 d\u0291\u27e9 would be more accurate. However, in all literature only the characters for palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives are used, even when the same sources use \u27e8\u0255 \u0291\u27e9 for other languages like Polish and Chinese.\nThe distribution of the two rhotics \/r\/ and \/\u027e\/ closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast, but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset of the first syllable in a word, [r] appears unless preceded by a consonant. Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring [\u027e] and Central Catalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled [r] unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case [\u027e] appears.\nIn careful speech, \/n\/, \/m\/, \/l\/ may be geminated. Geminated \/\u028e\/ may also occur. Some analyze intervocalic [r] as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme. This is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics.\n\nPhonological evolution\nSociolinguistics\nCatalan sociolinguistics studies the situation of Catalan in the world and the different varieties that this language presents. It is a subdiscipline of Catalan philology and other affine studies and has as an objective to analyze the relation between the Catalan language, the speakers and the close reality (including the one of other languages in contact).\n\nPreferential subjects of study\nDialects of Catalan\nVariations of Catalan by class, gender, profession, age and level of studies\nProcess of linguistic normalization\nRelations between Catalan and Spanish or French\nPerception on the language of Catalan speakers and non-speakers\nPresence of Catalan in several fields: tagging, public function, media, professional sectors\n\nDialects\nOverview\nThe dialects of the Catalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%. The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Algherese dialect.Catalan is split in two major dialectal blocks: Eastern and Western. The main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e; which have merged to \/\u0259\/ in Eastern dialects, but which remain distinct as \/a\/ and \/e\/ in Western dialects. There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.Western Catalan comprises the two dialects of Northwestern Catalan and Valencian; the Eastern block comprises four dialects: Central Catalan, Balearic, Rossellonese, and Algherese. Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects. The terms \"Catalan\" and \"Valencian\" (respectively used in Catalonia and the Valencian Community) refer to two varieties of the same language. There are two institutions regulating the two standard varieties, the Institute of Catalan Studies in Catalonia and the Valencian Academy of the Language in the Valencian Community.\nCentral Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the largest number of speakers. It is spoken in the densely populated regions of the Barcelona province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.Catalan has an inflectional grammar. Nouns have two genders (masculine, feminine), and two numbers (singular, plural). Pronouns additionally can have a neuter gender, and some are also inflected for case and politeness, and can be combined in very complex ways. Verbs are split in several paradigms and are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and gender. In terms of pronunciation, Catalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other Romance languages.\n\nPronunciation\nVowels\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: \/a \u025b e i \u0254 o u\/, a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish. Balearic has also instances of stressed \/\u0259\/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair \/\u025b e\/.In Eastern Catalan (except Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: \/a e \u025b\/ > [\u0259]; \/o \u0254 u\/ > [u]; \/i\/ remains distinct. There are a few instances of unreduced [e], [o] in some words. Algherese has lowered [\u0259] to [a].\nIn Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: \/a e \u025b\/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however \/o \u0254\/ reduce to [o], with \/u\/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan.In Western Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: \/e \u025b\/ > [e]; \/o \u0254\/ > [o]; \/a u i\/ remain distinct. This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese. Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.Central, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed \/e\/ and \/\u025b\/. Usually, words with \/\u025b\/ in Central Catalan correspond to \/\u0259\/ in Balearic and \/e\/ in Western Catalan. Words with \/e\/ in Balearic almost always have \/e\/ in Central and Western Catalan as well. As a result, Central Catalan has a much higher incidence of \/\u025b\/.\n\nConsonants\nMorphology\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -e in verbs of the 1st conjugation and -\u2205 in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations in most of the Valencian Community, or -o in all verb conjugations in the Northern Valencian Community and Western Catalonia.E.g. parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (Northwestern Catalan).\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -o, -i, or -\u2205 in all conjugations. E.g. parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), and parli (Northern), all meaning ('I speak').\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -isc\/-esc, -ix, -ixen, -isca\/-esca.\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.\nWestern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, maintenance of \/n\/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.E.g. h\u00f2mens 'men', j\u00f3vens 'youth'.\nEastern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, loss of \/n\/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.E.g. homes 'men', joves 'youth' (Ibicencan, however, follows the model of Western Catalan in this case).\n\nVocabulary\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nStandards\nStandard Catalan, virtually accepted by all speakers, is mostly based on Eastern Catalan, which is the most widely used dialect. Nevertheless, the standards of the Valencian Community and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern Catalonia.The most notable difference between both standards is some tonic \u27e8e\u27e9 accentuation, for instance: franc\u00e8s, angl\u00e8s (IEC) \u2013 franc\u00e9s, angl\u00e9s (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, while pronouncing it as \/e\/ rather than \/\u025b\/, in some words like: qu\u00e8 ('what'), or Val\u00e8ncia. Other divergences include the use of \u27e8tl\u27e9 (AVL) in some words instead of \u27e8tll\u27e9 like in ametla\/ametlla ('almond'), espatla\/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, like subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('I buy').\nIn the Balearic Islands, IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the University of the Balearic Islands's philological section. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing'), but the university says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be cantam in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep').\nIn Alghero, the IEC has adapted its standard to the Algherese dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article lo instead of el, special possessive pronouns and determinants la mia ('mine'), lo sou\/la sua ('his\/her'), lo tou\/la tua ('yours'), and so on, the use of -v- \/v\/ in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: cantava, creixiva, llegiva; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Algherese: manco instead of menys ('less'), calqui u instead of alg\u00fa ('someone'), qual\/quala instead of quin\/quina ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of weak pronouns.\nIn 2011, the Aragonese government passed a decree approving the statutes of a new language regulator of Catalan in La Franja (the so-called Catalan-speaking areas of Aragon) as originally provided for by Law 10\/2009. The new entity, designated as Acad\u00e8mia Aragonesa del Catal\u00e0, shall allow a facultative education in Catalan and a standardization of the Catalan language in La Franja.\n\nStatus of Valencian\nValencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the northwestern varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (provinces of Lleida and the western half of Tarragona). Central Catalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian.Linguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian Community, the Valencian Academy of Language (Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) declares the linguistic unity between Valencian and Catalan varieties.\n\nThe AVL, created by the Valencian parliament, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian, and its standard is based on the Norms of Castell\u00f3 (Normes de Castell\u00f3). Currently, everyone who writes in Valencian uses this standard, except the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Acad\u00e8mia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses for Valencian an independent standard.\nDespite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004 showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan. This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Acad\u00e8mia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses for Valencian a standard independent from Catalan.This clash of opinions has sparked much controversy. For example, during the drafting of the European Constitution in 2004, the Spanish government supplied the EU with translations of the text into Basque, Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the latter two were identical.\n\nVocabulary\nWord choices\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.Literary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there has been a tendency towards favoring words of Northern dialects to the detriment of others, even though nowadays there is a greater freedom of choice.\n\nLatin and Greek loanwords\nLike other languages, Catalan has a large list of loanwords from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in Ramon Llull's work. In the 14th and 15th centuries Catalan had a far greater number of Greco-Latin loanwords than other Romance languages, as is attested for example in Ro\u00eds de Corella's writings. The incorporation of learned, or \"bookish\" words from its own ancestor language, Latin, into Catalan is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Catalan speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing\u2014and eventually speech\u2014in Catalan.\n\nWord formation\nThe process of morphological derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages, where agglutination is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example el\u00e8ctric [\u0259\u02c8l\u025bktrik] (\"electrical\") vs. electricitat [\u0259l\u0259ktrisi\u02c8tat]. Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, as in preveure (\"foresee\").There is greater regularity in the process of word-compounding, where one can find compounded words formed much like those in English.\n\nWriting system\nCatalan uses the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs. The Catalan orthography is systematic and largely phonologically based. Standardization of Catalan was among the topics discussed during the First International Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC, founded in 1911) published the Normes ortogr\u00e0fiques in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castell\u00f3 de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called Normes de Castell\u00f3, a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra's Catalan language norms.\n\nGrammar\nThe grammar of Catalan is similar to other Romance languages. Features include:\nUse of definite and indefinite articles.\nNouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine), and number (singular and plural). There is no case inflexion, except in pronouns.\nVerbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).\nThere are no modal auxiliaries.\nWord order is freer than in English.\n\nGender and number inflection\nIn gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian), the loss of the typical masculine suffix -o. Thus, the alternance of -o\/-a, has been replaced by \u00f8\/-a. There are only a few exceptions, like minso\/minsa (\"scarce\"). Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, such as:\nAffrication: boig\/boja (\"insane\") vs. lleig\/lletja (\"ugly\")\nLoss of n: pla\/plana (\"flat\") vs. segon\/segona (\"second\")\nFinal obstruent devoicing: sentit\/sentida (\"felt\") vs. dit\/dita (\"said\")Catalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has noi\/noia (\"boy\"\/\"girl\") and gall\/gallina (\"cock\"\/\"hen\"), whereas French has gar\u00e7on\/fille and coq\/poule.There is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favor of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent\/bullenta (\"boiling\") in contrast with traditional bullent\/bullent.As in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely. The most important one is the addition of -o- before certain consonant groups, a phonetic phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: el pols\/els polsos (\"the pulse\"\/\"the pulses\") vs. la pols\/les pols (\"the dust\"\/\"the dusts\").\n\nDeterminers\nThe inflection of determinatives is complex, specially because of the high number of elisions, but is similar to the neighboring languages. Catalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, like dels (\"of + the [plural]\"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).Central Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favor of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian.\n\nPersonal pronouns\nThe morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, especially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian). Features include the gender-neutral ho and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).Catalan pronouns exhibit T\u2013V distinction, like all other Romance languages (and most European languages, but not Modern English). This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.\nThis flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a \u00e9l. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).\n\nVerbs\nLike all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.The Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the synthetic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of anar (\"to go\") + infinitive.Catalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.\n\nSyntax\nThe grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is subject\u2013verb\u2013object. However, word order is very flexible. Commonly, verb-subject constructions are used to achieve a semantic effect. The sentence \"The train has arrived\" could be translated as Ha arribat el tren or El tren ha arribat. Both sentences mean \"the train has arrived\", but the former puts a focus on the train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival. This subtle distinction is described as \"what you might say while waiting in the station\" versus \"what you might say on the train.\"\n\nCatalan names\nIn Spain, every person officially has two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname. The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the Catalan conjunction i (\"and\").\n\nSample text\nSelected text from Manuel de Pedrolo's 1970 novel Un amor fora ciutat (\"A love affair outside the city\").\n\nSee also\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nSerbian language\nSerbian (\u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \/ srpski, pronounced [sr\u0329\u0302pski\u02d0]) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian language mainly used by Serbs. It is the official and national language of Serbia, one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and co-official in Montenegro and Kosovo. It is a recognized minority language in Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.\nStandard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian (more specifically on the dialects of \u0160umadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovina), which is also the basis of standard Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin varieties and therefore the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Montenegrins was issued in 2017. The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia, which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian.\nSerbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107, who created it based on phonemic principles. The Latin alphabet used for Serbian (latinica) was designed by the Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in the 1830s based on the Czech system with a one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correlation between the Cyrillic and Latin orthographies, resulting in a parallel system.\n\nClassification\nSerbian is a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian, a Slavic language (Indo-European), of the South Slavic subgroup. Other standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian are Bosnian, Croatian, and Montenegrin. \"An examination of all the major 'levels' of language shows that BCS is clearly a single language with a single grammatical system.\" It has lower intelligibility with the Eastern South Slavic languages Bulgarian and Macedonian, than with Slovene (Slovene is part of the Western South Slavic subgroup, but there are still significant differences in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation to the standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian, although it is closer to the Kajkavian and Chakavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian).\n\nGeographic distribution\nFigures of speakers according to countries:\n\nSerbia: 6,540,699 (official language)\nBosnia and Herzegovina: 1,086,027 (co-official language)\nGermany: 568,240\nAustria: 350,000\nMontenegro: 265,890 (language in official use)\nSwitzerland: 186,000\nUnited States: 172,874\nSweden: 120,000\nItaly: 106,498\nKosovo: est. 70.000\u2013100.000 (co-official language)\nCanada: 72,690\nAustralia: 55,114\nCroatia: 52,879 (recognized minority language)\nSlovenia: 38,964\nNorth Macedonia: 24,773 (recognized minority language)\nRomania: 22,518 (recognized minority language)\n\nStatus in Montenegro\nSerbian was the official language of Montenegro until October 2007 when the new Constitution of Montenegro replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties, Montenegrin was made the sole official language of the country, and Serbian was given the status of a language in official use along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian.In the 2011 Montenegrin census, 42.88% declared Serbian to be their native language, while Montenegrin was declared by 36.97% of the population.\n\nDifferences between standard Serbian and standard Croatian and Bosnian\nWriting system\nStandard Serbian language uses both Cyrillic (\u045b\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430, \u0107irilica) and Latin script (latinica, \u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430). Serbian is a rare example of synchronic digraphia, a situation where all literate members of a society have two interchangeable writing systems available to them. Media and publishers typically select one alphabet or the other. In general, the alphabets are used interchangeably; except in the legal sphere, where Cyrillic is required, there is no context where one alphabet or another predominates.\nAlthough Serbian language authorities have recognized the official status of both scripts in contemporary Standard Serbian for more than half of a century now, due to historical reasons, the Cyrillic script was made the official script of Serbia's administration by the 2006 Constitution.The Latin script continues to be used in official contexts, although the government has indicated its desire to phase out this practice due to national sentiment. The Ministry of Culture believes that Cyrillic is the \"identity script\" of the Serbian nation.However, the law does not regulate scripts in standard language, or standard language itself by any means, leaving the choice of script as a matter of personal preference and to the free will in all aspects of life (publishing, media, trade and commerce, etc.), except in government paperwork production and in official written communication with state officials, which have to be in Cyrillic.\n\nUsage\nTo most Serbians, the Latin script tends to imply a cosmopolitan or neutral attitude, while Cyrillic appeals to a more traditional or vintage sensibility.In media, the public broadcaster, Radio Television of Serbia, predominantly uses the Cyrillic script whereas the privately run broadcasters, like RTV Pink, predominantly use the Latin script. Newspapers can be found in both scripts.\nIn the public sphere, with logos, outdoor signage and retail packaging, the Latin script predominates, although both scripts are commonly seen. The Serbian government has encouraged increasing the use of Cyrillic in these contexts. Larger signs, especially those put up by the government, will often feature both alphabets; if the sign has English on it, then usually only Cyrillic is used for the Serbian text.\nA survey from 2014 showed that 47% of the Serbian population favors the Latin alphabet whereas 36% favors the Cyrillic one.Latin script has become more and more popular in Serbia, as it is easier to input on phones and computers.\n\nAlphabetic order\nThe sort order of the \u0107irilica (\u045b\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430) alphabet:\n\nCyrillic order called Azbuka (\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430): \u0410 \u0411 \u0412 \u0413 \u0414 \u0402 \u0415 \u0416 \u0417 \u0418 \u0408 \u041a \u041b \u0409 \u041c \u041d \u040a \u041e \u041f \u0420 \u0421 \u0422 \u040b \u0423 \u0424 \u0425 \u0426 \u0427 \u040f \u0428The sort order of the latinica (\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430) alphabet:\n\nLatin order called Abeceda (\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0430): A B C \u010c \u0106 D D\u017e \u0110 E F G H I J K L Lj M N Nj O P R S \u0160 T U V Z \u017d\n\nGrammar\nSerbian is a highly inflected language, with grammatical morphology for nouns, pronouns and adjectives as well as verbs.\n\nNouns\nSerbian nouns are classified into three declensional types, denoted largely by their nominative case endings as \"-a\" type, \"-i\" and \"-e\" type. Into each of these declensional types may fall nouns of any of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Each noun may be inflected to represent the noun's grammatical case, of which Serbian has seven:\n\nNominative\nGenitive\nDative\nAccusative\nVocative\nInstrumental\nLocativeNouns are further inflected to represent the noun's number, singular or plural.\n\nPronouns\nPronouns, when used, are inflected along the same case and number morphology as nouns. Serbian is a pro-drop language, meaning that pronouns may be omitted from a sentence when their meaning is easily inferred from the text. In cases where pronouns may be dropped, they may also be used to add emphasis. For example:\n\nAdjectives\nAdjectives in Serbian may be placed before or after the noun they modify, but must agree in number, gender and case with the modified noun.\n\nVerbs\nSerbian verbs are conjugated in four past forms\u2014perfect, aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect\u2014of which the last two have a very limited use (imperfect is still used in some dialects, but the majority of native Serbian speakers consider it archaic), one future tense (also known as the first future tense, as opposed to the second future tense or the future exact, which is considered a tense of the conditional mood by some contemporary linguists), and one present tense. These are the tenses of the indicative mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the imperative mood. The conditional mood has two more tenses: the first conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses) and the second conditional (without use in the spoken language\u2014it should be used for impossible conditional clauses). Serbian has active and passive voice.\nAs for the non-finite verb forms, Serbian has one infinitive, two adjectival participles (the active and the passive), and two adverbial participles (the present and the past).\n\nVocabulary\nMost Serbian words are of native Slavic lexical stock, tracing back to the Proto-Slavic language. There are many loanwords from different languages, reflecting cultural interaction throughout history. Notable loanwords were borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, English, Russian, German, Czech and French.\n\nSerbian literature\nSerbian literature emerged in the Middle Ages, and included such works as Miroslavljevo jevan\u0111elje (Miroslav's Gospel) in 1186 and Du\u0161anov zakonik (Du\u0161an's Code) in 1349. Little secular medieval literature has been preserved, but what there is shows that it was in accord with its time; for example, the Serbian Alexandride, a book about Alexander the Great, and a translation of Tristan and Iseult into Serbian. Although not belonging to the literature proper, the corpus of Serbian literacy in the 14th and 15th centuries contains numerous legal, commercial and administrative texts with marked presence of Serbian vernacular juxtaposed on the matrix of Serbian Church Slavonic.\nBy the beginning of the 14th century the Serbo-Croatian language, which was so rigorously proscribed by earlier local laws, becomes the dominant language of the Republic of Ragusa. However, despite her wealthy citizens speaking the Serbo-Croatian dialect of Dubrovnik in their family circles, they sent their children to Florentine schools to become perfectly fluent in Italian. Since the beginning of the 13th century, the entire official correspondence of Dubrovnik with states in the hinterland was conducted in Serbian.In the mid-15th century, Serbia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and for the next 400 years there was no opportunity for the creation of secular written literature. However, some of the greatest literary works in Serbian come from this time, in the form of oral literature, the most notable form being epic poetry. The epic poems were mainly written down in the 19th century, and preserved in oral tradition up to the 1950s, a few centuries or even a millennium longer than by most other \"epic folks\". Goethe and Jacob Grimm learned Serbian in order to read Serbian epic poetry in the original. By the end of the 18th century, the written literature had become estranged from the spoken language. In the second half of the 18th century, the new language appeared, called Slavonic-Serbian. This artificial idiom superseded the works of poets and historians like Gavrilo Stefanovi\u0107 Venclovi\u0107, who wrote in essentially modern Serbian in the 1720s. These vernacular compositions have remained cloistered from the general public and received due attention only with the advent of modern literary historians and writers like Milorad Pavi\u0107. In the early 19th century, Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 promoted the spoken language of the people as a literary norm.\n\nDialects\nThe dialects of Serbo-Croatian, regarded Serbian (traditionally spoken in Serbia), include:\n\n\u0160umadija\u2013Vojvodina (Ekavian, Neo-Shtokavian): central and northern Serbia\nEastern Herzegovinian (Ijekavian, Neo-Shtokavian): southwestern Serbia, western half of Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia\nKosovo\u2013Resava (Ekavian, Old-Shtokavian): eastern central Serbia, central Kosovo\nSmederevo\u2013Vr\u0161ac (Ekavian, Old-Shtokavian): east-central Serbia\nPrizren\u2013Timok (transitional Torlakian): southeastern Serbia, southern Kosovo\nZeta\u2013Ra\u0161ka (Ijekavian, Old-Shtokavian): eastern half of Montenegro, southwestern Serbia\n\nDictionaries\nVuk Karad\u017ei\u0107's Srpski rje\u010dnik, first published in 1818, is the earliest dictionary of modern literary Serbian. The Rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika (I\u2013XXIII), published by the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts from 1880 to 1976, is the only general historical dictionary of Serbo-Croatian. Its first editor was \u0110uro Dani\u010di\u0107, followed by Pero Budmani and the famous Vukovian Tomislav Mareti\u0107. The sources of this dictionary are, especially in the first volumes, mainly \u0160tokavian. There are older, pre-standard dictionaries, such as the 1791 German\u2013Serbian dictionary or 15th century Arabic-Persian-Greek-Serbian Conversation Textbook.\n\nStandard dictionaries\nDictionary of Serbo-Croatian Literary and Vernacular Language (Re\u010dnik srpskohrvatskog knji\u017eevnog i narodnog jezika) is the biggest dictionary of Serbian (and Serbo-Croatian as a whole) and still unfinished. Starting in 1959, 21 volumes were published as of 2020 and about 40 are expected by the time it is finished.\nDictionary of Serbo-Croatian Literary Language (Re\u010dnik srpskohrvatskoga knji\u017eevnog jezika) in six volumes in 1967\u20131976, started as a common project of Matica srpska (published in Cyrillic) and Matica hrvatska (published in Latin). Only the first three volumes were published by Matica hrvatska due to negative feedback from Croatian linguists.\nDictionary of the Serbian language (Re\u010dnik srpskoga jezika; ISBN 978-86-7946-004-2) in one volume, published in 2007 by Matica srpska, which on more than 1500 pages in A4 format explains more than 85,000 entries.\n\nEtymological dictionaries\nThe standard and the only completed etymological dictionary of Serbian is the \"Skok\", written by the Croatian linguist Petar Skok: Etimologijski rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika (\"Etymological Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian\"). I-IV. Zagreb 1971\u20131974.\nThere is also a new monumental Etimolo\u0161ki re\u010dnik srpskog jezika (Etymological Dictionary of Serbian). So far, two volumes have been published: I (with words on A-), and II (Ba-Bd).\nThere are specialized etymological dictionaries for German, Italian, Croatian, Turkish, Greek, Hungarian, Russian, English and other loanwords (cf. chapter word origin).\n\nDialectal dictionaries\nKosovsko-resavski dialect dictionaries:\nGli\u0161a Elezovi\u0107, Re\u010dnik kosovsko-metohiskog dijalekta I-II. 1932\/1935.\nPrizren-Timok (Torlakian) dialect dictionaries:\nBrana Mitrovi\u0107, Re\u010dnik leskova\u010dkog govora.

She has received various accolades, including a Young Artist Award, and nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards.\nBiel began her career as a vocalist appearing in musical productions until she was cast as Mary Camden in the family drama series 7th Heaven (1996\u20132006), in which she achieved recognition.In 1997, Biel won the Young Artist Award for her role in the drama film Ulee's Gold. She received further recognition for her lead role as Erin Hardesty in the horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003). Biel has since starred in such films as The Rules of Attraction (2002), Blade: Trinity (2004), Stealth (2005), The Illusionist (2006), I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry (2007), Valentine's Day (2010), The A-Team (2010), New Year's Eve (2011), Total Recall (2012), and Hitchcock (2012).\nIn 2017, Biel was the executive producer and star of the USA Network limited drama series The Sinner, for which she received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.\n\nEarly life\nJessica Claire Biel was born on March 3, 1982, in Ely, Minnesota, to Kimberly (n\u00e9e Conroe), a homemaker and spiritual healer, and Jonathan Biel, a business consultant and General Electric worker. Her paternal great-grandfather was the son of Hungarian-Jewish immigrants, which she discovered on the show Who Do You Think You Are?; she also has German, French, English, and Scandinavian ancestry. Her younger brother, Justin, launched and runs the eco-accessory line BARE. Biel's family moved frequently during her childhood, living in Texas, Connecticut, and Woodstock, Illinois, before finally settling in Boulder, Colorado. While growing up, Biel played soccer and trained as a level six gymnast. From 2000 to 2002, she attended Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\nCareer\nBeginnings (1991\u20132002)\nBiel initially trained to be a vocalist. At age nine, she appeared in several musical productions in her hometown, playing lead roles in productions such as The Sound of Music and Beauty and the Beast. At 11 she participated in a competition sponsored by the International Modeling and Talent Association in Los Angeles where she acquired an agent and professional talent manager. She began modeling for print advertisements and appeared in commercials for products such as Dulux Paint and Pringles. In her film debut, Biel played the character Regrettal, a lead role in the ambitious musical film It's a Digital World, produced and directed by Paul Greenberg. At age 14, after auditioning for several television pilots, Biel was cast as Mary Camden, the oldest daughter and second-oldest child in the family drama 7th Heaven.Biel landed her first feature film role as Peter Fonda's granddaughter in the critically acclaimed drama Ulee's Gold, released in 1997. Her performance earned her a Young Artist Award. In spring 1998, during a break from filming 7th Heaven, she co-starred in I'll Be Home for Christmas with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as his character's love interest. When she was 17, she posed for a risque photo shoot that appeared in the March 2000 issue of Gear. Producers of 7th Heaven were outraged and brought legal action against Gear.  She later expressed regret for doing it, claiming she had been used and that she had been shown different pictures from those published. In 2001, Biel played the love interest of Freddie Prinze, Jr. in the baseball-themed film Summer Catch. In 2002, she starred as promiscuous college student Lara in the ensemble film The Rules of Attraction, an adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel. The movie received mixed reviews, became a box-office hit, and has since gained a cult following.\n\nRise to prominence (2003\u20132012)\nBiel was cast in her first top-billing role in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Although the film met with negative reviews, it was a commercial success, scoring the number-one spot in its opening week and going on to earn more than $80 million in the U.S. In 2003, Biel began work on the third installment of the Blade film series, Blade: Trinity. Despite negative reviews, Trinity was a box office hit, grossing $150 million worldwide. After finishing it in 2004, she headed to Australia to shoot the action-thriller Stealth. Biel also appeared in the 2004 film Cellular; played a supporting role, Ellen, in the romantic comedy Elizabethtown (2005); and starred in the indie film London. In 2005, Esquire named her the \"Sexiest Woman Alive\" in a six-part series with each month revealing a different body part and clue to the woman's identity.In 2006, Biel played a turn-of-the-century duchess in the period piece The Illusionist, co-starring Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti. While her casting was met with a mixed response, her performance was ultimately praised. James Berardinelli of Reelviews called her the \"film's real acting revelation\", while Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, \"Handily employing a refined English accent where the others lay on a light Austrian veneer, Biel is entirely stunning enough to fight to the death over.\" Biel played an Iraq War veteran in the 2006 film Home of the Brave, a drama about soldiers struggling to readjust to society after facing the hardships of war. In Next Biel starred alongside Nicolas Cage and Julianne Moore. She appeared in the summer comedy I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, co-starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. In late 2007, Biel signed on to play a stripper in Powder Blue, alongside Forest Whitaker (who also produced the film), Ray Liotta and Patrick Swayze. In 2007, Stuff magazine's named her No. 1 on their \"100 Sexiest Women\".At the start of 2008, Biel shot Easy Virtue, an adaptation of the play by No\u00ebl Coward. Like the play, the film is set in the 1920s and Biel plays young widow Larita, who impulsively marries John Whittaker in France and must face her disapproving in-laws on returning to England. The film premiered in September 2008 at the Toronto International Film Festival. Critics praised Biel for her performance, with Todd McCarthy of Variety saying Biel \"more than kept up\" with veterans Kristin Scott Thomas and Colin Firth and praising her \"sparkling\" performance. The Hollywood Reporter described her performance as \"an irresistible force of nature \u2014 a kind, witty, supremely intelligent and beautiful woman who ... is capable of rejoinders that thoroughly undercut her opponent's withering criticism.\" Biel also performed two songs on the film's soundtrack, \"Mad About the Boy\" and \"When the Going Gets Tough\".In 2009, Biel lent her voice to the animated science fiction film Planet 51. Biel performed the role of Sarah Brown with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a fully staged concert production of Guys and Dolls during the 2009 season at the Hollywood Bowl. On the last night, she received a rousing standing ovation from 17,000 people. She subsequently landed a part in Lincoln Center Theater's two-week-long workshop of the musical version of the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, along with Salma Hayek.In 2010, Biel starred in the large ensemble cast film Valentine's Day and in the A-Team, based on the television series as Capt. Charissa Sosa. In 2011, she appeared in New Year's Eve, directed by Valentine's Day's Garry Marshall. In 2012, Biel starred in the remake of the 1990 science fiction movie Total Recall alongside Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale. She portrayed actress Vera Miles in the biographical film Hitchcock, based on Stephen Rebello's book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho. She also appeared in Playing for Keeps with Gerard Butler.\n\nIndependent film route and move into producing (2013\u2013present)\nBiel starred in the thriller film Emanuel and the Truth About Fishes, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2013. In April 2008, Biel began working on the political satire Nailed, with Jake Gyllenhaal. The film centers around a woman who accidentally gets a nail lodged in her head and travels to Washington, D.C. to fight for better health care. In May 2009, Biel spoke about the film's production turmoil, saying: \"That was definitely an experience, something I could not say no to. I am a huge David O. Russell fan. It's just heartbreaking that so many people put so much work into this particular project only to have it sit there, unfinished.\" The film was released on video on demand on February 10, 2015, and received largely negative reviews from critics.In 2015, Biel starred in the independent drama Bleeding Heart, in which she plays a yoga instructor named May who meets her biological sister Shiva (Zosia Mamet), a sex worker, for the first time. The film premiered on April 17, 2015, at the Tribeca Film Festival, receiving mixed reviews, though Biel earned praise for her performance. Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair commented: \"Though she's not given too much to work with in terms of character, Biel plays May with appealing nuance, creating a low-key, bliss-based Angeleno, all light and airy and gentle and poised, who discovers within herself an untapped hardness and anger and strength... when Biel has to conjure up more profound emotions, she proves adept, and surprisingly subtle.\" Clayton Davis of AwardsCircuit.com also praised her performance, writing, \"With an internalized and very subtle performance, Biel excels in her ability to find the very motivation of May.\"In 2016, Biel co-starred with Patrick Wilson (with whom she had worked on The A-Team) in the thriller A Kind of Murder, based on the novel The Blunderer by Patricia Highsmith. She voiced the character Vix in the animated film Spark, with Susan Sarandon and Hilary Swank, which was released in 2016. Biel also appeared in the drama The Book of Love, based on the book The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, about an introverted architect (Jason Sudeikis) who loses his wife (Biel) and sets out to help a teenager named Millie (Maisie Williams). Biel also produced the project from its conception some years prior, and was directed by Bill Purple, who directed her in the short film Hole in the Paper Sky. The film was released in January 2017.On August 2, 2017, Biel's eight-episode limited series murder mystery, The Sinner, debuted on USA Network. Biel is both executive producer and played the series' lead character Cora Tannetti. She stated that she moved into production so that she could develop projects with challenging and interesting roles rather than waiting for them to happen.In October 2021, it was announced Biel would star and executive produce the true-crime drama miniseries Candy for Hulu.\n\nPersonal life\nIn January 2007, Biel began dating singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake. They became engaged in December 2011 and married on October 19, 2012, at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy. Biel and Timberlake have two sons together: one born in April 2015, and another born in July 2020.Alongside anti-vaccination conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Biel publicly lobbied in June 2019 against California's vaccination bill that would limit medical exemptions from vaccinations without approval from a state public health officer.\n\nCharitable causes\nOn July 18, 2006, Biel participated in a charity auction to raise medical funds for teen Molly Bloom, who was injured in a limousine accident. \"I promise I'm a cheap date\", Biel quipped in a pre-recorded video. John Schiffner of Fergus Falls, Minnesota, successfully bid $30,000 to have lunch with Biel. Biel and Schiffner lunched at The Palm restaurant in Denver, Colorado, on August 18, 2006. In early 2007, Biel co-founded the Make the Difference Network with her father and another business partner, Kent McBride. In 2010, Biel climbed to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro with members of the United Nations Foundation to raise awareness of the global water crisis. That same year Biel earned a nomination for a Do Something Award. Biel teamed with nonprofit health care organization WomanCare Global to develop content that will provide girls with sex education.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nMusic videos\nAwards and nominations\nPassage 3:\nCharisma (horse)\nCharisma (30 October 1972 \u2013 7 January 2003), nicknamed \"Podge\" and \"Stroppy\", was a horse ridden by New Zealander Mark Todd. Charisma won many competitions in the sport of eventing. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest event horses ever to have competed. He stood 15.3 hands (63 inches, 160 cm).\n\nBreeding and early life\nCharisma's dam, Planet, stood  15 hands (60 inches, 152 cm) and was sired by the Thoroughbred\/Percheron-cross Kiritea. Planet's dam was a Thoroughbred named Starbourne. Planet was a successful Grade A show jumper in New Zealand and under rider Sheryl Douglas, became the first mare in New Zealand to jump her own height. After an injury ended her career, she was bred to the Thoroughbred stallion Tira Mink,  and Charisma was foaled on 30 October 1972.\nCharisma's first home was on the Williams' 3,000-acre (12 km2) farm in Wairarapa, New Zealand. Even at a young age, Charisma was laid-back and easy to train. He was soon bought by David Murdoch, who placed the yearling in a small pasture with a four-foot fence, which Charisma jumped. The colt was gelded as a four-year-old, although he managed to cover four mares before that time.\n\nCompetitive career\nThe Beginning: 1977\u20131982\nThe young horse was slowly broken in, and later bought by Sharon Dearden in 1977. She competed him in Grade B show jumping competitions, and trained him up to intermediate level in eventing. Although the pair was long-listed for the Los Angeles Olympics, Dearden decided to sell the horse. Mrs. Fran Clark bought him and later lent him to Jennifer Stobart. Stobart brought him to Prix St Georges level in dressage \"just for fun\".\n\nUnder Mark Todd: 1983\u20131986\nMark Todd was offered Charisma to ride by Virginia Caro, as his experienced horse was sick. In May 1983, he tried the gelding out, and brought him back to his place to get the horse fit. Charisma was a bit fat at that time, and had to be bedded on newspaper strips, as he would try to eat other bedding. Keeping the weight off the horse was always quite a struggle.\nCharisma won his first two one-day events with Mark Todd, and then won the National One-Day Event Championship and National Three-day Event at Taupo (both of which he led after dressage and finished on his dressage score). The pair was then selected for the Los Angeles Olympics.Charisma was moved to England in February 1984. During the trip he became sick, and the illness never really left him for the rest of his career. The gelding was taken to the Badminton Horse Trials later that year, where he finished in 2nd place on his dressage score. Another satisfying finish came a few months later, at the Los Angeles Olympic Games. Mark and Charisma finished well after dressage, and then put in a clear cross-country and stadium round. A rail down by Karen Stives, who was leading by a few points, allowed the pair to cinch the individual gold.After the Olympics, Charisma's owner, Fran Clark, decided to sell her horse. However, for some reason she did not seem to want Mark Todd to continue with Charisma as a mount. In 1985, she offered Charisma to the British rider Lizzie Purbrick. Knowing that Todd wanted the horse badly, Purbrick managed a deal with him to buy Charisma behind Fran Clark's back. Mark Todd's sponsor, Woolrest, transferred 50,000 pounds to Lizzie's account, to which she paid Fran Clark, and Mark Todd now was the official rider of Charisma under Woolrest's sponsorship. Needless, to say, Fran Clark was not pleased.\nMark Todd continued to compete Charisma in England, where he placed second at the 1985 Badminton Horse Trials, and won every one-day event of the season in which they competed, except Dauntsey after a fall on cross-country. In 1986, the pair went to the World Championships in Australia. Unfortunately, they had a fall at the water, and two rails down in stadium, and they finished in 10th place. They redeemed themselves a few weeks later in Luhmuhlen, where they won both individually and as part of a composite team.\n\nThe end of his career: 1987\u20131988\nHowever, Charisma never got his chance to win Badminton, as it was cancelled in 1987. He won the three-star in Saumur, and the pair almost won Burghley that year, but two rails down in show jumping dropped them to second. They later won the British Open Championships before shipping to Seoul.At the 1988 Olympics, Charisma put in a stellar dressage test, and jumped clear rounds in both the cross-country and stadium. He won the individual gold yet again, and beat the second-place horse, Sir Wattie, by the incredible margin of 10.20 penalties. The New Zealand team also won the bronze that year. The back-to-back Olympic win in eventing had only been accomplished once before.\n\nRetirement\nCharisma was retired after his second Olympic victory and he went home to New Zealand. He then went on a six-month tour before taking a well-earned rest. He was later shipped to Britain in 1995 to continue retirement.\nOn 7 January 2003, Charisma was euthanized at Mark Todd's Rivermonte Farm in Cambridge, after breaking a shoulder in the field. He was 30 years old.\n\nAchievements\nSecond Place at the Badminton Horse Trials in 1984 and 1985\nIndividual Gold at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles\nWon the Luhmuhlen, Germany Three-Day Event in 1986\nSecond Place at the Burghley Horse Trials, England in 1987\nWon the British Open Championships in 1987\nIndividual Gold and Team Bronze at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul\nVoted best NZ Sport Horse in the world in 1983 and 1985\nSmallest Thoroughbred foal in Invercargill, NZ in 1972\nHorse with the most fan mail in New Zealand\nCarried Mark Todd into the stadium carrying the torch at the opening ceremony of the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand\nPassage 4:\nJohn Ranelagh\nJohn Ranelagh (John O'Beirne Ranelagh) is a television executive and producer, and an author of history and of current politics.

Discovery. It is a part of The Cartoon Network, Inc., a division that also has the broadcasting and production activities of Boomerang, Cartoonito, Adult Swim, and Toonami under its purview. The channel is headquartered at 1050 Techwood Drive NW in Atlanta, Georgia.\nFounded by Ted Turner (who appointed Betty Cohen as the first president of the network), the channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts animated television series, mostly children's programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It currently runs from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET\/PT on Mondays through Saturdays, and from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sundays (the sign-off time varies with holidays and special programming). Cartoon Network primarily targets children aged 6 to 12, while its early morning block Cartoonito is aimed at preschool-aged children, and nighttime block Adult Swim targets older teenagers and young adults aged 18 to 34.Cartoon Network offers an alternate Spanish-language audio feed, either via a separate channel with the English audio track removed as part of a package of Spanish-language television networks sold by subscription providers, or a separate audio track accessible through the SAP option, depending on the provider.\nAs of March 2021, Cartoon Network is available to approximately 94 million paid television households in the United States.\n\nHistory\nOn August 9, 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\/United Artists. On October 18, Turner forcibly sold back MGM. However, Turner kept much of the film and television library made before May 1986 (including some of the UA library) and formed Turner Entertainment Co. On October 8, 1988, its cable channel Turner Network Television was launched and gained an audience with its extensive film library. In 1991, Turner also purchased the library of animation studio Hanna-Barbera. Ted Turner selected Betty Cohen (then-Senior Vice President of TNT) to devise a network to house these programs. On February 18, 1992, Turner Broadcasting announced its plans to launch Cartoon Network as an outlet for an animation library. On October 1, 1992, the network officially launched as the first 24-hour single-genre cable channel with animation as its main theme.\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division Cartoon Network Studios was founded and started production on What a Cartoon!. This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts. In 1996, Cartoon Network aired two preschool programs: Big Bag, a live-action\/puppet television program with animated short series produced by Children's Television Workshop, and Small World, which featured animated series aimed at preschoolers imported from foreign countries. Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner, which consolidated\/reverted ownership of all the Warner Bros. cartoons. The network could then continue more original productions.\n\nProgramming\nCartoon Network's current original programming includes such shows as\nThe Amazing World of Gumball, Craig of the Creek, Teen Titans Go!, and We Baby Bears. The network's original programming is produced at Cartoon Network Studios, while other shows have either been co-produced with or acquired from other studios, including the affiliated Warner Bros. Animation. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced and aired live-action and animated hybrid programming.\nOver the years, Cartoon Network has aired various Looney Tunes, Merrie Melodies, Tom and Jerry and Droopy shorts in constant rotation, dating back to the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of Warner Bros. (Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (Tom and Jerry), Hanna-Barbera (The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, Snorks), and DC Comics (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Justice League and Teen Titans). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something its rivals didn't have. Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\nOriginal series\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, Cartoon Network Studios. Beginning as a division of Hanna-Barbera, this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including Dexter's Laboratory, Cow and Chicken, I Am Weasel, Johnny Bravo, and The Powerpuff Girls. Cartoon Cartoons was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original animated television series, but it was seldom used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008. Additionally several of the Cartoon Network's original series have been produced by studios other than the network's own in-house studio. Notable examples of this being Ed, Edd n Eddy, Courage the Cowardly Dog, and Codename: Kids Next Door. The name was resurrected by the network in 2021, for a new animated shorts program.\n\nProgramming blocks\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Cartoon Cartoon Fridays served as the channel's flagship block, featuring premieres of Cartoon Network original series that fell under the Cartoon Cartoons branding; from 2003 to 2007, the block was renamed to \"Fridays\" after Cartoon Network began to phase out the Cartoon Cartoons branding. The Toonami block, which originally ran from 1997 to 2008, primarily carried action-oriented series aimed towards an older youth and teen audience, including imported anime series; it was later re-launched under the auspices of Adult Swim in 2012. 2008 saw the introduction of CN Real, a block that featured live-action reality television series aimed towards a youth audience. In 2011, the channel introduced DC Nation, a block that would be focused on series adapted from DC Comics properties.In September 2021, Cartoon Network introduced two new blocks oriented towards preschool and family viewing respectively, including the preschool block Cartoonito, and the new Sunday-evening block ACME Night\u2013which primarily carries family films and library content, as well as other original series, specials, and television films from Warner Bros. Animation, as well as some programming from Adult Swim. They were introduced as part of an effort by new head Tom Ascheim to broaden Cartoon Network's demographic reach.\n\nEditing of theatrical cartoon shorts\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the Warner Bros. animated shorts originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while The Scarlet Pumpernickel (1950) and Feed the Kitty (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.There was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as June Bugs, promising to broadcast every Bugs Bunny animated short in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the Censored Eleven list of Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using ethnic and national stereotypes, albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that.\"\n\nRelated brands and units\nCartoonito\nCartoonito is a preschool programming brand owned by Warner Bros.; the brand was first launched in 2006 for use in international markets. In February 2021, it was announced that Cartoonito would make its U.S. debut as a block on Cartoon Network and as a content brand on HBO Max; the Cartoon Network block launched on September 13, 2021.\n\nAdult Swim\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is the adult-oriented programming brand of Cartoon Network. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the all-ages, preteen daytime programming of Cartoon Network. As a result, Adult Swim is treated by Nielsen as a separate channel in its ratings reports (similar to Nickelodeon's Nick at Nite block) and marketed as such because of its differing target demographics. The block broadcasts both animated and live-action shows (including original programming, reruns of animated sitcoms, and other action and anime series) generally with minimal or no editing for content.\nAs of May 2023, Adult Swim broadcasts from 7:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. ET\/PT on Monday through Saturdays, and from 9:00 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Sundays. Initially airing in the late-night hours, it has since expanded into prime time, moving its start time to 10 p.m. in 2009, and 8 p.m. in March 2014 (although the hour was given back to Cartoon Network for programming events and premieres, such as Steven Universe Future, in the fall-to-early-winter period).Due to increasing viewership of Cartoon Network in the evening hours by viewers over 18, Adult Swim's sign-on was moved to 7 p.m. ET\/PT on weekdays and Saturdays on May 1, 2023. It will expand further to 6 p.m. on  August 28; this hour will initially feature the sub-block \"Checkered Past\" on weekdays, airing reruns of classic Cartoon Network original series.\n\nToonami\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"tsunami\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand used for action-oriented programming blocks and television channels worldwide. The original program block launched on Cartoon Network in the United States on March 17, 1997, and primarily aired both American cartoons and Japanese anime. The block would end its original run on September 20, 2008, before it was later revived on May 26, 2012, as a relaunch of Adult Swim's Saturday night anime block. Toonami's current incarnation is similar to that of the \"Midnight Run\", a special version of the block that originally ran on Saturday nights and was the forerunner for Adult Swim. The block is best known for its branding and aesthetic, including its animated host, a robot named TOM, that was later voiced by Steven Blum.\nThe Toonami brand was also used internationally for dedicated networks in the United Kingdom (replacing CNX), Asia (in December 2012), India (in February 2015), and France (in February 2016).\n\nBoomerang\nBoomerang is a brand dedicated to classic and theatrical cartoons aimed towards children 7\u201313. It was originally a weekend programming block that aired on Cartoon Network from December 8, 1992, until October 3, 2004. On April 1, 2000, Boomerang received a new look and was spun off into its own cable channel. In 2017, an online Boomerang video-on-demand service was launched, which includes classic series along with new episodes of original series like Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?, New Looney Tunes, and The Tom and Jerry Show.\n\nOther services\nProduction studios\nCartoon Network Studios\nCartoon Network Studios is a production studio located in the network's West Coast headquarters of Burbank, California, which serves as the network's first animation studio division to provide original programs for the network, succeeding Hanna-Barbera. While the studio makes original programs for the network, original Cartoon Network and Cartoonito shows like Big Bag, Ed, Edd n Eddy, Mike, Lu & Og, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Sheep in the Big City, Codename: Kids Next Door, The Secret Saturdays, and Sunday Pants were all produced without Cartoon Network Studios\u2019 involvement. Starting from 2014, it starts producing shows for Adult Swim alongside its sister company Williams Street, following botched attempts to launch pilots on the block. It also produces live-action shows under the pseudonyms Alive and Kicking, Inc., Rent Now Productions and Factual Productions, formerly for Cartoon Network and currently for Adult Swim.\n\nWilliams Street\nWilliams Street Productions is the adult production studio division that provides original program to the network's late-night programming block Adult Swim that is located in Atlanta, Georgia, along with the main headquarters of the network.

Several video games based on the cartoon series Ben 10 were released by Cartoon Network as well. The Cartoon Network website also features various browser games incorporating characters from various Cartoon Network franchises. One such game was FusionFall, a massive multiplayer game released on January 14, 2009, and shut down on August 29, 2013.\n\nMovies\nCartoon Network has produced various films, most of them being television films; the only films from Cartoon Network that had a theatrical release are The Powerpuff Girls Movie, Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, Regular Show: The Movie and Teen Titans Go!

Sam Register served as the site's Senior Vice President and Creative Director from 1997 to 2001. In its early years, small studios partnered with the network to produce exclusive \"Web Premiere Toons\", short cartoons made specifically for CartoonNetwork.com. More about animation was included in the \"Department of Cartoons\", which featured storyboards, episode guides, backgrounds, sound and video files, model sheets, production notes, and other information about shows on the network. In January 1999, the Department of Cartoons showcased the \"MGM Golden Age Collection\", most of which had not been published or even seen in more than 50 years. Cartoon Network launched Cartoon Orbit, an online gaming network characterized by digital trading cards called \"cToons\", in October 2000. The game officially ended on October 16, 2006.\nIn October 2000, CartoonNetwork.com outdid its rival Nickelodeon's website in terms of unique users, scoring 2.12 million compared to Nick.com's 1.95 million. In July 2007, Nielsen ratings data showed visitors spent an average of 77 minutes on the site, surpassing the previous record of 71 minutes set in 2004, and the site ranked 26th in terms of time spent for all US domains.\n\nMarketing\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as Dexter's Laboratory, allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with Kraft Foods led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and Tower Records. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent Warner Bros. Discovery, allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.Time Warner Cable, the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was spun off from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. Turner Broadcasting System, the subsidiary overseeing various Warner Bros. Discovery-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at Kids' WB (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while Xiaolin Showdown and \u00a1Mucha Lucha!, two of Kids' WB's original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. Time Inc., the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as Time, Entertainment Weekly and Sports Illustrated Kids until Time Inc. was spun off from WarnerMedia on June 9, 2014. AOL, a now-former sibling company to WarnerMedia covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online sweepstakes and display advertising for CN.Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, the home video subsidiary, distributes VHS tapes, DVDs and Blu-ray discs featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select Warner Bros. Family Entertainment VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. Rhino Entertainment, the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was spun off from Warner Bros. Discovery in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the Warner Bros. Studio Store. DC Comics, the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. Warner Bros., the film studio subsidiary, released The Powerpuff Girls Movie in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to HBO or Cinemax, two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book tie-ins through Warner Books as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.Cartoon Network also licensed its original series out for food promotions. Nestl\u00e9 was granted a licensing agreement that resulted in a Wonder Ball chocolate candy tie-in with Cartoon Network characters and logos beginning in 2003. A new Wonder Ball promotion began in 2004 with characters from Ed, Edd n Eddy and exclusive Wonderball prizes and cToons on the Cartoon Orbit website.\n\nInternational channels\nSince its inception, Cartoon Network and its sister channels have set up various national and regional feeds. Since the early 1990s and 2000s, the network has expanded to countries including Canada, Mexico, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Africa, and several Asia-Pacific regions.\n\nSee also\nAdult Swim\nBoomerang\nCartoonito\nPassage 6:\nThe Greatest Event in Television History\nThe Greatest Event in Television History is a mockumentary TV special series created by Adam Scott and Naomi Scott. The series premiered on Cartoon Network's late night programming block Adult Swim on October 12, 2012 and ended on January 23, 2014 with a total of four episodes. Each episode originally aired independently as a \"special presentation\", several months apart.\n\nFormat\nThe format of each special is a brief mockumentary about the shot-for-shot remake of a 1980s TV series opening credits sequence, followed by the remake itself. Series co-creator Adam Scott says the specials are at least in part motivated by his own memories of watching 1980s TV as a kid. Each episode is hosted by Jeff Probst with actors portraying fictional versions of themselves or others. After each episode, the original opening credit scene is shown.\n\nProduction\nFour episodes were produced during the show's run; the series finale aired on January 23, 2014. In an interview with Splitsider, Scott explained the conclusion of the series: \"It's a lot of work for such a short, stupid thing... they're really fun and they're fun to make, but we're ready to move on.\"\n\nCast\nAmanda Anka as voiceover (voice)\nJeff Probst as himself\nJon Hamm as Rick Simon\nAdam Scott as A.J.

He was an early champion of the music of Olivier Messiaen, Peter Maxwell Davies and Kenneth Leighton. He also directed the specially-commissioned music for the 1951 revival of the York Mystery Plays, regarded as the greatest event in the Festival of Britain celebrations.\n\nCareer\nThe son of a parson, Wicks began his musical studies as a pianist at an early age, but did not think that he would be good enough to become professional. He was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead and at the age of 14 he was advised to convert to the organ. He took his degree at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was also organ scholar at the cathedral, assistant to Thomas Armstrong. Completing his studies after serving in the 14th Punjab Regiment, gaining an MA and an FRCO, he then took up post at York Minster in 1947, as sub-organist to Francis Jackson. He described his time at York as being much easier than modern cathedral organists: \"In those days it was easier to manage on one's own, because we never used to conduct, except a cappella pieces, we never conducted like cathedral organists now who hardly ever play the organ, they're down there wagging a finger, waving their arms about.\" Whilst based in York, he was on the music staff at St Peter's School and Chorus Master of Leeds Philharmonic Society. For the 1951 revival of the York Mystery Plays he was director of the music, composed by his friend James Brown. The plays captured the hearts of the British public, and have been performed regularly ever since.In 1954, Wicks left York to take the job of organist and choirmaster of Manchester Cathedral. There he inspired Maxwell Davies by his directing the choir in performances of John IV of Portugal and John Dunstaple. Wicks also championed Maxwell Davies's Fantasia on O Magnum Mysterium, as well as Malcolm Williamson's six-movement Symphony. He also organised a Cantata Choir and a small orchestra for Tuesday evening concerts of larger-scale works, including Igor Stravinsky's Canticum Sacrum and Messiaen's Messe de la Pentec\u00f4te.In 1961 he was appointed organist and master of the choristers of Canterbury Cathedral, where he served for 27 years, under three Archbishops, retiring after being appointed C.B.E. in 1988. Whilst at Canterbury, he also was honoured with the Lambeth MusDoc in 1974 and an honorary DMus from the University of Kent in 1985.\nWicks died in 2010, and was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and their two daughters.\n\nOrganist posts\n1941\u20131946: Organ Scholar, Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford (interrupted by wartime service in the 14th Punjab Regiment)\n1947\u20131954: Sub Organist, York Minster\n1954\u20131961: Organist at Manchester Cathedral.\n1961\u20131988: Organist at Canterbury Cathedral.\nPassage 8:\n2005 World Series of Poker\nThe 2005 World Series of Poker opened play on June 2, continuing through the Main Event No Limit World Championship starting on July 7.

It was produced by Constant C Productions and Amblin Television, in association with Warner Bros. Television. ER follows the inner life of the emergency room (ER) of Cook County General Hospital (a fictionalized version of the real Cook County Hospital) in Chicago, and various critical issues faced by the department's physicians and staff.\nThe show is the second longest-running primetime medical drama in American television history behind Grey's Anatomy, and the seventh longest medical drama across the globe (behind the United Kingdom's Casualty and Holby City, [United States\u2019s] Grey's Anatomy, Germany's In aller Freundschaft,  Poland's Na dobre i na z\u0142e, and New Zealand's Shortland Street). It won 23 Primetime Emmy Awards, including the 1996 Outstanding Drama Series award, and received 124 Emmy nominations. ER won 116 awards in total, including the Peabody Award, while the cast earned four Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Ensemble Performance in a Drama Series. As of 2014, ER has grossed over $3 billion in television revenue.\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn 1974, author Michael Crichton wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a medical student in a busy hospital emergency room. The screenplay went nowhere and Crichton turned to other topics. In 1990, he published the novel Jurassic Park, and in 1993 began a collaboration with director Steven Spielberg on the film adaptation of the book. Crichton and Spielberg then turned to ER, but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film. Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment provided John Wells as the show's executive producer.\nThe script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in 1974. The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 were that the Susan Lewis character became a woman and the Peter Benton character became African-American, and the running time was shortened by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. Because of a lack of time and money necessary to build a set, the pilot episode of ER was filmed in the former Linda Vista Hospital in Los Angeles, an old facility that had ceased operating in 1990. A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital's emergency room was built soon afterward at the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California, although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous \"L\" train platforms.Warren Littlefield, running NBC Entertainment at the time, was impressed by the series: \"We were intrigued, but we were admittedly a bit spooked in attempting to go back into that territory a few years after St. Elsewhere.\" With Spielberg attached behind the scenes, NBC ordered six episodes. \"ER premiered opposite a Monday Night Football game on ABC and did surprisingly well. Then we moved it to Thursday and it just took off\", commented Littlefield. ER's success surprised the networks and critics alike, as David E. Kelley's new medical drama Chicago Hope was expected to crush the new series.Crichton remained executive producer until his death in November 2008, although he was still credited as one throughout that entire final season. Wells, the series' other initial executive producer, served as showrunner for the first three seasons. He was one of the show's most prolific writers and became a regular director in later years. Lydia Woodward was a part of the first season production team and became an executive producer for the third season. She took over as showrunner for the fourth season while Wells focused on the development of other series, including Trinity, Third Watch, and The West Wing. She left her executive producer position at the end of the sixth season but continued to write episodes throughout the series' run.\nJoe Sachs, who was a writer and producer of the series, believed keeping a commitment to medical accuracy was extremely important: \"We'd bend the rules but never break them. A medication that would take 10 minutes to work might take 30 seconds instead. We compressed time. A 12- to 24-hour shift gets pushed into 48 minutes. But we learned that being accurate was important for more reasons than just making real and responsible drama.\"Woodward was replaced as showrunner by Jack Orman. Orman was recruited as a writer-producer for the series in its fourth season after a successful stint working on CBS's JAG. He was quickly promoted and became an executive producer and showrunner for the series' seventh season. He held these roles for three seasons before leaving the series at the end of the ninth season. Orman was also a frequent writer and directed three episodes of the show.\nDavid Zabel served as the series' head writer and executive producer in its later seasons. He initially joined the crew for the eighth season and became an executive producer and showrunner for the twelfth season onward. Zabel was the series' most frequent writer, contributing to 41 episodes. He also made his directing debut on the series. Christopher Chulack was the series' most frequent director and worked as a producer on all 15 seasons. He became an executive producer in the fourth season but occasionally scaled back his involvement in later years to focus on other projects.\nOther executive producers include writers Carol Flint, Neal Baer, R. Scott Gemmill, Dee Johnson, Joe Sachs, Lisa Zwerling, and Janine Sherman Barrois. Several of these writers and producers had background in healthcare: Joe Sachs was an emergency physician, while Lisa Zwerling and Neal Baer were both pediatricians. The series' crew was recognized with awards for writing, directing, producing, film editing, sound editing, casting, and music.\n\nBroadcasting\nFollowing the broadcast of its two-hour pilot movie on September 19, 1994, ER premiered Thursday, September 22 at 10pm. It remained in the same Thursday time slot for its entire run, capping the Must See TV primetime block. ER is NBC's third longest-running drama, after Law & Order and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and the second longest-running American primetime medical drama of all time, behind Grey's Anatomy. Starting with season seven, ER was broadcast in the 1080i HD format, appearing in letterbox format when presented in standard definition. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series would return for its fifteenth season. The fifteenth season was originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, but NBC announced in January 2009 that it would extend the show by an additional three episodes to a full 22-episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells titled Police, later retitled Southland. ER's final episode aired on April 2, 2009; the two-hour episode was preceded by a one-hour retrospective special. The series finale charged $425,000 per 30-second ad spot, more than three times the season's rate of $135,000. From season 4 to season 6 ER cost a record-breaking $13 million per episode. TNT also paid a record price of $1 million an episode for four years of repeats of the series during that time. The cost of the first three seasons was $2 million per episode and seasons 7 to 9 cost $8 million per episode.In September 1998, TNT aired syndicated reruns of the series.\n\nCast and characters\nThe original starring cast consisted of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Mark Greene, George Clooney as Dr. Doug Ross, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, Noah Wyle as medical student John Carter, and Eriq La Salle as Dr. Peter Benton. As the series continued, some key changes were made: Nurse Carol Hathaway, played by Julianna Margulies, who attempts suicide in the original pilot script, was made into a regular cast member. Ming-Na Wen debuted in the middle of the first season as medical student Jing-Mei \"Deb\" Chen, but did not return for the second season; she returns in season 6 episode 10. Gloria Reuben and Laura Innes would join the series as Physician Assistant Jeanie Boulet and Dr. Kerry Weaver, respectively, by the second season.In the third season, a series of cast additions and departures began that would see the entire original cast leave over time. Stringfield was the first to exit the series, reportedly upsetting producers who believed she wanted to negotiate for more money, but the actress did not particularly care for \"fame.\"\n She would return to the series from 2001 until 2005. Clooney departed the series in 1999 to pursue a film career, and Margulies exited the following year. Season eight saw the departure of La Salle and Edwards when Benton left County General and Greene died from a brain tumor. Wyle left the series after season 11 in order to spend more time with his family, but would return for two multiple-episode appearances in the show's final seasons. Goran Visnjic as Dr. Luka Kova\u010d, Maura Tierney as Dr. Abby Lockhart, Alex Kingston as Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Paul McCrane as Dr. Robert Romano, and Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Greg Pratt all joined the cast as the seasons went on. In the much later seasons, the show would see the additions of Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris, Parminder Nagra as Dr. Neela Rasgotra, Shane West as Dr. Ray Barnett, Linda Cardellini as nurse Samantha Taggart, John Stamos as intern Tony Gates, David Lyons as Dr. Simon Brenner and Angela Bassett as Dr. Catherine Banfield.In addition to the main cast, ER featured a large number of frequently seen recurring cast members who played key roles such as paramedics, hospital support staff, nurses, and doctors. ER also featured a sizable roster of well-known guest stars, some making rare television appearances, who typically played patients in single episode appearances or multi-episode arcs.\n\nEpisodes\nA typical episode centered on the ER, with most scenes set in the hospital or surrounding streets. In addition, most seasons included at least one storyline located completely outside of the ER, often outside of Chicago. Over the span of the series, stories took place in the Democratic Republic of The Congo, France, Iraq and Sudan. One early storyline involved a road trip taken by Dr. Ross and Dr. Greene to California and a season eight episode included a storyline in Hawaii featuring Dr. Greene and Dr. Corday. Beginning in season nine, storylines started to include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, featuring Dr. Kovac, Dr. Carter, and Dr. Pratt. \"We turned some attention on the Congo and on Darfur when nobody else was. We had a bigger audience than a nightly newscast will ever see, making 25 to 30 million people aware of what was going on in Africa,\" ER producer John Wells said. \"The show is not about telling people to eat their vegetables, but if we can do that in an entertaining context, then there's nothing better.\" The series also focused on sociopolitical issues such as HIV and AIDS, organ transplants, mental illness, racism, human trafficking, euthanasia, poverty and gay rights.Some episodes used creative formats, such as the 1997 \"Ambush\", which was broadcast live twice, once for the east coast and again three hours later for the west coast, and 2002's \"Hindsight\", which ran in reverse time as it followed one character, Dr. Kovac, through the events of a Christmas Eve shift and the Christmas party that preceded it.\n\nCrossover with Third Watch\nThe episode \"Brothers and Sisters\" (first broadcast on April 25, 2002) begins a crossover that concludes on the Third Watch episode \"Unleashed\" in which Dr. Lewis enlists the help of Officers Maurice Boscorelli and Faith Yokas to find her sister and niece.\n\nRatings\nU.S. seasonal rankings based on average total viewers per episode of ER on NBC are tabulated below.  Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps. All times mentioned in this section were in the Eastern and Pacific time zones. Ratings for seasons 1\u20132 are listed in households (the percentage of households watching the program), while ratings for seasons 3\u201315 are listed in viewers.\n\nIn its first year, ER attracted an average of 19 million viewers per episode, becoming the year's second most watched television show, just behind Seinfeld. In the following two seasons (1995\u20131997), ER was the most watched show in North America. For almost five years, ER battled for the top spot against Seinfeld, but in 1998, Seinfeld ended and then ER became number one again. The series finale attracted 16.4 million viewers. The show's highest rating came during the season 2 episode \"Hell and High Water,\" with 48 million viewers and a 45% market share. It was the highest for a regularly scheduled drama since a May 1985 installment of Dallas received a 46. The share represents the percentage of TVs in use tuned in to that show.\n\nCritical reception\nThroughout the series ER received positive reviews from critics and fans alike. It scored 80 on Metacritic, meaning \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 21 critics. Marvin Kitman from Newsday said: \"It's like M*A*S*H with just the helicopters showing up and no laughs. E.R. is all trauma; you never get to know enough about the patients or get involved with them. It's just treat, release and move on\". Richard Zoglin from Time stated that it's \"probably the most realistic fictional treatment of the medical profession TV has ever presented\".\nCritical reactions for ER's first season were very favorable. Alan Rich, writing for Variety, praised the direction and editing of the pilot while Eric Mink, writing for the New York Daily News, said that the pilot of ER \"was urban, emergency room chaos and young, committed doctors.\" However some reviewers felt the episodes following the pilot did not live up to it with Mink commenting that \"the great promise of the \"E.R.\" pilot dissolves into the kind of routine, predictable, sloppily detailed medical drama we've seen many times before.\"NBC launched the show at the same time that CBS launched its own medical drama Chicago Hope; many critics drew comparisons between the two. Eric Mink concluded that ER may rate more highly in the Nielsens but Chicago Hope told better stories, while Rich felt both shows were \"riveting, superior TV fare.\" The Daily Telegraph wrote in 1996: \"Not being able to follow what on earth is going on remains one of the peculiar charms of the breakneck American hospital drama, ER\".In 2002, TV Guide ranked ER No. 22 on their list of \"TV's Top 50 Shows\", making it the second highest ranked medical drama on the list (after St. Elsewhere at No. 20). Also, the season 1 episode \"Love's Labor Lost\" was ranked No. 6 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time list having earlier been ranked No. 3. The show placed No. 19 on Entertainment Weekly's \"New TV Classics\" list. British magazine Empire ranked it No. 29 in their list of the \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\" and said the best episode was \"Hell And High Water\" (Season 2, Episode 7) where \"Doug Ross (George Clooney) saves a young boy from drowning during a flood.\" In 2012, ER was voted Best TV Drama on ABC's 20\/20 special episode \"Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time\". In 2013, TV Guide ranked it No. 9 in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time and No. 29 in its list of the 60 Best Series. In the same year, the Writers Guild of America ranked ER No. 28 in its list of the 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time.\n\nAwards and nominations\nThe series has been nominated for 375 industry awards and has won 116. ER won the George Foster Peabody Award in 1995, and won 22 of the 124 Emmy Awards for which it was nominated. It also won the People's Choice Award for \"Favorite Television Dramatic Series\" every year from 1995 to 2002. Over the years, it has won numerous other awards, including Screen Actors Guild Awards, Image Awards, GLAAD Media Awards, and Golden Globe Awards, among others.\n\nDistribution\nHome media\nWarner Home Video has released all 15 seasons in R1, R2, and R4.\nIn the UK (Region 2), The Complete Series boxset was released on October 26, 2009. On September 12, 2016 the series was re-released in three box sets, Seasons 1\u20135, Seasons 6\u201310 and Seasons 11\u201315.\nThe DVD box sets of ER are unusual in the fact that they are all in anamorphic widescreen even though the first six seasons of the show were broadcast in a standard 4:3 format. ER was shot protecting for widescreen presentation, allowing the show to be presented in 16:9 open matte (leaving only the title sequence in the 4:3 format). However, as the production of the show was generally conceived with 4:3 presentation in mind, some episodes feature vignetting or unintended objects towards the sides of the frame that would not be visible when presented in the 4:3 format. These episodes also appear in the widescreen format when rerun on TNT HD, Pop and streaming services.\nIn 2018 Hulu struck a deal with Warner Bros Domestic Television Distribution to stream all 15 seasons of the show. The show arrived on HBO Max in January 2022.\n\nSoundtrack\nIn 1996, Atlantic Records released an album of music from the first two seasons, featuring James Newton Howard's theme from the series in its on-air and full versions, selections from the weekly scores composed by Martin Davich (Howard scored the two-hour pilot, Davich scored all the subsequent episodes and wrote a new theme used from 2006\u20132009 until the final episode, when Howard's original theme returned) and songs used on the series.\nTheme From ER \u2013 James Newton Howard (3:02)\nDr. Lewis And Renee (from \"The Birthday Party\") (1:57)\nCanine Blues (from \"Make of Two Hearts\") (2:27)\nGoodbye Baby Susie (from \"Fever of Unknown Origin\") (3:11)\nDoug & Carol (from \"The Gift\") \u2013 composed by James Newton Howard and Martin Davich (1:59)\nHealing Hands \u2013 Marc Cohn (4:25)\nThe Hero (from \"Hell And High Water\") composed by James Newton Howard and Martin Davich (1:55)\nCarter, See You Next Fall (from \"Everything Old Is New Again\") (1:28)\nReasons For Living \u2013 Duncan Sheik (4:33)\nDr. Green and a Mother's Death (from \"Love's Labor Lost\") (2:48)\nRaul Dies (from \"The Healers\") (2:20)\nHell And High Water (from \"Hell And High Water\") \u2013 composed by James Newton Howard and Martin Davich (2:38)\nHold On (from \"Hell And High Water\") (2:47)\nShep Arrives (from \"The Healers\") (3:37)\nShattered Glass (from \"Hell And High Water\") (2:11)\nTheme From ER \u2013 James Newton Howard  (1:00)\nIt Came Upon A Midnight Clear \u2013 Mike Finnegan (2:30)\n\nOther media\nAn ER video game developed by Legacy Interactive for Windows 2000 and XP was released in 2005.\nIn the Mad episode \"Pok\u00e9mon Park \/ WWER\", the show was parodied in the style of WWE.\nA recurring sketch called \"Toy ER\" in the Nickelodeon comedy series All That parodies the show, featuring Dr. Malady (Chelsea Brummet), Dr. Botch (Giovonnie Samuels), and Dr. Sax (Shane Lyons) \"treating\" damaged toys.\nA book about emergency medicine based on the TV series, The Medicine of ER: An Insider's Guide to the Medical Science Behind America's #1 TV Drama was published in 1996. Authors Alan Duncan Ross and Harlan Gibbs M.D. have hospital administration and ER experience, respectively, and are called fans of the TV show in the book's credits.\n\nForeign adaptations\nIn March 2012, Warner Bros. International Television announced that they would sell the format rights to ER to overseas territories. This allowed foreign countries to produce their own version of the series.In June 2013, Warner Bros. International Television and Emotion Production from Belgrade, Serbia, announced a Serbian version of ER. Urgentni Centar premiered on October 6, 2014, on TV Prva.

Here, we report the generation of unsubstituted indeno[1,2-a]fluorene, the final and yet unreported parent indenofluorene regioisomer, on various surfaces by cleavage of two C-H bonds in 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene through voltage pulses applied by the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope.\nOn bilayer NaCl on Au(111), indeno[1,2a]fluorene is in the neutral charge state, while it exhibits charge bistability between neutral and anionic states on the lower work function surfaces of bilayer NaCl on Ag(111) and Cu(111). In the neutral state, indeno[1,2-a]fluorene exhibits either of two ground states: an open-shell \u03c0-diradical state, predicted to be a triplet by density functional and multireference many-body perturbation theory calculations, or a closedshell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety in the as-indacene core.\nSwitching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule is observed by changing its adsorption site on NaCl. The inclusion of non-benzenoid carbocyclic rings is a viable route to tune the physicochemical properties of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) . Non-benzenoid polycycles may lead to local changes in strain, conjugation, aromaticity, and, relevant to the context of the present work, induce an open-shell ground state of the corresponding PCHs .\nMany nonbenzenoid PCHs are also non-alternant, where the presence of odd-membered polycycles breaks the bipartite symmetry of the molecular network . Figure shows classical examples of non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs, namely, pentalene, azulene and heptalene. Whereas azulene is a stable PCH exhibiting H\u00fcckel aromaticity ([4n+2] \u03c0-electrons, n = 2), pentalene and heptalene are unstable H\u00fcckel antiaromatic compounds with [4n] \u03c0-electrons, n = 2 (pentalene) and n = 3 (heptalene).\nBenzinterposition of pentalene generates indacenes, consisting of two isomers s-indacene and as-indacene (Fig. ). Apart from being antiaromatic, indacenes also contain proaromatic quinodimethane (QDM) moieties (Fig. ) , which endows them with potential open-shell character. While the parent s-indacene and asindacene have never been isolated, stable derivatives of s-indacene bearing bulky substituents have been synthesized .\nA feasible strategy to isolate congeners of otherwise unstable non-benzenoid non-alternant PCHs is through fusion of benzenoid rings at the ends of the \u03c0-system, that is, benzannelation. For example, while the parent pentalene is unstable, the benzannelated congener indeno[2,1-a]indene is stable under ambient conditions (Fig. ) .\nHowever, the position of benzannelation is crucial for stability: although indeno[2,1a]indene is stable, its regioisomer indeno[1,2-a]indene (Fig. ) oxidizes under ambient conditions . Similarly, benzannelation of indacenes gives rise to the family of PCHs known as indenofluorenes (Fig. ), which constitute the topic of the present work.\nDepending on the benzannelation position and the indacene core, five regioisomers can be constructed, namely, indeno [ Practical interest in indenofluorenes stems from their low frontier orbital gap and excellent electrochemical characteristics that render them as useful components in organic electronic devices .\nThe potential open-shell character of indenofluorenes has led to several theoretical studies on their use as non-linear optical materials and as candidates for singlet fission in organic photovoltaics . Recent theoretical work has also shown that indenofluorene-based ladder polymers may exhibit fractionalized excitations.\nFundamentally, indenofluorenes represent model systems to study the interplay between aromaticity and magnetism at the molecular scale . Motivated by many of these prospects, the last decade has witnessed intensive synthetic efforts toward the realization of indenofluorenes. Derivatives of 1-4 have been realized in solution , while 1-3 have also been synthesized on surfaces and characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provide information on molecular orbital densities , molecular structure and oxidation state .\nWith regards to the open-shell character of indenofluorenes, 2-4 are theoretically and experimentally interpreted to be closed-shell, while calculations indicate that 1 and 5 should exhibit open-shell ground states . Bulk characterization of mesitylsubstituted 1, including X-ray crystallography, temperature-dependent NMR, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, provided indications of its open-shell ground state .\nElectronic characterization of 1 on Au(111) surface using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) revealed a low electronic gap of 0.4 eV (ref. ). However, no experimental proof of an openshell ground state of 1 on Au(111), such as detection of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) or spin excitations and correlations due to unpaired electrons , was shown.\nIn this work, we report the generation and characterization of unsubstituted 5. Our research is motivated by theoretical calculations that indicate 5 to exhibit the largest diradical character among all indenofluorene isomers . The same calculations also predict that 5 should possess a triplet ground state.\nTherefore, 5 would qualify as a Kekul\u00e9 triplet, of which only a handful of examples exist . However, definitive synthesis of 5 has never been reported so far. Previously, Dressler et al. reported transient isolation of mesityl-substituted 5, where it decomposed both in the solution and in solid state , and only the structural proof of the corresponding dianion was obtained.\nOn-surface generation of a derivative of 5, starting from truxene as a precursor, was recently reported . STM data on this compound, containing the indeno[1,2-a]fluorene moiety as part of a larger PCH, was interpreted to indicate its open-shell ground state. However, the results did not imply the ground state of unsubstituted 5. Here, we show that on insulating surfaces 5 can exhibit either of two ground states: an open-shell or a closed-shell.\nWe infer the existence of these two ground states based on high-resolution AFM imaging with bond-order discrimination and STM imaging of molecular orbital densities . AFM imaging reveals molecules with two different geometries. Characteristic bond-order differences in the two geometries concur with the geometry of either an open-or a closed-shell state.\nConcurrently, STM images at ionic resonances show molecular orbital densities corresponding to SOMOs for the open-shell geometry, but orbital densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the closed-shell geometry. Our experimental results are in good agreement with density functional theory (DFT) and multireference perturbation theory calculations.\nFinally, we observe switching between open-and closed-shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on the surface. Synthetic strategy toward indeno[1,2-a]fluorene. The generation of 5 relies on the solution-phase synthesis of the precursor 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (6). Details on synthesis and characterization of 6 are reported in Supplementary Figs.\n. Single molecules of 6 are deposited on coinage metal (Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111)) or insulator surfaces. In our work, insulating surfaces correspond to two monolayer-thick (denoted as bilayer) NaCl on coinage metal surfaces. Voltage pulses ranging between 4-6 V are applied by the tip of a combined STM\/AFM system, which result in cleavage of one C-H bond at each of the pentagonal apices of 6, thereby leading to the generation of 5 (Fig. ).\nIn the main text, we focus on the generation and characterization of 5 on insulating surfaces. Generation and characterization of 5 on coinage metal surfaces is shown in Supplementary Fig. . ).

The bright and dark features in the trilayer NaCl island in g correspond to Cl -and Na + ions, respectively.\nScale bars: 10 \u00c5 (f) and 5 \u00c5 (g). To experimentally explore the electronic structure of 5, we used bilayer NaCl films on coinage metal surfaces to electronically decouple the molecule from the metal surfaces. Before presenting the experimental findings, we summarize the results of our theoretical calculations performed on 5 in the neutral charge state (denoted as 5 0 ).\nWe start by performing DFT calculations on 5 0 in the gas phase. Geometry optimization performed at the spin-unrestricted UB3LYP\/6-31G level of theory leads to one local minimum, 5OS, the geometry of which corresponds to the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. , the label OS denotes open-shell).\nThe triplet electronic configuration of 5OS is the lowest-energy state, with the openshell singlet configuration 90 meV higher in energy. Geometry optimization performed at the restricted closed-shell RB3LYP\/6-31G level reveals two local minima, 5para and 5ortho, the geometries of which (Fig. ) exhibit bond length alternations in line with the presence of a para-or an ortho-QDM moiety, respectively, in the as-indacene core of the closed-shell resonance structures of 5 (Fig. ) .\nRelative to 5OS in the triplet configuration, 5para and 5ortho are 0.40 and 0.43 eV higher in energy, respectively. Additional DFT results are shown in Supplementary Fig. . To gain more accurate insights into the theoretical electronic structure of 5, we performed multireference perturbation theory calculations (Supplementary Fig. ) based on quasi-degenerate second-order n-electron valence state perturbation theory (QD-NEVPT2).\nIn so far as the order of the ground and excited states are concerned, the results of QD-NEVPT2 calculations qualitatively match with DFT calculations. For 5OS, the triplet configuration remains the lowest-energy state, with the open-shell singlet configuration 60 meV higher in energy. The energy differences between the open-and closed-shell states are substantially reduced in QD-NEVPT2 calculations, with 5para and 5ortho only 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy, respectively, compared to 5OS in the triplet configuration.\nWe also performed nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations to probe local aromaticity of 5 in the openand closed-shell states. While 5OS in the triplet configuration exhibits local aromaticity at the terminal benzenoid rings, 5OS in the open-shell singlet configuration, 5para and 5ortho all display antiaromaticity (Supplementary Fig. ).\nThe choice of the insulating surface determines the charge state of 5: while 5 adopts neutral charge state on the high work function bilayer NaCl\/Au(111) surface (irrespective of its openor closed-shell state, Supplementary Fig. ), 5 exhibits charge bistability between 5 0 and the anionic state 5 -1 on the lower work function bilayer NaCl\/Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces (Supplementary Figs. ).\nIn the main text, we focus on the characterization of 5 on bilayer NaCl\/Au(111). Characterization of charge bistable 5 is reported in Supplementary Figs. . We first describe experiments on 5 on bilayer NaCl\/Au(111), where 5 exhibits a geometry corresponding to the calculated 5OS geometry, and an open-shell electronic configuration.\nWe compare the experimental data on this species to calculations on 5OS with a triplet configuration, as theory predicts a triplet ground state for 5OS. For 5OS, the calculated frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs \u03c81 and \u03c82 (Fig. ), whose spin up levels are occupied and the spin down levels are empty.\nFigure shows the DFT-calculated bond lengths of 5OS, where the two salient features, namely, the small difference in the bond lengths within each ring and the notably longer bond lengths in the pentagonal rings, agree with the open-shell resonance structure of 5 (Fig. ). Figure shows an AFM image of 5 adsorbed on bilayer NaCl\/Au(111) that we assign as 5OS, where the bond-order differences qualitatively correspond to the calculated 5OS geometry (discussed and compared to the closed-shell state below).\nDifferential conductance spectra (dI\/dV(V), where I and V denote the tunneling current and bias voltage, respectively) acquired on assigned 5OS exhibit two peaks centered at -1.5 V and 1.6 V (Fig. ), which we assign to the positive and negative ion resonances (PIR and NIR), respectively. Figure shows the corresponding STM images acquired at the onset (V = -1.2\nV\/1.3 V) and the peak (V = -1.5 V\/1.6 V) of the ionic resonances. To draw a correspondence between the STM images and the molecular orbital densities, we consider tunneling events as many-body electronic transitions between different charge states of 5OS (Fig. ). Within this framework, the PIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and the cationic state 5 .\nAt the onset of the PIR at -1.2 V, an electron can only be detached from the SOMO \u03c81 and the corresponding STM image at -1.2 V shows the orbital density of \u03c81. Increasing the bias to the peak of the PIR at -1.5 V, it becomes possible to also empty the SOMO \u03c82, such that the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of \u03c81 and \u03c82, that is, |\u03c81| 2 + |\u03c82| 2 (ref.\n). Similarly, the NIR corresponds to transitions between 5 0 and 5 -1 . At the NIR onset of 1.3 V, only electron attachment to \u03c82 is energetically possible. At 1.6 V, electron attachment to \u03c81 also becomes possible, and the corresponding STM image shows the superposition of \u03c81 and \u03c82. The observation of the orbital densities of SOMOs, and not the hybridized HOMO and LUMO, proves the open-shell ground state of assigned 5OS.\nMeasurements of the monoradical species with a doublet ground state are shown in Supplementary Fig. . Unexpectedly, another species of 5 was also experimentally observed that exhibited a closedshell ground state. In contrast to 5OS, where the frontier orbitals correspond to the SOMOs \u03c81 and \u03c82, DFT calculations predict orbitals of different shapes and symmetries for 5para and 5ortho, denoted as \u03b1 and \u03b2 and shown in Fig. .\nFor 5ortho, \u03b1 and \u03b2 correspond to HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The orbitals are inverted in energy and occupation for 5para, where \u03b2 is the HOMO and \u03b1 is the LUMO. Fig. shows an AFM image of 5 that we assign as 5para. We experimentally infer its closed-shell state first by using qualitative bond order discrimination by AFM.\nIn high-resolution AFM imaging, chemical bonds with higher bond order are imaged brighter (that is, with higher frequency shift \u0394f) due to stronger repulsive forces, and they appear shorter . In Fig. , we label seven bonds whose bond orders show significant qualitative differences in the calculated 5ortho, 5para (Fig. ) and 5OS (Fig. ) geometries.\nIn 5para, the bonds b and d exhibit a higher bond order than a and c, respectively. This pattern is reversed for 5ortho, while the bond orders of the bonds a-d are all similar and small for 5OS. Furthermore, in 5para bond f exhibits a higher bond order than e, while in 5ortho and 5OS bonds e and f exhibit similar bond order (because they belong to Clar sextets).\nFinally, the bond labeled g shows a higher bond order in 5para than in 5ortho and 5OS. The AFM image of assigned 5para shown in Fig. indicates higher bond orders of the bonds b, d and f compared to a, c and e, respectively. In addition, the bond g appears almost point-like and with enhanced \u0394f contrast compared to its neighboring bonds, indicative of a high bond order (see Supplementary Fig. for height-dependent measurements).\nThese observations concur with the calculated 5para geometry (Fig. ). Importantly, all these distinguishing bond-order differences are distinctly different in the AFM image of 5OS shown in Fig. , which is consistent with the calculated 5OS geometry (Fig. ). In the AFM images of 5OS (Fig. and Supplementary Fig. ), the bonds a-d at the pentagon apices appear with similar contrast and apparent bond length.\nThe bonds e and f at one of the terminal benzenoid rings also exhibit similar contrast and apparent bond length, while the central bond g appears longer compared to assigned 5para. Further compelling evidence for the closed-shell state of assigned 5para is obtained by STM and STS. dI\/dV(V) spectra acquired on an assigned 5para species exhibit two peaks centered at -1.4 V (PIR) and 1.6 V (NIR) (Fig. ).\nSTM images acquired at these biases (Fig. ) show the orbital densities of \u03b2 (-1.4 V) and \u03b1 (1.6 V). First, the observation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 as the frontier orbitals of this species, and not the SOMOs, strongly indicates its closed-shell state. Second, consistent with AFM measurements that indicate good correspondence to the calculated 5para geometry, we observe \u03b2 as the HOMO and \u03b1 as the LUMO.\nFor 5ortho, \u03b1 should be observed as the HOMO and \u03b2 as the LUMO. We did not observe molecules with the signatures of 5ortho in our experiments. We observed molecules in open-(5OS, Fig. ) and closed-shell (5para, Fig. ) states in similar occurrence after their generation from 6 on the surface. We could also switch individual molecules between open-and closed-shell states as shown in Fig. and Supplementary Fig. .\nTo this end, a change in the adsorption site of a molecule was induced by STM imaging at ionic resonances, which often resulted in movement of the molecule. The example presented in Fig. shows a molecule that was switched from 5para to 5OS and back to 5para. The switching is not directed, that is, we cannot choose which of the two species will be formed when changing the adsorption site, and we observed 5OS and 5para in approximately equal yields upon changing the adsorption site.\nThe molecule in Fig. is adsorbed on top of a defect that stabilizes its adsorption geometry on bilayer NaCl. At defect-free adsorption sites on bilayer NaCl, that is, without a third layer NaCl island or atomic defects in the vicinity of the molecule, 5 could be stably imaged neither by AFM nor by STM at ionic resonances (Supplementary Fig. ).\nWithout changing the adsorption site, the state of 5 (open-or closedshell) never changed, including the experiments on bilayer NaCl\/Ag(111) and Cu(111), on which the charge state of 5 could be switched (Supplementary Figs. ). Also on these lower work function surfaces, both open-and closed-shell species were observed for 5 0 and both showed charge bistability between 5 0 (5OS or 5para) and 5 -1 (Supplementary Figs. ).\nThe geometrical structure of 5 -1 probed by AFM, and its electronic structure probed by STM imaging at the NIR (corresponding to transitions between 5 -1 and the dianionic state 5 -2 ), are identical within the measurement accuracy for the charged species of both 5OS and 5para. When cycling the charge state of 5 between 5 0 and 5 -1 several times, we always observed the same state (5OS or 5para) when returning to 5 0 , provided the molecule did not move during the charging\/discharging process.\nBased on our experimental observations we conclude that indeno[1,2-a]fluorene (5), the last unknown indenofluorene isomer, can be stabilized in and switched between an open-shell (5OS) and a closed-shell (5para) state on NaCl. For the former, both DFT and QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict a triplet electronic configuration.\nTherefore, 5 can be considered to exhibit the spin-crossover effect, involving magnetic switching between high-spin (5OS) and low-spin (5para) states, coupled with a reversible structural transformation. So far, the spin-crossover effect has mainly only been observed in transition-metal-based coordination compounds with a near-octahedral geometry .\nThe observation that the switching between open-and closedshell states is related to changes in the adsorption site but is not achieved by charge-state cycling alone, indicates that the NaCl surface and local defects facilitate different electronic configurations of 5 depending on the adsorption site.\nGas-phase QD-NEVPT2 calculations predict that 5OS is the ground state, and the closed-shell 5para and 5ortho states are 0.11 and 0.21 eV higher in energy. The experiments, showing bidirectional switching between 5OS and 5para, indicate that a change in the adsorption site can induce sufficient change in the geometry of 5 (leading to a corresponding change in the ground state electronic configuration) and thus induce switching.\nSwitching between open-and closed-shell states in 5 does not require the breaking or formation of covalent bonds , but a change of adsorption site on NaCl where the molecule is physisorbed. Our results should have implications for single-molecule devices, capitalizing on the altered electronic and chemical properties of a system in \u03c0-diradical open-shell and closed-shell states such as frontier orbital and singlet-triplet gaps, and chemical reactivity.\nFor possible future applications as a single-molecule switch, it might be possible to also switch between open-and closed-shell states by changing the local electric field, such as by using chargeable adsorbates . Scanning probe microscopy measurements and sample preparation. STM and AFM measurements were performed in a home-built system operating at base pressures below 1\u00d710 -10 mbar and a base temperature of 5 K. Bias voltages are provided with respect to the sample.\nAll STM, AFM and spectroscopy measurements were performed with carbon monoxide (CO) functionalized tips. AFM measurements were performed in non-contact mode with a qPlus sensor . The sensor was operated in frequency modulation mode with a constant oscillation amplitude of 0.5 \u00c5. STM measurements were performed in constantcurrent mode, AFM measurements were performed in constant-height mode with V = 0 V, and I(V) and \u0394f(V) spectra were acquired in constant-height mode.\nPositive (negative) values of the tip-height offset \u0394z represent tip approach (retraction) from the STM setpoint. All dI\/dV(V) spectra are obtained by numerical differentiation of the corresponding I(V) spectra. STM and AFM images, and spectroscopy curves, were post-processed using Gaussian low-pass filters.\nAu(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces were cleaned by iterative cycles of sputtering with Ne + ions and annealing up to 800 K. NaCl was thermally evaporated on Au(111), Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces held at 323 K, 303 K and 283 K, respectively. This protocol results in the growth of predominantly bilayer (100)-terminated islands, with a minority of trilayer islands.\nSub-monolayer coverage of 6 on surfaces was obtained by flashing an oxidized silicon wafer containing the precursor molecules in front of the cold sample in the microscope. CO molecules for tip functionalization were dosed from the gas phase on the cold sample. Density functional theory calculations. DFT was employed using the PSI4 program package .\nAll molecules with different charge (neutral and anionic) and electronic (open-and closed-shell) states were independently investigated in the gas phase. The B3LYP exchangecorrelation functional with 6-31G basis set was employed for structural relaxation and singlepoint energy calculations. The convergence criteria were set to 10 \u22124 eV \u00c5 \u22121 for the total forces and 10 \u22126 eV for the total energies.\nMultireference calculations. Multireference calculations were performed on the DFToptimized geometries using the QD-NEVPT2 level of theory , with three singlet roots and one triplet root included in the state-averaged calculation. A (10,10) active space (that is, 10 electrons in 10 orbitals) was used along with the def2-TZVP basis set .\nIncreasing either the active space size or expanding the basis set resulted in changes of about 50 meV for relative energies of the singlet and triplet states. These calculations were performed using the ORCA program package . Nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Isotropic nucleus-independent chemical shift values were evaluated at the centre of each ring using the B3LYP exchangecorrelation functional with def2-TZVP basis set using the Gaussian 16 software package .\nStarting materials (reagent grade) were purchased from TCI and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Reactions were carried out in flame-dried glassware and under an inert atmosphere of purified Ar using Schlenk techniques. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Silica Gel 60 F-254 plates (Merck).\nColumn chromatography was performed on silica gel (40-60 \u00b5m). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Varian Mercury 300 or Bruker Varian Inova 500 spectrometers. Mass spectrometry (MS) data were recorded in a Bruker Micro-TOF spectrometer. The synthesis of compound 6 was developed following the two-step synthetic route shown in Supplementary Fig. , which is based on the preparation of methylene-bridge polyarenes by means of Pd-catalyzed activation of benzylic C-H bonds .\nSupplementary Figure | Synthetic route to obtain compound 6. The complex Pd2(dba)3 (20 mg, 0.02 mmol) was added over a deoxygenated mixture of 1,3-dibromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene (9, 100 mg, 0.38 mmol), boronic acid 10 (178 mg, 1.14 mmol), K2CO3 (314 mg, 2.28 mmol) and XPhos (35 mg, 0.08 mmol) in toluene (1:1, 10 mL), and the resulting mixture was heated at 90 \u00b0C for 2 h.\nAfter cooling to room temperature, the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. The reaction crude was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; hexane:CH2Cl2 9:1) affording 11 (94 mg, 76%) as a colorless oil. The complex Pd(OAc)2 (7 mg, 0.03 mmol) was added over a deoxygenated mixture of terphenyl 11 (90 mg, 0.27 mmol), K2CO3 (114 mg, 0.83 mmol) and ligand L (26 mg, 0.06 mmol) in NMP (2 mL).\nThe resulting mixture was heated at 160 \u00b0C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, H2O (30 mL) was added, and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3x15 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The reaction crude was purified by column chromatography (SiO2; hexane:CH2Cl2 9:1) affording compound 6 (8 mg, 11%) as a white solid. in AFM imaging due to their reduced adsorption height compared to the rest of the carbon atoms.\nWe attribute this observation to the significantly different lattice parameter of Cu(111) (2.57 \u00c5) compared to Au(111) and Ag(111) (2.95 \u00c5 and 2.94 \u00c5, respectively) , such that the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings of 5 adsorb on the on-top atomic sites on Au(111) and Ag(111), but not on Cu(111).\nOur speculation is based on a previous study of polymers of 1 on Au(111) by Di Giovannantonio et al. , where both tilted and planar individual units of 1 were observed depending on whether the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings in 1 adsorbed on the on-top or hollow sites of the surface, respectively.\nGiven the strong molecule-metal interaction, we found no electronic state signatures of 5 on all three metal surfaces. STM set point for AFM images: V = 0. e, Frontier orbital spectrum of 5 -1 . In the anionic state, \u03c82 becomes doubly occupied and \u03c81 is the SOMO. Filled and empty circles denote occupied and empty orbitals, respectively.\nFor each panel, zero of the energy axis has been aligned to the respective highest-energy occupied orbital.","label":"longbench","length":9174,"title":"Paper Info"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nLike a Virgin (album)\nLike a Virgin is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Madonna, released on November 12, 1984, by Sire Records. Following the success of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to become the record producer of her next album. However, her label was not ready to give her the artistic freedom and she chose Nile Rodgers instead to produce the album due to his work with David Bowie. Madonna wrote six songs on the record, five of which feature Steve Bray as a co-writer. The album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique introduced at that time.\nThe album's photographs were shot by Steven Meisel. Madonna wanted the album title and the cover image to make a provocative link between her own religious name Madonna, as the Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary, and the Christian concept of the virgin birth. While not a substantial musical departure from Madonna's first album, she felt that the material from Like a Virgin was stronger. After its release, Like a Virgin received mixed reviews from music critics; however, retrospective reviews of the album have been much more positive. Like a Virgin was a commercial success and became Madonna's first number one album on the Billboard 200 and set the record as the first female album in history  to sell over five million copies in the United States. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) later certified it diamond for shipment of ten million units. It also reached number one in Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, and remains one of the best-selling albums of all time with sales of over 21 million copies worldwide.Five singles were released from the album, including Madonna's first US number-one \"Like a Virgin\" and her first UK number-one \"Into the Groove\", the latter of which was introduced on the 1985 international reissue of the album. To promote the album, she embarked on The Virgin Tour, touring North America only. Like a Virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of the 1980s. Madonna proved that she was not a one-hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in the music world. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population, especially \"Material Girl\" and \"Like a Virgin\". According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, \"Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment.\" In 2023, the Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry for preservation in the United States, for being a \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" recording.\n\nBackground\nA former dancer and fixture on the New York club scene, Madonna Ciccone became known to the world simply as Madonna, with the release of her 1983 self-titled debut album Madonna. Fueled by hit songs like \"Holiday\", \"Borderline\" and \"Lucky Star\", the album was one of the best selling of the year and helped Madonna become one of the most exciting new artists of the 1980s. When she started work on her second album, Madonna felt that her first album had succeeded in introducing her \"street-smart dance queen\" persona, and she wanted to solidify and build upon that concept. According to her, \"My work, my dedication\u2014the stubbornness for getting Madonna released\u2014had paid off. Now it was time to solidify my future.\"For Like a Virgin, Madonna attempted to become one of the primary record producers, feeling the need to control the various aspects of her music. She believed that depending on a particular producer for her album was not something that suited her. Madonna said \"I learnt my lesson while creating my debut album, and the way [Reggie, the producer of her debut project] Lucas left me in the water with the project, you can't trust men\"\u2014referring to the incident, when due to a certain difference of opinion between producer Reggie Lucas and Madonna, Lucas had left the project half-way. However, Warner Bros. Records was not ready to give her the artistic freedom that she wanted. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography of Madonna, she commented,\n\nWarner Bros. Records is a hierarchy of old men and it's a chauvinist environment to be working in because I'm treated like this sexy little girl. I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans but to my record company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. I had to do everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince people that I was worth a record deal. After that, I had the same problem trying to convince the record company that I had more to offer than a one-shot singer. I had to win this fight.\nUltimately, Nile Rodgers was chosen by Madonna as the producer of the album, with the approval of the Warner Brothers executives. Madonna chose Rodgers mostly because of his work as a member of the 1970s band Chic, and his most recent production work with David Bowie on his 1983 album Let's Dance. She commented, \"When I was making the record, I was just so thrilled and happy to be working with Nile Rodgers. I idolized Nile because of the whole Chic thing. I couldn't believe that the record company gave me the money so that I could work with him.\"For his part, Rodgers recalled that he had first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: \"I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always wanted to work with her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity.\"\n\nRecording\nThe album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to \"go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning.\" Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: \"I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement when it comes to making pop records. I've never seen anyone do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, it was the perfect union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio. The thing between us, man, it was sexual, it was passionate, it was creativity ... it was pop.\"Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique at the time which Corsaro believed was going to be the future of recording. To ensure this, Corsaro used a Sony 3324 24-track digital tape recorder and a Sony F1 two-track during the mixing of the tracks. Madonna recorded the lead parts of the songs in a small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C, also known as Power Station's \"R&B room\". Corsaro then placed gobos around her while using the top capsule of a stereo AKG C24 tube microphone, with a Schoeps microphone preamplifier and a Pultec equalizer. Once the tracks met with everybody's approval, Robert Sabino added the keyboard parts, playing mostly a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, as well as some Rhodes piano and acoustic piano, while Rodgers also played a Synclavier. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process, Corsaro commented: \"Nile was there most of the time, but she was there all of the time. She never left\".\n\nPackaging and title\nThe cover sleeve and images were shot by Steven Meisel, who would become a regular collaborator with Madonna, in a suite at the St. Regis New York. Madonna wanted the album title to make provocative link between her own religious name\u2014Madonna as the Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary\u2014and the Christian concept of the virgin birth. With the title song alluding to this concept, Madonna wanted the album cover to have mixed messages as well. Author Graham Thompson described that \"reclining on a satin sheet, with a bouquet on her lap and wearing a wedding dress, a closer inspection reveals Madonna's image as highly fetishized and sexualized.\" He added that the heavy make-up, pouting lips, and despoiled hair, along with the tight-fitting bustier and full-length gloves, turned Madonna's image into a figure not of virtue, but of desire. This point, according to Thompson, is further emphasized by the belt she is wearing, the wording on which is just visible as \"Boy Toy\". He added: \"The image was ambiguous and was based upon the fact that Madonna's appeal at that point of her career was not presenting herself just as an object of desire, but also as a desiring female subject\".Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented that the \"Steven Meisel-shot cover ... was as key to her reinvention as the music of the album itself.\" William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and testament to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: \"This was one of the most shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture\/fashion history ... Fashion has never been the same.\" Madonna herself declared: \"I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be\u2014the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so.\"\n\nComposition\nAccording to Taraborrelli, \"Madonna and Rodgers' collective energy\u2014she wanting to score with a smash second album and he wanting to be the producer to give it to her\u2014drove the production of Like a Virgin with great precision.\" Madonna also collaborated with her former boyfriend Steve Bray, who co-wrote many of the album's songs. Reflecting on the music composition for the album, Bray noted: \"I've always kind of made the rib cage and the skeleton of the songs already\u2014she's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut.\" The opening track \"Material Girl\" was written by Peter Brown and Robert Rans. Madonna explained that the concept of the song was similar to her life's situation at that time. According to her, the song was provocative, hence she was attracted to it. \"Material Girl\" incorporated new wave music and consists of synth arrangements with a robotic voice repeating the hook. The lyrics identify with materialism, with Madonna asking for a rich and affluent life, rather than romance and relationships. Written by Madonna and Steve Bray, \"Angel\" is the second track on the album. It was one of the first songs developed for the project and, according to Madonna, was inspired by a girl who is saved by, and subsequently falls in love with an angel. \"Angel\" consists of a three-chord ascending hook, which serves as the verse and chorus. It has vocal harmonies beneath the main chorus and the lyrics repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's savior. The title track \"Like a Virgin\" was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance. It was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records, after listening to a demo sung by Kelly. However, Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a good enough hook and was not suitable for Madonna, but subsequently changed his opinion after the hook was stuck in his mind. He credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential: \"I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know ... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'\" \"Like a Virgin\" is a dance-oriented song, composed of two hooks. Madonna's voice is heard in a high register while a continuous arrangement of drums are heard along the bassline. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous and consist of hidden innuendo. In sexual terms, the lyrics can be interpreted in different ways for different people.In \"Over and Over\", Madonna sings about determination despite disappointments. The song consists of instrumentation from drums, synths and has a three-chord progression. An emotional moment occurred in the recording studio when Madonna covered the 1978 Rose Royce song \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\". Rodgers recalled: \"Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you go out there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record.\" The song features Madonna's vocals supported by acoustic guitars and synth strings, with Thompson playing the drum in the second verse. Towards the end, Madonna emotes in the voice of a soul singer.\"Dress You Up\" was the last track to be added to the album as it was submitted late by songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale. Although Rodgers rejected it as he felt there was no time to compose a melody and record it for the album, Madonna pushed for the song's inclusion on Like a Virgin, as she particularly liked its lyrics. The song is a drum beat-driven dance track featuring instrumentation of guitars and vocals from a choir. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up with passion. \"Shoo-Bee-Doo\" contains homage to Motown music. Beginning with a slow introduction, the song is in the doo-wop genre and resembles the songs of early Sixties girl groups like The Shirelles or The Crystals. The saxophone breakdown is played by Lenny Pickett. The lyrics discuss relationship problems, and are phrased as clich\u00e9s in the coda. \"Pretender\" starts with the chorus and then moves to the verse. It talks about seduction and the insecurity felt by a woman who feels that things are moving too quickly for her with her man. \"Stay\" is the final track on the album. Using triple-rhythms and double-tracked vocals, the song includes a noise resembling someone slapping a microphone and a spoken sequence which fades away in the end.\n\"Into the Groove\" was added as a bonus track in the 1985 international reissue of Like a Virgin. Madonna's inspiration behind the song was the dance floor, and she wrote it while watching a handsome Puerto Rican man across her balcony. Initially written for her friend Mark Kamins, Madonna later decided to use it in the soundtrack of her 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan. Unlike the other songs on Like a Virgin, \"Into the Groove\" was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's Madonna biography, she noted that at one point of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing with the rest of the composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up to the microphone and sang the words \"Live out your fantasy here with me\". Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: \"[The song] seemed to come out of her, I was awestruck.\" The song consists of instrumentation from drums, percussion, congas and whistles. Madonna's voice is double-tracked in the chorus. The lyrics are simple, and written as an invitation to dance with the singer, with sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning.\n\nPromotion\nLive performances\nMadonna debuted the first single \"Like a Virgin\" at the first MTV Video Music Awards on September 14, 1984, where she appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake dressed in a wedding dress, adorned with the infamous \"Boy Toy\" belt buckle, and veil. The climax of her risqu\u00e9 performance found her masturbating and rolling around on the stage. The performance is noted as one of the iconic performance in MTV's history. On December 13, 1984, Madonna performed \"Like a Virgin\" on BBC One's program Top of the Pops, wearing punky torn tights, a vivid pink wig, religious accessories and layered mesh tops. It was later voted as the second best Top of the Pops performance of all time. She also appeared at the 1985 Live Aid charity concert, where she performed \"Into the Groove\".The album was further promoted on her first headlining tour, The Virgin Tour, which only visited cities in the United States and Canada. Early on there were plans to schedule dates in England and Japan due to Madonna's large fan base in both countries. However, the final schedule did not reflect the idea. In the end several more US dates were added and moved to larger concert venues due to overwhelmingly strong ticket sales. Madonna's performance on the tour was described by Taraborrelli as \"full of excitement\", singing songs from her debut album as well as Like a Virgin, and asking the audience \"Will you marry me?\" The costumes included colorful new wave jackets for \"Holiday\" and white wedding gowns similar to the one worn in her \"Like a Virgin\" music video. Referring to her Detroit roots and contemporary artist Michael Jackson, Madonna sang a verse of \"Billie Jean\" during \"Like a Virgin\".The Virgin Tour was a success and collected a total of more than US$5 million. During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, interviewer Austin Scaggs asked Madonna regarding her feelings and emotions during the tour, since it was the first time she was playing in arenas. Madonna replied saying,\n\nThat whole tour was crazy, because I went from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing sporting arenas. I played a small theater in Seattle, and the girls had flap skirts on and the tights cut off below their knees and lace gloves and rosaries and bows in their hair and big hoop earrings. I was like, 'This is insane!' After Seattle, all of the shows were moved to arenas. I've never done a bus tour. Everyone says they are really fun.\n\nSingles\n\"Like a Virgin\" was released as the lead single from the album in late 1984. It received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who frequently called it one of Madonna's defining songs. It became her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Canada and Japan and the top-ten of other countries. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 10, 1985, for shipping a million copies across United States \u2013 the requirement for a gold single prior to 1989. The music video portrayed Madonna sailing down the riverways of Venice in a gondola, as well as roaming around a palace wearing a white wedding dress. With the video, scholars noted Madonna's portrayal of a sexually independent woman, the symbolism of the appearance of a man with lion's mask to that of Saint Mark, and compared the eroticism of the video to the vitality of the city of Venice.\"Material Girl\" was the second single from the album, released in November 1984. Critics have frequently noted \"Material Girl\" and \"Like a Virgin\" as the songs that made Madonna an icon. The song was a commercial success, reaching the top-five in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Japan and United Kingdom. It reached position two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. The music video was a mimicry of Marilyn Monroe's performance of the song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" from the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The mimicked scenes are interspersed with scenes of a Hollywood producer trying to win the heart of an actress, played by Madonna herself. Discovering that, contrary to her song, the young woman was not impressed by money and expensive gifts, he pretended to be penniless and succeeded in taking her out on a date.\"Angel\" was the third released single from the album, in April 1985. Critics gave mixed review of the song, with one group denoting it as a classic while the others felt it was sub-par compared to the other Madonna singles. \"Angel\" became Madonna's fifth consecutive top-five single on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top of its dance chart.\"Into the Groove\"  was released as a single in Europe, Asia and South America in July 1985. The song was appreciated by contemporary critics as well as authors, who have frequently called it \"Madonna's first great single\". \"Into the Groove\" reached the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, where it was Madonna's first number-one single. In the United States, the song was only available as the B-side of the 12-inch single of \"Angel\", therefore it was ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time. It reached number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart where it was listed as a double-sided single with \"Angel\". In Australia and Canada, the song also was released as a double-sided single with, \"Angel\".\n\"Dress You Up\" was the last single from the album. Critics reacted positively to the dance-pop nature of the track. \"Dress You Up\" became Madonna's sixth consecutive top-five single in the United States. It also reached the top-ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The music video for the single is taken from the live performance from The Virgin Tour, filmed in Detroit.Two further singles were released internationally from the album. \"Over and Over\" was released in late 1985 exclusively in Italy.\n\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" was released in early 1986 exclusively in Japan.\n\nCritical reception\nAccording to Q magazine, Like a Virgin was the album that \"propelled [Madonna] into the stratosphere \u2013 and rightly so. The songs are smart, funny, sexy and irresistible.\" Taraborrelli said, \"It was Like a Virgin which reflected Madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in the music industry.\" Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the songs on the album sustain a \"fevered dance-rock momentum\". In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented, \"Overall, the album adds up to less than the sum of its parts\u2014partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence\u2014even something that makes her fun\u2014it throws the record's balance off a little too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star.\" Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album over Like a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing \"[Madonna's] so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical, she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy.\"Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly said that \"In addition to raising the Madonna\/whore ante with songs like the title cut, Virgin cradled the kind of '80s hits (\"Dress You Up\") built to transcend the Dynasty era.\" Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine remembered the first time that he heard the songs from the album and commented, \"Lots of critics think something similar occurred when Madonna followed her eponymous debut with Like a Virgin, helmed by Nile Rodgers with all the fixin's\u2014too calculated next to the 'raw passion' of the debut. This is nonsense; it misses how Madonna conflated notions of spontaneity and calculation. Rodgers is the ideal collaborator.\" Stephen Holden from The New York Times said: \"With a tough-cookie voice that's both coy and streetwise, Madonna's singing harks back to the rock-and-roll girl-group tradition that preceded the Beatles. But where girl groups, from the Shirelles to the Ronettes, worshipfully extolled their boyfriends' cars, haircuts and rebel poses, Madonna's point of view is decidedly more self-interested. In matters of love, she is a comparison shopper with a shrewd sense of her own market value. The words 'shiny and new' describe not only the way the love-smitten singer feels in the title song but the sound of the album.\"Matt Damsker from the Los Angeles Times commented: \"Madonna's beating vibrato sometimes makes her sound so robotic in the album.\" Lou Papineau, while writing for The Providence Journal, said that \"In Like a Virgin, Madonna proves she's shallow, but spunky.\" Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a positive review, saying \"Though not as innovative as her debut, Like a Virgin stands as one of the most definitive pop artifacts from the indulgent Reagan Era. The mid-tempo ballad 'Shoo-Bee-Doo' and a soulful cover of Rose Royce's 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' proved Madonna could churn out more than just novelty hits, while the sugary 'Angel' and the irresistible 'Dress You Up' contributed to the singer's record-breaking list of consecutive Top 5 hits (16 in all). The retro-infused 'Stay' and the percussive 'Over and Over' are the album's hidden gems.\" Ed Stevenson from People felt that \"Madonna does have a sense of humor, though she is buried under so many layers of self-parody it's hard to tell sometimes ... She is backed on this by the reliable rhythmic touch of veteran Nile Rodgers, whose contributions have helped her create a tolerable bit of fluff. Hugo Mistry from the Chicago Tribune felt that \"Like a Virgin was Madonna's breakthrough, playing off her self-conscious campiness with a series of hot dance tracks, attention-grabbing lyrics and steamy videos.\"\n\nCommercial performance\nLike a Virgin was recorded and finished by September 1984, but the release of the album was held up, much to Madonna's frustration, by the continuing sales of her debut album, which was approaching two million sales in the United States. Like a Virgin debuted at number 70 on the Billboard 200 issued for December 1, 1984. The album reached the top ten of the Billboard 200 on December 8, 1984, and after one month reached the top of the chart on February 9, 1985, where it stayed for three weeks. It also reached a peak of ten on the Top R&B\/Hip-Hop Albums chart. After 14 weeks, the album sold 3.5 million copies. By July 1985, Like a Virgin became the first album by a female artist to be certified for sales of five million units in the United States. It was eventually certified ten times platinum (diamond) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipment of ten million copies of the album. It placed at three on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna becoming the top pop artist for the year. After the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 574,000 copies. It sold additional 882,000 units at the BMG Music Club, which are not counted by the Nielsen SoundScan. In Canada, the album debuted at number 78 on the RPM Albums Chart, on November 10, 1984. It reached a peak of number three, on February 16, 1985. The album was present for a total of 74 weeks on the chart, and was certified diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), for shipment of one million copies of the album. Like a Virgin ranked sixth on the RPM Top 100 Albums for 1985. As of June 1986, the album sold more than 750,000 units in Latin America.In the United Kingdom, Like a Virgin debuted at number 74 on the UK Albums Chart, on January 12, 1985. However, the album fluctuated on the chart for the next eight months and it was only in September that it finally reached the top of the chart. It spent two alternative weeks at the top (21st Sept and 12th Oct 1985), and a total of 152 weeks on the chart. The album was certified three times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and has sold over a million copies there. In France, the album debuted at number five on the French Albums Chart on October 6, 1985, staying there for eight weeks, then descending down the chart. It was certified two times platinum by the Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique (SNEP) for shipment of 600,000 copies. In Australia, the album debuted and peaked at two on the Kent Music Report albums chart, and was certified seven times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 490,000 copies of the album. It reached the top of the New Zealand Albums Chart for three consecutive weeks and was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for shipment of 75,000 copies. Elsewhere, Like a Virgin reached number one in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, while peaking within the top five in many other countries, including Austria, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland. It also became Madonna's first number-one album on the European Top 100 Albums, reaching the summit on November 23, 1985, for two weeks, and sold over 2 million copies across Europe at the end of the 1985 year. Like a Virgin has sold more than 21 million copies worldwide and became one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nLegacy\nAfter the release of Like a Virgin, Stephen Holden commented in The New York Times: \"No phenomenon illustrates more pointedly how pop music history seems to run in cycles than the overnight success of the 24-year-old pop siren known as Madonna. The month before Christmas, Madonna's second album, Like a Virgin sold more than two million copies. Teen-agers were lining up in stores to purchase the album the way their parents had lined up to buy Beatles records in the late 60's.\" Madonna proved she was not a one-hit wonder with the release of the album which sold 12 million copies worldwide at the time of its release. In 2016, Billboard ranked at number nine in the list of Certified Diamond Albums From Worst to Best. Like a Virgin was ranked fifth in a Billboard poll of albums of the decade\u2014the highest peak by a female performer. In 2023, the Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry for preservation in the United States, for being an \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" recording.\nTaraborrelli felt that \"Like a Virgin is really a portrait of Madonna's uncanny pop instincts empowered by her impatient zeal for creative growth and her innate knack for crafting a good record.\" He added that the success of the album made it clear what was Madonna's real persona. \"She was a street-smart dance queen with the sexy allure of Marilyn Monroe, the coy iciness of Marlene Dietrich and the cutting and protective glibness of a modern Mae West\". Although the album received mixed reviews, Taraborrelli believed that the \"mere fact that at the time of its release so many couldn't resist commenting on the record was a testament to the continuous, growing fascination with Madonna ... Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment.\"Chris Smith, author of 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music, believed that it was with Like a Virgin that Madonna was able to steal the spotlight towards herself. She asserted her sexuality as only male rock stars had done before, moving well beyond the limited confines of being a pop artist, to becoming a focal point for nationwide discussions of power relationships in the areas of sex, race, gender, religion, and other divisive social topics. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population. Consequence of Sound ranked the album at number two on \"The 10 Greatest Sophomore Albums of All Time,\" calling it the album that \"carved out the throne...that would be Madonna's forever: the Queen of Pop.\"\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks produced by Nile Rodgers, except \"Into the Groove\" produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray.\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nCharts\nCertifications and sales\nSee also\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nChapter II (Ashanti album)\nChapter II is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Ashanti. It was released by Murder Inc. and Island Def Jam on July 1, 2003 in the United States. Ashanti reteamed with Murder Inc. head Irv Gotti and producer Chink Santana to work on the album. Chapter II features a guest appearance by rapper Ja Rule, Chink Santana, and Gunnz. Critical reception towards the album was generally mixed, with critics commending the album's autobiographical lyrics, and its fun yet light nature, while other critics felt Chapter II lacked creativity and personality and relied too heavily on the formula of her debut album (2002).\nUpon its release, the album debut at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 326,000 units. It also reached the top ten in Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Chapter II was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in August 2003 and gained gold status in Japan and the United Kingdom. At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, it earned Ashanti three nominations for Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song. Chapter II spawned three singles, including the Billboard Hot 100 number two song \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\", the R&B ballad \"Rain on Me\" and \"Breakup 2 Makeup (Remix)\".\n\nPromotion\nMurder Inc. selected \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby),\" which they considered a continuation from her debut single \"Foolish\" (2002), to be released as the album's first single from Chapter 2. Issued on May 19, 2003, the song became a commercial success stateside and Ashanti's third solo top ten hit. It peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, while reaching number four on the Billboard Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Internationally, it was a moderate success, reaching the top five in Canada and Japan, the top ten in the United Kingdom, top twenty in Australia, and the top forty in Ireland, New Zealand, and Switzerland.The album's second single \"Rain on Me\", was released on August 11, 2003. It peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Elsewhere, it reached the top twenty in Belgium and the United Kingdom. In 2004, \"Rain on Me\" earned Ashanti a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. In 2004, a remix version of \"Breakup 2 Makeup\" featuring labelmate Black Child was released as a single. It served as the lead single from Ashanti's remix compilation album Collectables by Ashanti, released in 2005, reaching number 76 on the Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs.\n\nCritical reception\nChapter II received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 51, based on 11 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh remarked that Chapter II \"isn't perfect, but once you edit out the skits (which are, without exception, excruciating), you're left with an album that's graceful, beguiling and above all, light, in the best sense of the word.\" People magazine noted that \"the singer's sophomore CD, though, proves wrong those who thought she would be a one-hit-album wonder. Chapter II, which continues the same hip-hop soul theme as her self-titled debut, is the equivalent of a good beach read: It's easy, breezy listening that doesn't require much brainpower.\"Billboard wrote that Chapter II \"doesn't stray too far from its predecessor\" and complimented the autobiographical songs on the album. Ernest Hardy from Rolling Stone found that the \"album is filled with the same beat-driven, slickly produced midtempo tracks and ballads that made up her debut [and] the disc's best moments have a decidedly old-school feel to them [...] Still, dullard schoolgirl insights into love and heartache dominate the album; add some boring between-song skits about 'haters,' and Chapter II wears thin long before its halfway mark.\" While he complimented Ashanti for her writing credits on the album, Entertainment Weekly journalist Tom Sinclair felt that \"Chapter II is too mired in tired R&B conventions to achieve true magnificence.\"Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that \"the songs have about as much personality as Ashanti's voice, but that actually is a point in its favor, since it keeps everything on an even keel and makes Gotti and Santana's stylish production the star. They are the secret ingredients that make Chapter II good romantic mood music for the summer.\" Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine wrote that \"the album's got some great tunes, but they'd be better suited for someone like Mary J. Blige, whom Shany & Co. bite off.\" Robert Christgau gave Chapter II a \"C\" rating in his review for The Village Voice, calling it a \"pathologically modest follow-up.\" PopMatters from Maurice Bottomley assured that \"Chapter 2 is not going to feature as any scribe's R&B album of the year.\"\n\nCommercial performance\nIn the United States, Chapter II debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 326,000 units sold. While it became Ashanti's second chart topper, it was a considerable decline from her previous effort Ashanti, which had opened to sales of 502,500 units in April 2002. In total, it remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 30 consecutive weeks. In addition, it reached the top position on Billboard's Top R&B\/Hip Hop Albums chart, where it stayed at the top spot for two consecutive weeks. On August 14, 2003, The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Towards the end of 2003, Billboard ranked the album at number 54 and 27 respectively on its Billboard 200 and Top R&B\/Hip-Hop Albums year end chart lists. By January 2005, Chapter II had sold 1.5 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.Elsewhere, Chapter II reached the top five on the Canadian and UK Singles Chart.

She was first discovered as a teenager and later signed to Murder Inc. Records in 2002. That year, she was featured on Fat Joe's \"What's Luv?\" and Ja Rule's \"Always on Time\", both of which became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. She became the first female artist to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously with \"Foolish\" and \"What's Luv?\" at numbers one and two, respectively.\nIn 2002, Ashanti released her eponymous debut album, which sold over 505,000 copies throughout the U.S. in its first week of release. The album earned her many awards, including eight Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and a Grammy Award in 2003 for Best Contemporary R&B Album. The album has since been certified triple platinum in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide by the end of 2003. The lead single for the album, \"Foolish\", was a critical and commercial success; it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. With \"Foolish\", she became the second artist (after The Beatles) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti wrote and provided background vocals for Jennifer Lopez's \"Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)\", which also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.In 2003, Ashanti released her second album, Chapter II, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S. The album went platinum, selling over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. since its release. The album's singles, \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\" and \"Rain on Me\", were both commercial successes, peaking at number two and number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, respectively. Chapter II was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, and \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\" and \"Rain on Me\" were each nominated in the categories of Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. In November 2003, Ashanti released a Christmas album titled Ashanti's Christmas, which was a modest commercial success.\nIn 2004, Ashanti released her third studio album, Concrete Rose, the title of which took on Tupac Shakur's pseudonym \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\". The album debuted at number seven in the U.S., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and became her third platinum-certified album. The first single, \"Only U\", reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad \"Don't Let Them\", garnered little chart success after Def Jam refused to fund a music video due to Irv Gotti's legal troubles during his money laundering trial. Her subsequent albums include The Declaration (2008) and Braveheart (2014), the latter of which was released independently, on Ashanti's record label, Written Entertainment.\nAside from music, Ashanti has also acted in various productions. In 2005, she made her feature film debut in Coach Carter alongside Samuel L. Jackson.

She has since appeared in the films John Tucker Must Die (2006) and Resident Evil: Extinction (2007). Throughout her career, Ashanti has sold nearly 15 million records worldwide.\n\nEarly life\nAshanti Douglas was born on October 13, 1980 in Glen Cove, New York. Her mother, Tina Douglas, is African-American and a former dance teacher, her father, Ken-Kaide Thomas Douglas, is also African-American and a former singer. She is the oldest of her parents' children, with a younger sister named Kenashia \"Shia\" Douglas. Ashanti's mother named her after the Ashanti Empire in Ghana; in this nation, women had power and influence, and Tina wanted Ashanti to follow that model. Her grandfather, James, was a civil rights activist who was associated with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s.Ashanti's mother discovered her full singing potential when she overheard Ashanti singing Mary J. Blige's \"Reminisce\" at age 12 (after the song was released on Ashanti's birthday). While attending high school, she began to write songs. As a teenager, she performed in a local talent show and at several small festivals. She got her first taste of acting as a child extra in Spike Lee's Malcolm X (1992) and in Ted Demme's Who's the Man?. She also had a couple of minor appearances in music videos, such as KRS-One's \"MC's Act Like They Don't Know\" as well as 8-Off's \"Ghetto Girl\".Ashanti struggled to find success as a singer after being courted by several record labels, including Bad Boy and Jive. Despite this, she continued to perform in and around New York and began hanging out at the Murder Inc. recording studio, hoping for a big break.\n\nCareer\n2001\u20132003: Ashanti, Chapter II and Ashanti's Christmas\nAshanti was first noticed by Irv Gotti because of her vocal skills. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun's song \"How We Roll\". In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah's singles \"Pov City Anthem\" and \"Just Like a Thug\". She also appeared on the 2001 The Fast and the Furious soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita's 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna's \"Justify My Love\" and on the solo track \"When a Man Does Wrong\". She was then featured on Fat Joe's \"What's Luv?\" and Ja Rule's \"Always on Time\". \"What's Luv?\" and \"Always on Time\" were released simultaneously and became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously when \"Always on Time\" and \"What's Luv?\" were at numbers one and two, respectively.\nFollowing the success of her collaborations with Ja Rule and Fat Joe, Ashanti released her debut single, \"Foolish\", which contains a sample of the 1983 song \"Stay with Me\" by DeBarge (also used by The Notorious B.I.G. in his 1995 single \"One More Chance\", and by Big L in \"MVP\"). This is her biggest success to date, spending ten weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. She became the second artist (after The Beatles) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti's self-titled debut album, Ashanti, was released on Irv Gotti's Murder Inc. record label in April 2002. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. The album has been certified triple platinum in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide. Ashanti wrote the album's twelve tracks, most of which were written on the spot in the studio. Ashanti's follow-up singles, \"Happy\" and \"Baby\", were not as successful as her debut single but peaked inside the top ten and top twenty in the U.S., respectively. Ashanti's debut album earned her many awards, including eight Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and a Grammy Award in 2003 for Best Contemporary R&B Album. Ashanti was the first artist to win Best Contemporary R&B Album before the category was last awarded in 2011. She was nominated as Best New Artist and \"Foolish\" was nominated in the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance category. She also received a Comet Award and two Soul Train Music Awards that same year.\nAshanti became the subject of controversy when it was announced that she would receive the Soul Train Aretha Franklin Award for \"Entertainer of the Year\", a high school student took offense and started an online petition against her, explaining to The Seattle Times that she was too new to deserve the award. Nearly 30,000 people agreed with him, signing the petition. Many said that established artists such as Mary J. Blige and Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott or critically acclaimed singers like Alicia Keys and India.Arie were more deserving of an award that carries the name of a musical legend. Despite the petition, the Soul Train committee and Don Cornelius stuck by their decision. Ashanti was applauded by her musical peers as she entered the Pasadena Civic Auditorium to accept her award and she was supported onstage by Patti LaBelle, who stated \"she's a baby and we have to support our babies.\"Just before the release of her second album, Ashanti headlined VH1 Divas Duets alongside Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lisa Marie Presley. During the concert, she performed duets with the Isley Brothers and Stevie Wonder, and participated in the all-star finale performance of Wonder's \"Higher Ground.\"In July 2003, Ashanti released her second album, Chapter II, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S. The album went platinum, selling over 1.5  a million copies in the U.S. Chapter II's first single, \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\", became a hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Its video, which showed Ashanti in a bikini frolicking on a beach and riding an elephant, was nominated for two 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. A remix of the song contains interpolations of Michael Jackson's \"Rock with You\". The second single, \"Rain on Me\", reached the number seven spot on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot 100 R&B Songs chart. Chapter II was nominated for a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, and \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\" and \"Rain on Me\" were nominated in the categories of Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, respectively. In the \"Rain on Me,\" mini-movie music video\u2014directed by Hype Williams and co-starring Larenz Tate\u2014Ashanti portrays a troubled young woman in an abusive relationship. She received a Lifetime Channel Achievement Award for her message speaking out against domestic violence. That same year, she began dating rapper Nelly.In November 2003, Ashanti released a Christmas album titled Ashanti's Christmas. It contained 10 Christmas songs and was a modest commercial success and sold just around 100,000 units in the U.S. The album peaked at No. 160 in the Billboard charts.\n\n2004\u20132007: Concrete Rose, Collectibles by Ashanti and acting\nBefore Concrete Rose was released, Ashanti did some major promotion for her single \"Only U\", when she premiered it at the 2004 Vibe Music Awards. She featured on \"Wonderful\"\u2014with Ja Rule and R. Kelly\u2014that year, which peaked at number five in the U.S. and at number one in the UK. In December 2004, Ashanti released her third studio album, Concrete Rose, the title of which took on Tupac Shakur's pseudonym \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\". The album debuted at number seven in the U.S., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and eventually became her third platinum-certified album. The first single, \"Only U\", reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad \"Don't Let Them\", garnered little chart success after Def Jam refused to fund a music video due to Irv Gotti's legal troubles during his money laundering trial. The single was released only in the U.S., where it failed to chart, and the UK, where it reached the lower end of the top forty. After the release of Concrete Rose, Ashanti released the DVD Ashanti: The Making of a Star, which was available only for a limited time. The deluxe DVD includes an exclusive photo and video shoot footage, music from the albums Ashanti, Chapter II and Concrete Rose, special concert footage, unreleased childhood school performances, and behind-the-scenes interviews with family, friends, and fans.\nIn 2005, Ashanti focused more on her acting career, making her feature film acting debut in the film Coach Carter alongside Samuel L. Jackson, as well as starring as Dorothy Gale in the made-for-television film The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, which pulled in nearly 8 million viewers when it premiered. She sang \"When I'm with You\" for the film which was nominated for a Primetime Emmy in the Outstanding Music and Lyrics category. In Coach Carter, she played a pregnant teenager named Kyra who has to decide whether or not to abort her unborn child. The movie opened at number-one at the U.S. box office, eventually grossing $67  million domestically. Later in 2005, Ashanti was invited to Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball, which honored some of the most influential and legendary African American women of the twentieth century in the fields of art, entertainment, and civil rights. In December 2005, Ashanti released a remix album of Concrete Rose titled Collectables by Ashanti. The album was an opportunity for her to fulfill her contract with Def Jam (and have the option of working with another label). It did not fare well on the charts.\nIn 2006, she starred in the teen comedy John Tucker Must Die, which opened and peaked at number three at the U.S. box office (competing with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Miami Vice) and grossed $68,818,076 worldwide. In 2007, she played a supporting role in the action film Resident Evil: Extinction (2007).\n\n2008\u20132010: The Declaration, departure from The Inc. and The Wiz\nHer fourth studio album, The Declaration, was released on June 3, 2008,  and sold 86,000 units its first week of release, which were the lowest first-week sales for any of Ashanti's studio albums. In mid-2007, MTV News reported that the first single from The Declaration was \"Switch\", which was produced by Shy Carter and released digitally in the United States on July 24, 2007. It was later reported that \"Switch\" may not be included on the album's track listing, and that the first single would be \"Hey Baby (After the Club)\" it was released to radio and digital outlets on October 16. The song, which does not appear on the U.S. editions of the album, peaked at number eighty-seven on the Billboard Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"The Way That I Love You\", was released to radio and digital outlets in January 2008, and was referred to as the \"first single\" in press material and media reports. It reached number two on the Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number thirty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ashanti's first song to reach the top forty since \"Only U\" in 2004. \"Body On Me\" was recorded not only for Ashanti's The Declaration, but also for Nelly's fifth studio album Brass Knuckles. The track is produced by Akon and Giorgio Tuinfort. It went to number one on Billboard's Hot Videoclip Tracks chart in its first week, becoming the first number-one single from Nelly's album.\"Good Good\" was released to urban radio stations on July 16, 2008. The song contains elements of Elton John's 1974 single \"Bennie and the Jets\", and has the same melody arrangement as Michael Jackson's \"The Girl Is Mine\". In July 2008, Ashanti was named an ambassador of tourism for Nassau County, Long Island.\nIn May 2009, Irv Gotti announced that he was officially releasing Ashanti from The Inc. Records, stating that \"The relationship has run its course. The chemistry of what's needed \u2014 we're in two totally different places. You're talking to somebody that took her and shaped and molded her and put her out there for the world, and it blew up. We [hold the record] for the [fastest] selling debut by a female R&B artist \u2014 503 [thousand]. We did it! My views and philosophies and her views and philosophies are not meeting up.\" Gotti also admitted that he and Ashanti have not spoken to each other in a long time. A representative for Ashanti did not respond. On September 24, 2009, Ashanti announced her fifth studio album would be released from her new label, Written Entertainment.\nAshanti headlined the cast of The Wiz in the New York City Center Encores! Summer Stars staging from June 12 to July 5, 2009. Ashanti's role as Dorothy has since received mixed reviews from critics as most praised her vocals but was less pleased with her acting ability. BET and Entertainment Weekly both praised the singer's performance as The New York Post and New York Times gave lukewarm reviews. Though the first night was sold out, some of the other shows were unable to follow its success. On October 27, 2008, Ashanti took part in The Yellow Brick Road Not Taken, a one night only concert to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Wicked, featuring songs written by Stephen Schwartz, that were cut from the show.\n\n2011\u20132014: Hiatus and Braveheart\nAfter a four-year hiatus, Ashanti released the song \"Never Too Far Away\", which was featured in Morgan Creek's film Dream House starring Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz with Naomi Watts. The lead single from her fifth studio album, \"The Woman You Love\" featuring American rapper Busta Rhymes, was released online on December 15, 2011. Ashanti teamed up with Meek Mill and French Montana for the second single \"No One Greater\", which was produced by 7 Aurelius, Irv Gotti and Chink Santana. In April 2013, she released another single called \"Never Should Have\", which later won \"Best Independent R&B\/Soul Performance\" at the 2013 Soul Train Awards. A music video for the track was also released.In November 2012, it was reported that she had landed her first series regular role in the seventh season of Army Wives, playing Latasha Montclair. The series was canceled on September 24, 2013. In the fall of 2013, she appeared in a guest spot on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit alongside Clay Aiken and Taylor Hicks. She also starred in the Lifetime film Christmas in the City which premiered on December 7, 2013.In August 2013, Ashanti announced her plans to once again work with Ja Rule, who'd been released from prison in July of that year following a six-year sentence stemming from a gun charge. On January 8, 2014, she revealed the official cover art and release date for Braveheart, her fifth album, which was released on March 4, 2014. In January 2014, Ashanti shot the video for the official first single from Braveheart titled \"I Got It\" featuring Rick Ross. The video was shot in Miami, Florida, and was directed by Eif Rivera. In July, Ashanti announced that the second official single from BraveHeart would be \"Early in the Morning\" featuring French Montana. Upon release, the album garnered favorable reviews, with music critics describing Braveheart's sound as an \"evolution of R&B\" and praising the themes of empowerment but criticizing the romantic clich\u00e9s and lack of interesting moments on the album. On the charts, Braveheart opened at number ten in the U.S. Billboard 200, becoming Ashanti's fifth consecutive top-ten album, as well as her first Independent Albums chart-topper. It also debuted in the top thirty of the UK R&B Albums Chart and top-forty of the UK Indie Albums Chart.\n\n2015\u2013present: Current activities and upcoming seventh studio album\nIn 2015, she announced that she had worked on new music for her seventh album, with an unknown release date. Ashanti collaborated with Michelle Obama for her #Let'sMove campaign to spread awareness of drinking water with her new video and song \"Let's Go\" released in 2015. In 2016, she collaborated on the song \"Seven Day Love\" included in the album \"Inzombia\" by Canadian singer Belly. She has also worked with numerous artists, including Sia, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Queen Latifah, Usher and Kelly Clarkson to interpret the songs of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" for the compilation \"The Hamilton Mixtape\".In 2017, Ashanti announced her seventh studio album, revealing it would be released in 2018. She denied this in June 2018, confirming the future release of an album in collaboration with rapper Ja Rule. Between 2017 and 2018 she returned to the music scene with several collaborations including the single \"Say Less\" with Ty Dolla Sign, the track \"The Road\" by Machel Montano, and the song \"Start This Shit Off Right\" with Mack Maine, from the album \"Tha Carter V\" by Lil Wayne.Ashanti released the collaboration \"Pretty Little Thing\" with Afro B in August 2019. She also featured on the soundtrack of the film Stuck, which she produced. In November, Ashanti guest-starred as herself in two episodes of the third season of The CW's Dynasty reboot: \"Mother, I'm At La Mirage\" and \"Something Desperate\".In January 2021, Ashanti released her single \"2:35 (I Want You)\".On March 10, 2022, Ashanti's single \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\" was heavily sampled for British rapper Aitch's single \"Baby\".In October 2022, Ashanti was featured on Diddy\u2019s \u201cGotta Move On\u201d remix which also features Bryson Tiller and Yung Miami.\n\nArtistry\nAshanti has a lyric soprano voice type. Critics have referred to her voice as \"pretty\" and her soprano as \"sultry\" and \"sweet but slight\". Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic noted her reputation for using her \"swooning voice\" in duets with Big Pun, Fat Joe, and Ja Rule. As a young girl, Ashanti was influenced by Ella Fitzgerald, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Tupac Shakur, but she cites Mary J. Blige as the main reason she wanted to pursue a singing career. Further musical influences include Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Smokey Robinson, Donna Summer, and Blue Magic.\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn 2003, Ashanti partnered with LidRock and the San Francisco-based Family Violence Prevention Fund (FVPF) to raise awareness about the issue of domestic violence during National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and to distribute the \"Rain on Me\" mini-movie using LidRock's unique platform. Proceeds from the $5 mini-disc went towards helping to stop domestic violence. Ashanti also recorded a public service announcement that appeared in more than 4,000 film screens and reached millions of people. Ashanti also gives back by raising money for sickle cell research and she is active in helping the Make-A-Wish Foundation stating, \"I'll go and do just about anything for them.\" In 2005, Ashanti helped by recording public service announcement and raising money for the Southeast Asia tsunami disaster. Later that year, she helped raise money for the Hurricane Katrina victims and storm evacuees.In 2008, Ashanti, along with others celebrities, taped a PSA to help stop violence and discrimination towards the LGBT community in response to the death of Lawrence King, an eighth-grader at E.O. Green Junior High School, who was shot because of his sexual orientation and gender expression. That same year, she launched a special on-line campaign called \"I Declare Me...\" with Wal-Mart. The campaign's core is a very personal focus on the self-definition and empowerment of women across the United States, with its home base at Ashanti's official website. The campaign creates a safe and inclusive on-line space to for women to share testimonies on the site. Participants are able to openly declare their own breakthroughs, revelations, struggles and victories in every life area they choose: career, birth, death, relationships, and personal situations. \"I Declare Me...\" also invites women to a virtual discussion with Ashanti on such issues as voter registration, teen obesity, and other concerns facing women today.\nIn September 2009, Ashanti, along with other artists such as Mariah Carey, Beyonc\u00e9, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Fergie, Sheryl Crow, Miley Cyrus, Melissa Etheridge, Natasha Bedingfield, Keyshia Cole, Ciara, Leona Lewis, LeAnn Rimes and Carrie Underwood, teamed up for the song \"Just Stand Up!\". The charity tune for cancer was conceived by Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, who produced it with longtime creative colleague Babyface. All 15 singers (along with Nicole Scherzinger) shared the stage to perform the song live on September 5, 2008, during the \"Stand Up to Cancer\" television special, which aired simultaneously on ABC, NBC and CBS, and helped raise $100 million for cancer research. As a result of SU2C fund raising endeavors, the SU2C scientific advisory committee, overseen by the American Association for Cancer Research, was able to award 73.6 million dollars towards novel, groundbreaking cancer research in 2009.In November 2009, Ashanti joined the crew of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. In the episode, which aired on January 24, 2010, the singer assisted in the rebuilding of the Powell Family home in Buffalo, New York.  The efforts from the show expanded significantly to include not just the family home but the entire neighborhood surrounding it. In 2013, Ashanti featured on the 19-track compilation album Songs for a Healthier America, a collaborative project by the Partnership for a Healthier America, whose honorary chair is Michelle Obama, and Hip Hop Public Health. Her song \"Just Believe\" also featured Artie Green, Gerry Gunn, Robbie Nova and Chauncey Hawkins. Additionally, she is affiliated with the Jumpstart reading program, the Tupperware Brand and the Boys and Girls Club of America.\n\nPersonal life\nOn January 1, 2003, Ashanti met rapper Nelly at a press conference for the 2003 Grammy Awards, and the two later began dating. They ended their relationship after a decade together. In 2023, they reunited and got back together.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albumsAshanti (2002)\nChapter II (2003)\nAshanti's Christmas (2003)\nConcrete Rose (2004)\nThe Declaration (2008)\nBraveheart (2014)\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nTheater\nSee also\nList of awards and nominations received by Ashanti","label":"longbench","length":16175,"title":"Passage 1:"}
{"context":"Introduction\nEvent detection on microblogging platforms such as Twitter aims to detect events preemptively. A main task in event detection is detecting events of predetermined types BIBREF0, such as concerts or controversial events based on microposts matching specific event descriptions. This task has extensive applications ranging from cyber security BIBREF1, BIBREF2 to political elections BIBREF3 or public health BIBREF4, BIBREF5. Due to the high ambiguity and inconsistency of the terms used in microposts, event detection is generally performed though statistical machine learning models, which require a labeled dataset for model training. Data labeling is, however, a long, laborious, and usually costly process. For the case of micropost classification, though positive labels can be collected (e.g., using specific hashtags, or event-related date-time information), there is no straightforward way to generate negative labels useful for model training. To tackle this lack of negative labels and the significant manual efforts in data labeling, BIBREF1 (BIBREF1, BIBREF3) introduced a weak supervision based learning approach, which uses only positively labeled data, accompanied by unlabeled examples by filtering microposts that contain a certain keyword indicative of the event type under consideration (e.g., `hack' for cyber security). Another key technique in this context is expectation regularization BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF1. Here, the estimated proportion of relevant microposts in an unlabeled dataset containing a keyword is given as a keyword-specific expectation. This expectation is used in the regularization term of the model's objective function to constrain the posterior distribution of the model predictions. By doing so, the model is trained with an expectation on its prediction for microposts that contain the keyword. Such a method, however, suffers from two key problems:\nDue to the unpredictability of event occurrences and the constantly changing dynamics of users' posting frequency BIBREF8, estimating the expectation associated with a keyword is a challenging task, even for domain experts;\nThe performance of the event detection model is constrained by the informativeness of the keyword used for model training. As of now, we lack a principled method for discovering new keywords and improve the model performance.\nTo address the above issues, we advocate a human-AI loop approach for discovering informative keywords and estimating their expectations reliably. Our approach iteratively leverages 1) crowd workers for estimating keyword-specific expectations, and 2) the disagreement between the model and the crowd for discovering new informative keywords. More specifically, at each iteration after we obtain a keyword-specific expectation from the crowd, we train the model using expectation regularization and select those keyword-related microposts for which the model's prediction disagrees the most with the crowd's expectation; such microposts are then presented to the crowd to identify new keywords that best explain the disagreement. By doing so, our approach identifies new keywords which convey more relevant information with respect to existing ones, thus effectively boosting model performance. By exploiting the disagreement between the model and the crowd, our approach can make efficient use of the crowd, which is of critical importance in a human-in-the-loop context BIBREF9, BIBREF10. An additional advantage of our approach is that by obtaining new keywords that improve model performance over time, we are able to gain insight into how the model learns for specific event detection tasks. Such an advantage is particularly useful for event detection using complex models, e.g., deep neural networks, which are intrinsically hard to understand BIBREF11, BIBREF12. An additional challenge in involving crowd workers is that their contributions are not fully reliable BIBREF13. In the crowdsourcing literature, this problem is usually tackled with probabilistic latent variable models BIBREF14, BIBREF15, BIBREF16, which are used to perform truth inference by aggregating a redundant set of crowd contributions. Our human-AI loop approach improves the inference of keyword expectation by aggregating contributions not only from the crowd but also from the model. This, however, comes with its own challenge as the model's predictions are further dependent on the results of expectation inference, which is used for model training. To address this problem, we introduce a unified probabilistic model that seamlessly integrates expectation inference and model training, thereby allowing the former to benefit from the latter while resolving the inter-dependency between the two.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a human-AI loop approach that iteratively improves machine learning models for event detection. In summary, our work makes the following key contributions:\nA novel human-AI loop approach for micropost event detection that jointly discovers informative keywords and estimates their expectation;\nA unified probabilistic model that infers keyword expectation and simultaneously performs model training;\nAn extensive empirical evaluation of our approach on multiple real-world datasets demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the state of the art by an average of 24.3% AUC.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, we present our human-AI loop approach in Section SECREF2. Subsequently, we introduce our proposed probabilistic model in Section SECREF3. The experimental setup and results are presented in Section SECREF4. Finally, we briefly cover related work in Section SECREF5 before concluding our work in Section SECREF6.\nThe Human-AI Loop Approach\nGiven a set of labeled and unlabeled microposts, our goal is to extract informative keywords and estimate their expectations in order to train a machine learning model. To achieve this goal, our proposed human-AI loop approach comprises two crowdsourcing tasks, i.e., micropost classification followed by keyword discovery, and a unified probabilistic model for expectation inference and model training. Figure FIGREF6 presents an overview of our approach. Next, we describe our approach from a process-centric perspective.\nFollowing previous studies BIBREF1, BIBREF17, BIBREF2, we collect a set of unlabeled microposts $\\mathcal {U}$ from a microblogging platform and post-filter, using an initial (set of) keyword(s), those microposts that are potentially relevant to an event category. Then, we collect a set of event-related microposts (i.e., positively labeled microposts) $\\mathcal {L}$, post-filtering with a list of seed events. $\\mathcal {U}$ and $\\mathcal {L}$ are used together to train a discriminative model (e.g., a deep neural network) for classifying the relevance of microposts to an event. We denote the target model as $p_\\theta (y|x)$, where $\\theta $ is the model parameter to be learned and $y$ is the label of an arbitrary micropost, represented by a bag-of-words vector $x$. Our approach iterates several times $t=\\lbrace 1, 2, \\ldots \\rbrace $ until the performance of the target model converges. Each iteration starts from the initial keyword(s) or the new keyword(s) discovered in the previous iteration. Given such a keyword, denoted by $w^{(t)}$, the iteration starts by sampling microposts containing the keyword from $\\mathcal {U}$, followed by dynamically creating micropost classification tasks and publishing them on a crowdsourcing platform.\nMicropost Classification. The micropost classification task requires crowd workers to label the selected microposts into two classes: event-related and non event-related. In particular, workers are given instructions and examples to differentiate event-instance related microposts and general event-category related microposts. Consider, for example, the following microposts in the context of Cyber attack events, both containing the keyword `hack':\nCredit firm Equifax says 143m Americans' social security numbers exposed in hack\nThis micropost describes an instance of a cyber attack event that the target model should identify. This is, therefore, an event-instance related micropost and should be considered as a positive example. Contrast this with the following example:\nCompanies need to step their cyber security up\nThis micropost, though related to cyber security in general, does not mention an instance of a cyber attack event, and is of no interest to us for event detection. This is an example of a general event-category related micropost and should be considered as a negative example.\nIn this task, each selected micropost is labeled by multiple crowd workers. The annotations are passed to our probabilistic model for expectation inference and model training.\nExpectation Inference & Model Training. Our probabilistic model takes crowd-contributed labels and the model trained in the previous iteration as input. As output, it generates a keyword-specific expectation, denoted as $e^{(t)}$, and an improved version of the micropost classification model, denoted as $p_{\\theta ^{(t)}}(y|x)$. The details of our probabilistic model are given in Section SECREF3.\nKeyword Discovery. The keyword discovery task aims at discovering a new keyword (or a set of keywords) that is most informative for model training with respect to existing keywords. To this end, we first apply the current model $p_{\\theta ^{(t)}}(y|x)$ on the unlabeled microposts $\\mathcal {U}$. For those that contain the keyword $w^{(t)}$, we calculate the disagreement between the model predictions and the keyword-specific expectation $e^{(t)}$:\nand select the ones with the highest disagreement for keyword discovery. These selected microposts are supposed to contain information that can explain the disagreement between the model prediction and keyword-specific expectation, and can thus provide information that is most different from the existing set of keywords for model training.\nFor instance, our study shows that the expectation for the keyword `hack' is 0.20, which means only 20% of the initial set of microposts retrieved with the keyword are event-related. A micropost selected with the highest disagreement (Eq. DISPLAY_FORM7), whose likelihood of being event-related as predicted by the model is $99.9\\%$, is shown as an example below:\nRT @xxx: Hong Kong securities brokers hit by cyber attacks, may face more: regulator #cyber #security #hacking https:\/\/t.co\/rC1s9CB\nThis micropost contains keywords that can better indicate the relevance to a cyber security event than the initial keyword `hack', e.g., `securities', `hit', and `attack'.\nNote that when the keyword-specific expectation $e^{(t)}$ in Equation DISPLAY_FORM7 is high, the selected microposts will be the ones that contain keywords indicating the irrelevance of the microposts to an event category. Such keywords are also useful for model training as they help improve the model's ability to identify irrelevant microposts.\nTo identify new keywords in the selected microposts, we again leverage crowdsourcing, as humans are typically better than machines at providing specific explanations BIBREF18, BIBREF19. In the crowdsourcing task, workers are first asked to find those microposts where the model predictions are deemed correct. Then, from those microposts, workers are asked to find the keyword that best indicates the class of the microposts as predicted by the model. The keyword most frequently identified by the workers is then used as the initial keyword for the following iteration. In case multiple keywords are selected, e.g., the top-$N$ frequent ones, workers will be asked to perform $N$ micropost classification tasks for each keyword in the next iteration, and the model training will be performed on multiple keyword-specific expectations.\nUnified Probabilistic Model\nThis section introduces our probabilistic model that infers keyword expectation and trains the target model simultaneously. We start by formalizing the problem and introducing our model, before describing the model learning method.\nProblem Formalization. We consider the problem at iteration $t$ where the corresponding keyword is $w^{(t)}$. In the current iteration, let $\\mathcal {U}^{(t)} \\subset \\mathcal {U}$ denote the set of all microposts containing the keyword and $\\mathcal {M}^{(t)}= \\lbrace x_{m}\\rbrace _{m=1}^M\\subset \\mathcal {U}^{(t)}$ be the randomly selected subset of $M$ microposts labeled by $N$ crowd workers $\\mathcal {C} = \\lbrace c_n\\rbrace _{n=1}^N$. The annotations form a matrix $\\mathbf {A}\\in \\mathbb {R}^{M\\times N}$ where $\\mathbf {A}_{mn}$ is the label for the micropost $x_m$ contributed by crowd worker $c_n$. Our goal is to infer the keyword-specific expectation $e^{(t)}$ and train the target model by learning the model parameter $\\theta ^{(t)}$. An additional parameter of our probabilistic model is the reliability of crowd workers, which is essential when involving crowdsourcing. Following Dawid and Skene BIBREF14, BIBREF16, we represent the annotation reliability of worker $c_n$ by a latent confusion matrix $\\pi ^{(n)}$, where the $rs$-th element $\\pi _{rs}^{(n)}$ denotes the probability of $c_n$ labeling a micropost as class $r$ given the true class $s$.\nUnified Probabilistic Model ::: Expectation as Model Posterior\nFirst, we introduce an expectation regularization technique for the weakly supervised learning of the target model $p_{\\theta ^{(t)}}(y|x)$. In this setting, the objective function of the target model is composed of two parts, corresponding to the labeled microposts $\\mathcal {L}$ and the unlabeled ones $\\mathcal {U}$.\nThe former part aims at maximizing the likelihood of the labeled microposts:\nwhere we assume that $\\theta $ is generated from a prior distribution (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) parameterized by $\\sigma $.\nTo leverage unlabeled data for model training, we make use of the expectations of existing keywords, i.e., {($w^{(1)}$, $e^{(1)}$), ..., ($w^{(t-1)}$, $e^{(t-1)}$), ($w^{(t)}$, $e^{(t)}$)} (Note that $e^{(t)}$ is inferred), as a regularization term to constrain model training. To do so, we first give the model's expectation for each keyword $w^{(k)}$ ($1\\le k\\le t$) as follows:\nwhich denotes the empirical expectation of the model\u2019s posterior predictions on the unlabeled microposts $\\mathcal {U}^{(k)}$ containing keyword $w^{(k)}$. Expectation regularization can then be formulated as the regularization of the distance between the Bernoulli distribution parameterized by the model's expectation and the expectation of the existing keyword:\nwhere $D_{KL}[\\cdot \\Vert \\cdot ]$ denotes the KL-divergence between the Bernoulli distributions $Ber(e^{(k)})$ and $Ber(\\mathbb {E}_{x\\sim \\mathcal {U}^{(k)}}(y))$, and $\\lambda $ controls the strength of expectation regularization.\nUnified Probabilistic Model ::: Expectation as Class Prior\nTo learn the keyword-specific expectation $e^{(t)}$ and the crowd worker reliability $\\pi ^{(n)}$ ($1\\le n\\le N$), we model the likelihood of the crowd-contributed labels $\\mathbf {A}$ as a function of these parameters. In this context, we view the expectation as the class prior, thus performing expectation inference as the learning of the class prior. By doing so, we connect expectation inference with model training.\nSpecifically, we model the likelihood of an arbitrary crowd-contributed label $\\mathbf {A}_{mn}$ as a mixture of multinomials where the prior is the keyword-specific expectation $e^{(t)}$:\nwhere $e_s^{(t)}$ is the probability of the ground truth label being $s$ given the keyword-specific expectation as the class prior; $K$ is the set of possible ground truth labels (binary in our context); and $r=\\mathbf {A}_{mn}$ is the crowd-contributed label. Then, for an individual micropost $x_m$, the likelihood of crowd-contributed labels $\\mathbf {A}_{m:}$ is given by:\nTherefore, the objective function for maximizing the likelihood of the entire annotation matrix $\\mathbf {A}$ can be described as:\nUnified Probabilistic Model ::: Unified Probabilistic Model\nIntegrating model training with expectation inference, the overall objective function of our proposed model is given by:\nFigure FIGREF18 depicts a graphical representation of our model, which combines the target model for training (on the left) with the generative model for crowd-contributed labels (on the right) through a keyword-specific expectation.\nModel Learning. Due to the unknown ground truth labels of crowd-annotated microposts ($y_m$ in Figure FIGREF18), we resort to expectation maximization for model learning. The learning algorithm iteratively takes two steps: the E-step and the M-step. The E-step infers the ground truth labels given the current model parameters. The M-step updates the model parameters, including the crowd reliability parameters $\\pi ^{(n)}$ ($1\\le n\\le N$), the keyword-specific expectation $e^{(t)}$, and the parameter of the target model $\\theta ^{(t)}$. The E-step and the crowd parameter update in the M-step are similar to the Dawid-Skene model BIBREF14. The keyword expectation is inferred by taking into account both the crowd-contributed labels and the model prediction:\nThe parameter of the target model is updated by gradient descent. For example, when the target model to be trained is a deep neural network, we use back-propagation with gradient descent to update the weight matrices.\nExperiments and Results\nThis section presents our experimental setup and results for evaluating our approach. We aim at answering the following questions:\n[noitemsep,leftmargin=*]\nQ1: How effectively does our proposed human-AI loop approach enhance the state-of-the-art machine learning models for event detection?\nQ2: How well does our keyword discovery method work compare to existing keyword expansion methods?\nQ3: How effective is our approach using crowdsourcing at obtaining new keywords compared with an approach labelling microposts for model training under the same cost?\nQ4: How much benefit does our unified probabilistic model bring compared to methods that do not take crowd reliability into account?\nExperiments and Results ::: Experimental Setup\nDatasets. We perform our experiments with two predetermined event categories: cyber security (CyberAttack) and death of politicians (PoliticianDeath). These event categories are chosen as they are representative of important event types that are of interest to many governments and companies. The need to create our own dataset was motivated by the lack of public datasets for event detection on microposts. The few available datasets do not suit our requirements. For example, the publicly available Events-2012 Twitter dataset BIBREF20 contains generic event descriptions such as Politics, Sports, Culture etc. Our work targets more specific event categories BIBREF21. Following previous studies BIBREF1, we collect event-related microposts from Twitter using 11 and 8 seed events (see Section SECREF2) for CyberAttack and PoliticianDeath, respectively. Unlabeled microposts are collected by using the keyword `hack' for CyberAttack, while for PoliticianDeath, we use a set of keywords related to `politician' and `death' (such as `bureaucrat', `dead' etc.) For each dataset, we randomly select 500 tweets from the unlabeled subset and manually label them for evaluation. Table TABREF25 shows key statistics from our two datasets.\nComparison Methods. To demonstrate the generality of our approach on different event detection models, we consider Logistic Regression (LR) BIBREF1 and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) BIBREF2 as the target models. As the goal of our experiments is to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach as a new model training technique, we use these widely used models. Also, we note that in our case other neural network models with more complex network architectures for event detection, such as the bi-directional LSTM BIBREF17, turn out to be less effective than a simple feedforward network. For both LR and MLP, we evaluate our proposed human-AI loop approach for keyword discovery and expectation estimation by comparing against the weakly supervised learning method proposed by BIBREF1 (BIBREF1) and BIBREF17 (BIBREF17) where only one initial keyword is used with an expectation estimated by an individual expert.\nParameter Settings. We empirically set optimal parameters based on a held-out validation set that contains 20% of the test data. These include the hyperparamters of the target model, those of our proposed probabilistic model, and the parameters used for training the target model. We explore MLP with 1, 2 and 3 hidden layers and apply a grid search in 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 for the dimension of the embeddings and that of the hidden layers. For the coefficient of expectation regularization, we follow BIBREF6 (BIBREF6) and set it to $\\lambda =10 \\times $ #labeled examples. For model training, we use the Adam BIBREF22 optimization algorithm for both models.\nEvaluation. Following BIBREF1 (BIBREF1) and BIBREF3 (BIBREF3), we use accuracy and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC) metrics to measure the performance of our proposed approach. We note that due to the imbalance in our datasets (20% positive microposts in CyberAttack and 27% in PoliticianDeath), accuracy is dominated by negative examples; AUC, in comparison, better characterizes the discriminative power of the model.\nCrowdsourcing. We chose Level 3 workers on the Figure-Eight crowdsourcing platform for our experiments. The inter-annotator agreement in micropost classification is taken into account through the EM algorithm. For keyword discovery, we filter keywords based on the frequency of the keyword being selected by the crowd. In terms of cost-effectiveness, our approach is motivated from the fact that crowdsourced data annotation can be expensive, and is thus designed with minimal crowd involvement. For each iteration, we selected 50 tweets for keyword discovery and 50 tweets for micropost classification per keyword. For a dataset with 80k tweets (e.g., CyberAttack), our approach only requires to manually inspect 800 tweets (for 8 keywords), which is only 1% of the entire dataset.\nExperiments and Results ::: Results of our Human-AI Loop (Q1)\nTable TABREF26 reports the evaluation of our approach on both the CyberAttack and PoliticianDeath event categories. Our approach is configured such that each iteration starts with 1 new keyword discovered in the previous iteration.\nOur approach improves LR by 5.17% (Accuracy) and 18.38% (AUC), and MLP by 10.71% (Accuracy) and 30.27% (AUC) on average. Such significant improvements clearly demonstrate that our approach is effective at improving model performance. We observe that the target models generally converge between the 7th and 9th iteration on both datasets when performance is measured by AUC. The performance can slightly degrade when the models are further trained for more iterations on both datasets. This is likely due to the fact that over time, the newly discovered keywords entail lower novel information for model training. For instance, for the CyberAttack dataset the new keyword in the 9th iteration `election' frequently co-occurs with the keyword `russia' in the 5th iteration (in microposts that connect Russian hackers with US elections), thus bringing limited new information for improving the model performance. As a side remark, we note that the models converge faster when performance is measured by accuracy. Such a comparison result confirms the difference between the metrics and shows the necessity for more keywords to discriminate event-related microposts from non event-related ones.\nExperiments and Results ::: Comparative Results on Keyword Discovery (Q2)\nFigure FIGREF31 shows the evaluation of our approach when discovering new informative keywords for model training (see Section SECREF2: Keyword Discovery). We compare our human-AI collaborative way of discovering new keywords against a query expansion (QE) approach BIBREF23, BIBREF24 that leverages word embeddings to find similar words in the latent semantic space. Specifically, we use pre-trained word embeddings based on a large Google News dataset for query expansion. For instance, the top keywords resulting from QE for `politician' are, `deputy',`ministry',`secretary', and `minister'. For each of these keywords, we use the crowd to label a set of tweets and obtain a corresponding expectation.\nWe observe that our approach consistently outperforms QE by an average of $4.62\\%$ and $52.58\\%$ AUC on CyberAttack and PoliticianDeath, respectively. The large gap between the performance improvements for the two datasets is mainly due to the fact that microposts that are relevant for PoliticianDeath are semantically more complex than those for CyberAttack, as they encode noun-verb relationship (e.g., \u201cthe king of ... died ...\u201d) rather than a simple verb (e.g., \u201c... hacked.\u201d) for the CyberAttack microposts. QE only finds synonyms of existing keywords related to either `politician' or `death', however cannot find a meaningful keyword that fully characterizes the death of a politician. For instance, QE finds the keywords `kill' and `murder', which are semantically close to `death' but are not specifically relevant to the death of a politician. Unlike QE, our approach identifies keywords that go beyond mere synonyms and that are more directly related to the end task, i.e., discriminating event-related microposts from non related ones. Examples are `demise' and `condolence'. As a remark, we note that in Figure FIGREF31(b), the increase in QE performance on PoliticianDeath is due to the keywords `deputy' and `minister', which happen to be highly indicative of the death of a politician in our dataset; these keywords are also identified by our approach.\nExperiments and Results ::: Cost-Effectiveness Results (Q3)\nTo demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of using crowdsourcing for obtaining new keywords and consequently, their expectations, we compare the performance of our approach with an approach using crowdsourcing to only label microposts for model training at the same cost. Specifically, we conducted an additional crowdsourcing experiment where the same cost used for keyword discovery in our approach is used to label additional microposts for model training. These newly labeled microposts are used with the microposts labeled in the micropost classification task of our approach (see Section SECREF2: Micropost Classification) and the expectation of the initial keyword to train the model for comparison. The model trained in this way increases AUC by 0.87% for CyberAttack, and by 1.06% for PoliticianDeath; in comparison, our proposed approach increases AUC by 33.42% for PoliticianDeath and by 15.23% for CyberAttack over the baseline presented by BIBREF1). These results show that using crowdsourcing for keyword discovery is significantly more cost-effective than simply using crowdsourcing to get additional labels when training the model.\nExperiments and Results ::: Expectation Inference Results (Q4)\nTo investigate the effectiveness of our expectation inference method, we compare it against a majority voting approach, a strong baseline in truth inference BIBREF16. Figure FIGREF36 shows the result of this evaluation. We observe that our approach results in better models for both CyberAttack and PoliticianDeath. Our manual investigation reveals that workers' annotations are of high reliability, which explains the relatively good performance of majority voting. Despite limited margin for improvement, our method of expectation inference improves the performance of majority voting by $0.4\\%$ and $1.19\\%$ AUC on CyberAttack and PoliticianDeath, respectively.\nRelated Work\nEvent Detection. The techniques for event extraction from microblogging platforms can be classified according to their domain specificity and their detection method BIBREF0. Early works mainly focus on open domain event detection BIBREF25, BIBREF26, BIBREF27. Our work falls into the category of domain-specific event detection BIBREF21, which has drawn increasing attention due to its relevance for various applications such as cyber security BIBREF1, BIBREF2 and public health BIBREF4, BIBREF5. In terms of technique, our proposed detection method is related to the recently proposed weakly supervised learning methods BIBREF1, BIBREF17, BIBREF3. This comes in contrast with fully-supervised learning methods, which are often limited by the size of the training data (e.g., a few hundred examples) BIBREF28, BIBREF29.\nHuman-in-the-Loop Approaches. Our work extends weakly supervised learning methods by involving humans in the loop BIBREF13. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches mainly leverage crowds to label individual data instances BIBREF9, BIBREF10 or to debug the training data BIBREF30, BIBREF31 or components BIBREF32, BIBREF33, BIBREF34 of a machine learning system. Unlike these works, we leverage crowd workers to label sampled microposts in order to obtain keyword-specific expectations, which can then be generalized to help classify microposts containing the same keyword, thus amplifying the utility of the crowd. Our work is further connected to the topic of interpretability and transparency of machine learning models BIBREF11, BIBREF35, BIBREF12, for which humans are increasingly involved, for instance for post-hoc evaluations of the model's interpretability. In contrast, our approach directly solicits informative keywords from the crowd for model training, thereby providing human-understandable explanations for the improved model.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we presented a new human-AI loop approach for keyword discovery and expectation estimation to better train event detection models. Our approach takes advantage of the disagreement between the crowd and the model to discover informative keywords and leverages the joint power of the crowd and the model in expectation inference. We evaluated our approach on real-world datasets and showed that it significantly outperforms the state of the art and that it is particularly useful for detecting events where relevant microposts are semantically complex, e.g., the death of a politician. As future work, we plan to parallelize the crowdsourcing tasks and optimize our pipeline in order to use our event detection approach in real-time.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project has received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant #407540_167320 Tighten-it-All) and from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement 683253\/GraphInt).","label":"longbench","length":6545,"title":"Introduction"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nGuy Gaunt\nAdmiral Sir Guy Reginald Archer Gaunt,  (25 May 1869 \u2013 18 May 1953) was an Australian-born officer of the Royal Navy, counter-intelligence officer and a British Conservative Party politician.\nGaunt was born in Ballarat, Australia, to William Henry Gaunt and his wife Elizabeth Mary Palmer. Gaunt's brother-in-law was Alexander Stenson Palmer (banker and M.P. for Victoria). Gaunt's brother Ernest Gaunt was also an admiral. Their sister, Mary Gaunt, was a well-known author in Australia and wrote several travel books. Guy was educated at Melbourne Grammar School from 1881 to 1883.\n\nNaval career\nGaunt's parents wanted him to become a lawyer, but he chose to go to sea. He began training for the merchant navy, but transferred to the Royal Navy in 1885, one of the \"hungry hundred\" merchant navy officers who were commissioned via the supplementary list.\nGaunt served as a lieutenant on several vessels in the Pacific Ocean, and was promoted to the rank of Commander in 1901. He became a captain in 1907, commanding a series of cruisers and the battleships HMS Majestic and HMS Thunderer. He saw action in the Philippines in 1897 and Samoa in 1901.In 1914 Gaunt was appointed naval attach\u00e9 to the United States, and was instrumental in infiltrating the Hindu\u2013German Conspiracy during the First World War. Gaunt headed the intelligence network operated by Courtenay Bennett's intelligence and liaised with the Czech intelligence network operated by E. V. Voska. On learning of the plot from the Czech European network at the outbreak of the war, Voska passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities. Voska's American network was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats.\nWhen the U.S. entered the war in 1917, Gaunt was appointed as liaison officer. In 1918 he served on convoys across the Atlantic and in June was appointed to the naval intelligence staff at the Admiralty.\nGaunt was promoted on the retired list to rear admiral in October 1918, vice admiral in July 1924 and admiral in February 1928. He was knighted as  in 1918.\n\nPolitical career\nGaunt first stood as a candidate for parliament at the 1918 general election. He was the Liberal candidate for Leek and despite receiving the Coalition Coupon, he was unable to hold the seat. Gaunt was elected as Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for the Buckrose constituency in the East Riding of Yorkshire at the 1922 general election, replacing the Liberal Algernon Moreing.\nGaunt resigned from the House of Commons in 1926, when he was cited as co-respondent in the divorce case between Sir Richard Cruise and his wife.\n\nFamily\nGaunt married a widow, Mrs Margaret Elizabeth Worthington (daughter of Sir Thomas Wardle) at Hong Kong in 1904. \nShe divorced him in 1927 following the scandal with Lady Cruise, and he retired to Tangier. He later remarried on 1 December 1932 a 35-year-old widow, Sybil Victoria Joseph, n\u00e9e Grant White and had two daughters. He returned to live in Cobham, Surrey and died at Woking Hospital on 18 May 1953 and was cremated.Gaunt's autobiography, The Yield of the Years, was published in 1940. His brother Ernest Gaunt was also an admiral in the Royal Navy; his sister, Mary Gaunt, was a novelist.\nPassage 2:\nComprehensive school\nA comprehensive school is a secondary school for pupils aged 11\u201316 or 11\u201318, that does not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, in contrast to a selective school system where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria, usually academic performance. The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where comprehensive schools were introduced as state schools on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965. They may be part of a local education authority or be a self governing academy or part of a multi-academy trust.\n\nAbout 90% of English secondary school pupils attend a comprehensive school (academy schools, community schools, faith schools, foundation schools, free schools, studio schools, university technical colleges, state boarding schools, City Technology Colleges, etc.). Specialist schools may however select up to 10% of their intake for aptitude in their specialism. A school may have a few specialisms, like arts (media, performing arts, visual arts), business and enterprise, engineering, humanities, languages, mathematics, computing, music, science, sports, and technology. They are not permitted to select on academic ability generally. Comprehensive schools correspond broadly to the public school in the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\nEngland\nComprehensive schools provide an entitlement curriculum to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11\u201316 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by sixth form colleges and further education colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude. In addition, government initiatives such as the City Technology Colleges and specialist schools programmes have expanded the comprehensive model. City Technology Colleges are independent schools in urban areas that are free to go to. They're funded by central government with company contributions and emphasise teaching science and technology.\n\nEnglish secondary schools are mostly comprehensive (i.e. no entry exam), although the intake of comprehensive schools can vary widely, especially in urban areas with several local schools. Nearly 90% of state-funded secondary schools are specialist schools, receiving extra funding to develop one or more subjects (performing arts, business, humanities, art and design, languages, science, mathematics, technology, engineering, sports, etc.) in which the school specialises, which can select up to 10% of their intake for aptitude in the specialism. In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 and 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of Key Stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11\u201316 and 11\u201318 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another. In principle, comprehensive schools were conceived as \"neighbourhood\" schools for all students in a specified catchment area.\nMaths free schools like Exeter Mathematics School are for 16 to 19 year pupils who have a great aptitude for maths. As set out in the government's Industrial Strategy, maths schools help to encourage highly skilled graduates in sectors that depend on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) skills. The aim of maths schools is to prepare the most mathematically able pupils to succeed in mathematics-related disciplines at highly selective maths universities and pursue mathematically intensive careers. Maths schools can also be centres of excellence in raising attainment, supporting and influencing the teaching of mathematics in their surrounding area, and are central to their associated universities' widening participation commitments.\n\nTechnical and vocational education in comprehensive schools are introduced during the secondary school years and goes on until further and higher education. Secondary vocational education is also known as further education. Further education incorporates vocational oriented education as well as a combination of general secondary education. Students can also go on to a further education college to prepare themselves for the Business and Technology Education Council, T-levels, and National Vocational Qualifications. Major provider of vocational qualifications in England include the City and Guilds of London Institute and Edexcel. Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas typically require 1 and 2 years of full-time study and credit from either HNE or Diplomas can be transferred toward an undergraduate degree. Along with the HNC and HND, students who are interested in other vocational qualifications may pursue a foundation degree, which is a qualification that trains people to be highly skilled technicians. The National Apprenticeship Service also offers vocational education where people at ages of 16 and older enter apprenticeships in order to learn a skilled trade. There are over 60 different certifications can be obtained through an apprenticeship, which typically lasts from up to 3 years. Trades apprentices receive paid wages during training and spend one day at school and the rest in the workplace to hone their skills.\nThe first comprehensives were set up after the Second World War. At that time the terms \"multi-lateral\" or \"multi-bias\" were also used to describe non-selective secondary schools. In 1946 Walworth School was one of five 'experimental' comprehensive schools set up by the London County Council although London's first purpose built comprehensive was Kidbrooke School built in 1954. An early comprehensive school was Holyhead County School in Anglesey in 1949. Coventry opened two comprehensive schools in 1954 by combining grammar schools and secondary modern schools. These were Caludon Castle School and Woodlands School. Another early example was the 1956 Tividale Comprehensive School in Tipton. The first, purpose-built comprehensive in the North of England was Colne Valley High School near Huddersfield in 1956.\nThe largest expansion of comprehensive schools resulted from a policy decision taken in 1965 by Anthony Crosland, Secretary of State for Education in the 1964\u20131970 Labour government. The policy decision was implemented by Circular 10\/65, a request to local education authorities to plan for conversion. Students sat the 11+ examination in their last year of primary education and were sent to one of a secondary modern, secondary technical or grammar school depending on their perceived ability. Secondary technical schools were never widely implemented and for 20 years there was a virtual bipartite system which saw fierce competition for the available grammar school places, which varied between 15% and 25% of total secondary places.\nIn 1970 Margaret Thatcher, the Secretary of State for Education in the new Conservative government, ended the compulsion on local authorities to convert, however, many local authorities were so far down the path that it would have been prohibitively expensive to attempt to reverse the process, and more comprehensive schools were established under Thatcher than any other education secretary. By 1975 the majority of local authorities in England and Wales had abandoned the 11-Plus examination and moved to a comprehensive system. Over that 10-year period many secondary modern schools and grammar schools were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives, whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population. By the mid-1970s the system had been almost fully implemented, with virtually no secondary modern schools remaining. Many grammar schools were either closed or changed to comprehensive status. Some local authorities, including Sandwell and Dudley in the West Midlands, changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s.\n\nIn 1976 the future Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan launched what became known as the 'great debate' on the education system. He went on to list the areas he felt needed closest scrutiny: the case for a core curriculum, the validity and use of informal teaching methods, the role of school inspection and the future of the examination system. Comprehensive school remains the most common type of state secondary school in England, and the only type in Wales. They account for around 90% of pupils, or 64% if one does not count schools with low-level selection. This figure varies by region.\nSince the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead. The concept of \"school choice\" introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original \"neighbourhood comprehensive\" model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudo-market incentive to encourage better schools. Both Conservative Party and Labour governments experimented with alternatives to the original neighbourhood comprehensive.Experiments have included:\n\npartnerships where successful schools share knowledge and best practice with nearby schools\nfederations of schools, where a partnership is formalised through joint governance arrangements\nCity Technology Colleges, 15 new schools where one fifth of the capital cost is privately funded\nAcademy schools, state schools not controlled by the local authority, which are allowed to select up to 10% of admissions by ability\nFree schools, state schools not controlled by the local authority, which are allowed to select up to 10% of admissions by abilityFollowing the advice of Sir Cyril Taylor\u2014former businessman and Conservative politician, and chairman of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT)\u2014in the mid-1990s, all parties have backed the creation of specialist schools, which focus on excellence in a particular subject and are theoretically allowed to select up to 10% of their intake. This policy consensus had brought to an end the notion that all children will go to their local school, and assumes parents will choose a school they feel most meets their child's needs.\n\nCurriculum\nAll maintained schools in England are required to follow the National Curriculum, which is made up of twelve subjects. Every state school must offer a curriculum which is balanced and broadly based and which promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society, and prepares pupils at the school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life. For each of the statutory curriculum subjects, the Secretary of State for Education is required to set out a Programme of Study which outlines the content and matters which must be taught in those subjects at the relevant Key Stages. Teachers should set high expectations for every pupil. They should plan stretching work for pupils whose attainment is significantly above the expected standard. Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious.Under the National Curriculum, all pupils undergo National Curriculum assessments at the end of Key Stage 2 in Year 6 in the core subjects of English, Mathematics and Science. Individual teacher assessment is used for foundation subjects, such as art and design, geography, history, design and technology, and computing. Pupils take GCSE exams at Key Stage 4 in Year 11, but may also choose to work towards the attainment of alternative qualifications, such as the National Vocational Qualifications and Business and Technology Education Council. Pupils take GCSEs examinations in the core English literature, English language, mathematics, science, and entitlement subjects from the arts, humanities, design and technology, and languages. The core subjects English, Mathematics and Science are compulsory for all pupils aged 5 to 16. A range of other subjects, known as foundation subjects, are compulsory in each Key Stage:\n\nArt and design\nCitizenship\nDesign and technology\nGeography\nHistory\nComputing\nForeign languages\nMusic\nPhysical educationIn addition to the compulsory subjects, pupils at Key Stage 4 have a statutory entitlement to be able to study at least one subject from the arts (comprising art and design, music, photography, dance, drama and media arts), design and technology (comprising design and technology, electronics, engineering, food preparation and nutrition), the humanities (comprising geography and history), and modern foreign languages. Optional subjects include computer science, business studies, economics, astronomy, classical civilisation, film studies, geology, psychology, sociology, ancient languages, and ancient history.The Department for Education has drawn up a list of preferred subjects known as the English Baccalaureate on the results in eight GCSEs including English, mathematics, the sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, computer science), history, geography, and an ancient or modern foreign language.All schools are required to make provision for a daily act of collective worship and must teach religious education to pupils at every key stage and sex and relationships education to pupils in secondary education. Parents can withdraw their children for all or part of the lessons. Local councils are responsible for deciding the RE syllabus, but faith schools and academies can set their own. All schools should make provision for personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE). Schools are also free to include other subjects or topics of their choice in planning and designing their own programme of education.\n\nSchool years\nChildren are normally placed in year groups determined by the age they will attain at their birthday during the school year. In most cases progression from one year group to another is based purely on chronological age, although it is possible in some circumstances for a student to repeat or skip a year. Repetition may be due to a lack of attendance, for example from a long illness, and especially in Years requiring standard tests. A child significantly more advanced than their classmates may be forwarded one or more years.\nState-funded nursery education is available from the age of 3, and may be full-time or part-time, though this is not compulsory. If registered with a state school, attendance is compulsory beginning with the term following the child's fifth birthday. Children can be enrolled in the reception year in September of that school year, thus beginning school at age 4 or 4.5. Unless the student chooses to stay within the education system, compulsory school attendance ends on the last Friday in June during the academic year in which a student attains the age of 16.In the vast majority of cases, pupils progress from primary to secondary levels at age 11; in some areas either or both of the primary and secondary levels are further subdivided. A few areas have three-tier education systems with an intermediate middle level from age 9 to 13. Years 12 and 13 are often referred to as \"lower sixth form\" and \"upper sixth form\" respectively, reflecting their distinct, voluntary nature as the A-level years. While most secondary schools enter their pupils for A-levels, some schools offer the International Baccalaureate or Cambridge Pre-U qualifications instead.\n\nScotland\nScotland has a very different educational system from England and Wales, though also based on comprehensive education. It has different ages of transfer, different examinations and a different philosophy of choice and provision. All publicly funded primary and secondary schools are comprehensive. The Scottish Government has rejected plans for specialist schools as of 2005.\n\nAustralia\nWhen the first comprehensive schools appeared in the 1950s, the Australian Government started to transition to comprehensive schooling which has been expanding and improving ever since. Prior to the transition into comprehensive schooling systems, primary and secondary state schools regularly measured students' academic merit based on their performance in public examinations. The state of Western Australia was the first to replace selective school systems, then Queensland, and finally South Australia and Victoria.The Australian education system is organised through three compulsory school types. Students commence their education in Primary school, which runs for seven or eight years, starting at kindergarten through to Year 6 or 7. The next is Secondary school which runs for three or four years, from Year 7 or 8 to Year 10. Finally, Senior Secondary school which runs for two years, completing Years 11 and 12. Each school tier follows a comprehensive curriculum that is categorised into sequences for each Year-level. The Year-level follows specific sequence content and achievement for each subject, which can be interrelated through cross-curricula. In order for students to complete and graduate each tier-level of schooling, they need to complete the subject sequences of content and achievement. Once students have completed Year 12, they may choose to enter into Tertiary education. The two-tier Tertiary education system in Australia includes both higher education (i.e.: university, college, other institutions) and vocational education and training (VET). Higher education works off of the Australian Qualifications Framework and prepares Australians for an academic route that may take them into the theoretical and philosophical lenses of their career options.\nPassage 3:\nElizabeth and After\nElizabeth and After is a novel by Matt Cohen, first published in 1999 by Knopf Canada. His final novel, it won the Governor General's Award for English-language fiction just a few weeks before Cohen's death.\n\nPlot summary\nThe story is about the lives of a few people living in a small town north of Kingston, Ontario.  Carl McKelvey, a \"white trash male\" as he describes himself, returns to the town after a three-year absence in the hope that he can live with his daughter again, and maybe even renew his relationship with his ex-wife, Chrissy.  He carries deep in his heart his guilt of having driven his car into a tree, killing his mother, Elizabeth, many years earlier.\nElizabeth's sudden death ended not only an unhappy marriage she had with William McKelvey, a failed farmer, but also a secret relationship she had with Adam Goldsmith, Carl's real father.  Elizabeth might have felt that the uncultured McKelvey ruined her life, or she might be too frightened to ruin her life herself by leaving him.  In either case, her life has affected McKelvey, Adam and Carl so deeply that her influence is still felt eleven years later.\nWhen Carl is attacked by Fred (Chrissy's boyfriend), Adam, even though reserved and gentle-natured, decides to do something for his son.  Adam takes Fred in his car and drives him into the same tree that Elizabeth's car crashed into eleven years earlier.  Both Adam and Fred are killed instantly.  Carl learns about his relationship with Adam in a letter Adam left for him.\n\nExternal links\nElizabeth and After weaves a twisted tale\nPassage 4:\nMatt Cohen (writer)\nMatthew Cohen (30 December 1942 \u2013 2 December 1999) was a Canadian writer who published both mainstream literature under his own name and children's literature under the pseudonym Teddy Jam.\n\nHistory\nMatt Cohen was born in Montreal, son of Morris Cohen and Beatrice Sohn, and was raised in Kingston and Ottawa. He studied political economy at the University of Toronto and taught political philosophy and religion at McMaster University in the late 1960s before publishing his first novel Korsoniloff in 1969.His fiction was translated into German, Dutch, French, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese.  The Spanish Doctor, his biggest international success, continues to sell well in the French and Spanish markets.\nHis greatest critical success as a writer was his final novel Elizabeth and After which won the 1999 Governor General's Award for English-language Fiction only a few weeks before his death. He had been nominated twice previously, but had not won, in 1979 for The Sweet Second Summer of Kitty Malone and in 1997 for Last Seen.\nA founding member of the Writers' Union of Canada, he served on the executive board for many years and as president in 1986. During his presidency, the Writer's Union was finally able to persuade the government of Canada to form a commission and establish a Public Lending Right program.  He also served on the Toronto Arts Council as chair of the Literary Division and was able to obtain increased funding for writers. In recognition of this work, he was awarded a Toronto Arts Award and the Harbourfront Prize.\nHe also published a number of children's books under the pseudonym Teddy Jam. Cohen's authorship of the Teddy Jam books was not revealed until after his death. Dr. Kiss, illustrated by Joanne Fitzgerald won the Governor General's Award in 1991 and Fishing Summer was also nominated for a Governor General's Award for children's literature in 1997, making Cohen one of the few writers ever to be nominated for Governor General's Awards in two different categories in the same year.\nHe was married three times; first to Arden Ford, next to Susan Bricker and then to Patsy Aldana.Cohen died at home in Toronto after a battle with lung cancer. His final book of short stories, Getting Lucky, and his final Teddy Jam title, The Kid's Line, were posthumously published in 2001. A Canadian literary award, the Matt Cohen Award, is presented in Cohen's memory by the Writers' Trust of Canada.A film adaptation of his 1990 novel Emotional Arithmetic has been produced by Triptych films starring Max von Sydow, Christopher Plummer, Gabriel Byrne and Susan Sarandon. It was the closing gala at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nBibliography\nYears link to corresponding year in literature or, for poetry, to year in poetry.\n\nNovels\nKorsoniloff (1969)\nJohnny Crackle Sings (1971)\nThe Disinherited (1974)\nWooden Hunters (1975)\nThe Colours of War (1977)\nThe Sweet Second Summer of Kitty Malone (1979)\nFlowers of Darkness (1981)\nThe Spanish Doctor (1984)\nNadine (1987)\nEmotional Arithmetic (1990)\nFreud: The Paris Notebooks (1991)\nThe Bookseller (1993)\nLast Seen (1997)\nElizabeth and After (1999)\n\nShort stories\nColumbus and the Fat Lady (1972)\nToo Bad Galahad (1972)\nNight Flights (1978)\nThe Leaves of Louise (1978)\nThe Expatriate (1982)\nCaf\u00e9 le Dog (1983)\nLife on This Planet (1985)\nLiving on Water (1988)\nRacial Memories (1990)\nLives of the Mind Slaves (1994)\nGetting Lucky (2001)\n\nPoetry\nPeach Melba (1974)\nIn Search of Leonardo (1985)\n\nNon-fiction\nTyping: A Life in 26 Keys (2000)\n\nChildren's literature (as \"Teddy Jam\")\nNight Cars (1987) illustrated by Eric Beddows\nDoctor Kiss Says Yes (1991) illustrated by Joanne Fitzgerald\nThe Year of Fire (1993) illustrated by Ian Wallace\nThe Charlotte Stories (1994)\nJacob's Best Sisters (1996) illustrated by Joanne Fitzgerald\nThe Fishing Summer (1997) illustrated by Ange Zhang\nThis New Baby (1998)\nThe Stoneboat (1999) illustrated by Ange Zhang\nttuM (1999)\nThe Kid Line (2001) illustrated by Ange Zhang\n\nSee also\nCanadian literature\nCanadian poetry\nList of Canadian poets\nList of Canadian writers\nPassage 5:\nAlgernon Methuen\nSir Algernon Marshall Stedman Methuen, Baronet (; 23 February 1856 \u2013 20 September 1924) was an English publisher and a teacher of Classics and French.  He is best known for founding the publishing company Methuen & Co.\n\nBackground and education\nMethuen was born as Algernon Methuen Marshall Stedman in London, the third son of John Buck Stedman, FRCS, and Jane Elizabeth n\u00e9e Marshall. He was educated at Berkhamsted School and then Wadham College, Oxford, from which he graduated with an MA.\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating from Oxford, Methuen entered teaching, and rose to become head of High Croft Preparatory School at Milford in Surrey from 1890 to 1895. While teaching he began, as a sideline, writing a number of school textbooks under the nom-de-plume A. W. S. Methuen, of which his series on French, Greek and Latin were best known. Among his works were books on gardening and current affairs. In June 1889, Methuen began to publish and market his own textbooks under the label Methuen & Co. (later Methuen Publishing Ltd.). Two months later he formally adopted Methuen as his surname. His first success at publishing came in 1892 with the publication of Rudyard Kipling's Barrack-Room Ballads. He later published works by Hilaire Belloc, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Oscar Wilde.\nMethuen was an outspoken critic of the Boer War. He stood for Parliament as the Liberal party candidate for the seat of Guildford in the General Election of January 1910. The seat was a safe Conservative seat and he was unsuccessful. In 1916, he was created a baronet, of Haslemere in Surrey, and he later published his own memoir.\n\nPersonal life\nMethuen married Emily Caroline Bedford in 1884. He died in September 1924, aged 68, when the baronetcy became extinct.\nPassage 6:\nJournal of Applied Philosophy\nThe Journal of Applied Philosophy is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the Society for Applied Philosophy and edited by Elizabeth Brake (Rice University).

It is a realty and taxation game intended to educate users about Georgism. It is the inspiration for the 1935 board game Monopoly.\n\nHistory\nIn 1902 to 1903, Magie designed the game and play tested it in Arden, Delaware. The game was created to be a \"practical demonstration of the present system of land grabbing with all its usual outcomes and consequences\". She based the game on the economic principles of Georgism, a system proposed by Henry George, with the object of demonstrating how rents enrich property owners and impoverish tenants. She knew that some people could find it hard to understand why this happened and what might be done about it, and she thought that if Georgist ideas were put into the concrete form of a game, they might be easier to demonstrate. Magie also hoped that when played by children the game would provoke their natural suspicion of unfairness, and that they might carry this awareness into adulthood.The Landlord's Game has some similarities to the basic rules of the board game Zohn Ahl, played by the Kiowa Indians of North America. There are hints that suggest Elizabeth Magie might have known Zohn Ahl and incorporated some of the game's ideas.\nIn 1903, Magie filed for a patent on the game which was granted in 1904.  Magie and fellow Georgists formed a company, Economic Game Company, in 1906 New York to publish the game. Besides Magie, the incorporators were E. H. Monroe of Chicago and E. G. Lenbusher of New York. Magie approached Parker Brothers to publish this and one other game in 1909. The other game was accepted while Landlord's was rejected as too complicated.In the United Kingdom The Landlord's Game was first published in 1913 by the Newbie Game Company, formed by a Liberal Committee from the village of Newbie in Dumfries, under the title Brer Fox an' Brer Rabbit; although, despite the title change, it was recognizably the same game. Landlord sold well in the Northeast amongst its left-wing intellectuals, while Brer was unsuccessful.Scott Nearing, socialist professor of economics at Wharton School of Finance from 1906 to 1915, lived in Arden in 1910, where Magie invented the game, learned about the game and taught it to his students. College students made up their own boards to use with her rules. Various versions of the game popped up over the following years under a variety of names, Monopoly, Finance, and Auction being among them. Among the Atlantic City and Philadelphia communities of Quakers, the game was particularly popular with college students and economics professors. Jesse and Eugene Raiford, Quakers in Atlantic City, used household items instead of pawns and changed the properties to those of Atlantic City.With Magie's first patent having expired, in 1923, Magie decided to attempt to regain control by applying for another patent. On September 23, 1924, a second patent was issued to Magie for The Landlord's Game. Adgame Company (Inc.) published Landlord's Game and Prosperity under this patent in 1932.Robert Baron had Parker Brothers design its own version, Fortune, before negotiation to purchase her patents in case the discussion fell apart or she sold to another potential buyer, Dave Knapp, publisher of Finance. Magie held the patent until 1935, when she sold it to Parker Brothers for $500, equivalent to $10,672 in 2022. The company had recently started distributing Monopoly, which it purchased from Charles Darrow who claimed to have invented it.  The company only printed a very small run of the game to secure the copyright. Surviving copies of The Landlord's Game by Parker Brothers are considered by many the rarest of all 20th century board games. Parker Brothers pushed her game aside for Darrow's by 1936. Magie then did two interviews showcasing copies of the original board with The Washington Post and The Evening Star to show that Darrow was not the inventor of the game.In 1937, Carnival was published based on the 1904 version. Parker Brothers published their edition of the game in 1939.In a 2004 episode of PBS' History Detectives (title: \"Monopoly; Japanese Internment Camp Artwork; The Lewis and Clark Cane\"), the show investigated a game board belonging to a Delaware man, having an intermediate version of a game combining elements of The Landlord's Game and Monopoly. The investigators concluded that this game board was the missing link that proves that Monopoly was derived from The Landlord's Game.\n\nDescription\nThe set had rules for two different games, anti-monopolist and  Monopolist. The anti-monopolist rules reward all players during wealth creation, whereas the monopolist rules incentivize forming monopolies and forcing opponents out of the game. In the anti-monopolist or Single Tax version (later called \"Prosperity\"), the game is won when the player with the least money doubles their original stake.The board featured a track around the outside edge of the board split into blocks representing properties and had their purchase price, and their rental value listed in the block. New York City's Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and Wall Street were the top properties in price and rent. The published game included Chance cards with quotes attributed to Thomas Jefferson, John Ruskin and Andrew Carnegie.From the 1904 patented version to the published 1906 version, the property names were changed and the rule for increased rent for multiple railroads owned was added.\n\nPatents\nThe game's first patent was the first issued for a game while claiming four features in the application, the most important feature was a continuous path game. At the time, most games had a start and end spot. With the first patent having expired in 1921, Magie applied for another patent with five new claims.\nThe claims of Magie's second patent could not include those of the first (now in the public domain) and leaned more towards the single tax theory of play. One common misconception is that Parker Brothers acquired the rights to Magie's original invention of Monopoly play and the unique design by purchasing the later 1924 patent. Parker Brothers acquired Magie's patent to The Landlord's Game but although both patents had the same name they covered different claims. The substitution or confusion of the early patent for the latter is still commonplace.\n\nSee also\nRalph Anspach's Anti-Monopoly\nBertell Ollman's Class Struggle\nPassage 8:\nNicholas Eftimiades\nNicholas Eftimiades is an American government official, author, and educator best known for his work Chinese Intelligence Operations (1994). He currently resides in the Tokyo area. He is a current professor at Penn State Harrisburg.\n\nEducation\nEftimiades graduated from George Washington University with a B.A. in East Asian Studies and the National Defense Intelligence College with a M.S. in Strategic Intelligence.  He also did undergraduate and graduate work in Asia.  He is a Visiting Research Fellow at King's College, War Studies Department, London, United Kingdom.\n\nGovernment career\nNicholas Eftimiades' 30 year government career includes seven years at the National Security Space Office leading engineering teams designing \"generation after next\" national security space capabilities. He was also Senior Technical Officer in the Defense Intelligence Agency, Future's Division, and Chief of DIA's Space Division. He served as DIA's lead for national space policy and strategy development.Mr. Eftimiades has provided numerous briefings and testimony on national security, technology, and space exploration issues to senior policy officials and the U.S. Congress. He testified before the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy   He has sponsored and chaired international conferences on U.S. and foreign defense policy issues.  He is a frequent lecturer and public speaker on future technology and societal changes and national security issues.\n\nChinese Intelligence Operations\nEftimiades first came into public view in 1994 with the publication of his book Chinese Intelligence Operations (Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland., March 1994). The book is an examination of the structure, operations, and methodology of the intelligence services of the People's Republic of China. The book received worldwide recognition with the Chinese government declaring Eftimiades \"an enemy of the people\" in the People's Daily newspaper. To date, the book remains the only scholarly analysis of China's intelligence services and operational methodology.Chinese Intelligence Operations gained worldwide attention when one of the Chinese companies identified as having a relationship with China's intelligence services was identified as a donor to the Bill Clinton presidential campaign through the Democratic National Committee. This revelation resulted in Eftimiades appearing on TV, radio, and being quoted in newspapers.  He appeared on CBS Evening News with Connie Chung, Dateline NBC, ABC's Day One, BBC America, National Public Radio and many other television and radio broadcasts.   Some organizations protested the CBS news broadcast as being racist. Eftimiades testified before the U.S. Congress on several occasions.\n\nScience Fiction\nEftimiades' most recent work is a political and philosophical satire entitled Edward of Planet Earth.  The book is influenced by authors such as Alexander Zinoviev and Ignazio Silone\u2014names not normally associated with science fiction.  The story takes place 200 years in the future and centers on a man, his computer friends, a female companion and their quest to communicate with God.\n\nNon-Profit Activity\nIn 2001, Eftimiades founded a non-profit educational organization entitled the Federation of Galaxy Explorers to inspire youth interest in science and engineering.  Students in the Galaxy Explorers program attend after school \"Mission Team\" meetings where they participate in hands-on lessons that support National Science Education Standards. Mission Team members are rewarded for participation and achievements with ribbons, patches, medals, and certificates.  In addition to Mission Teams, Galaxy Explorers also have Summer Camps, Star Parities, and the Battle of the Rockets Competition.\nPassage 9:\nStephen Henry Parker\nSir Stephen Henry Parker  (7 November 1846 \u2013 13 December 1927) was a lawyer and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia from 1906 to 1914.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nStephen Henry Parker was the second son of Stephen Stanley Parker (1817\u20131904) and his wife Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Sewell. He was the grandson of Stephen Parker (c.\u20091795 \u2013 1879), a pioneer settler in York, Western Australia. Parker was educated at the Bishop's School, Perth, and was called to the bar in 1868.\n\nCareer\nHe became a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council and advocated responsible government for the colony. In 1878 he moved for the introduction of a bill to amend the constitution, but this motion was defeated. A constitution bill for responsible government was passed by the Legislative Council on 26 April 1889, but was met with some opposition in the British House of Commons. It was suggested and agreed that a delegation consisting of the retiring governor, Sir Frederick Broome, Sir Thomas Cockburn-Campbell and Parker should go to London to see the bill through the British parliament. The delegation was able to give a good answer to all objections raised, and subsequently the bill was passed and became law.\nHe served as colonial secretary in the John Forrest ministry from October 1892 to December 1894 when he retired. He was also chairman of the Perth City Council from November 1877 to 1879, for a few months in 1880-81 and Mayor from February to October 1892. In 1881, he joined with his brother George to form the well known law firm Parker and Parker (which in 1997 merged with the Perth office of Freehill Hollingdale & Page).\n\nPersonal life and death\nHe married Amey Katharine Leake, daughter of George Walpole Leake on 27 July 1872.  She died in 1914.  They had four sons and seven daughters who reached adulthood. Their second son Hubert Stanley Wyborn Parker (1883-1966) was the member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for North-East Fremantle in 1930-33, and of the Western Australian Legislative Council for Metropolitan-Suburban province in 1934-54. He was attorney-general for two months in 1933 and chief secretary in 1948-50.\nParker, and his brother George, were heavily involved with the East Perth (now known as Perth) Cricket Club in the W.A.C.A. Competition. He was club President from 1899 to 1903.\nHe died on 13 December 1927.\n\nSee also\nJudiciary of Australia\nPassage 10:\nElizabeth Blanchard (educator)\nElizabeth Blanchard (1834\u20131891) was an American educator who was the seventh president of Mount Holyoke College (as Principal and Acting President).\nBlanchard graduated from Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1858, and taught there for twelve years before becoming the Associate Principal from 1872-1883.  She served as Principal from 1883-1888.  When Mount Holyoke Female Seminary received its collegiate charter and became Mount Holyoke College, she served as Acting President from 1888-1889.\n\nSee also\nPresidents of Mount Holyoke College\nPassage 11:\nElizabeth Gertrude Britton\nElizabeth Gertrude Britton (n\u00e9e Knight) (January 9, 1858 \u2013 February 25, 1934) was an American botanist, bryologist, and educator. She and her husband, Nathaniel Lord Britton played a significant role in the fundraising and creation of the New York Botanical Garden. She was a co-founder of the predecessor of the American Bryological and Lichenological Society. She was an activist for the protection of wildflowers, inspiring local chapter activities and the passage of legislation. Elizabeth Britton made major contributions to the literature of mosses, publishing 170 papers in that field.\n\nEarly life and family\nElizabeth Gertrude Knight was born on January 9, 1858, in New York City, one of five daughters, to James and Sophie Anne (n\u00e9e Compton) Knight. Her family operated a furniture factory and sugar plantation in the vicinity of Matanzas, Cuba, and she spent much of her childhood there. In later childhood, she attended a private school in New York before attending Normal College (later, Hunter College). She graduated from Normal College in 1875, at the early age of seventeen. On August 27, 1885, she married Nathaniel Lord Britton, an assistant in geology at Columbia College who shared her growing interest in botany. The couple had no children.\n\nCareer\nAfter graduation in 1875, Elizabeth Knight joined the staff of Normal College as a critic teacher. She joined the Torrey Botanical Club in 1879, and in 1881 she published her first scientific paper in that organization's Bulletin, reporting observations of unexpected white flowers in two species of plants. She also observed the presence of a curlygrass fern, Schizaea pusilla, in Nova Scotia. In 1883, she became a tutor in natural science. It was at this time that she began to specialize in bryology and her first paper concerning mosses appeared. Britton collected fertile specimens of Eustichium norvegicum in Wisconsin and wrote the first description of its fruits. Although known since 1827, the plant had hitherto been known only in a sterile condition. Her Observer articles were models of popular scientific writings on plants which had \u201cfanciful\u201d titles like \u201cThe Humpbacked Elves\u201d and \u201cThe Brownies.\u201dAfter her marriage in 1885, Britton resigned her teaching position at Normal College, and took charge of the moss collections at Columbia in an unofficial, unpaid capacity. She served as editor of the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club from 1886 to 1888; in 1889, she published the first of an eleven-part series of papers titled Contributions to American Bryology in that journal. Her catalogue of the mosses of West Virginia appeared in 1892, and the first of eight articles titled How to Study the Mosses for a popular magazine was published in 1894. These papers \"sufficed to place Mrs. Britton in command of the bryological field in America.\" She worked with her husband to acquire for Columbia the moss herbarium of August Jaeger of Switzerland; Britton persuaded wealthy friends to contribute the necessary $6,000.\nBritton, along with her husband, was one of the Torrey Botanical Club members who spurred the establishment of the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG). The couple also travelled to England in 1888 where Nathaniel was performing research at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. At Kew Nathaniel worked on the Bolivian botanical collections of Henry Hurd Rusby, a gift to Columbia; meanwhile, Elizabeth worked on mosses at the Linnean Society of London. Inspired by the quality and quantity of Kew's herbarium, library, and gardens, the couple set about organizing an institution of comparable stature for New York. A Club meeting was held in October, 1888 where rich and prominent citizens were recruited as incorporators. The Botanical Garden was established by act of the state legislature in 1891. Britton was important in the efforts to raise funds for the organization in the 1890s. Her husband became the first director of the Botanical Garden in 1896, whilst she volunteered there. It was largely through her interest that the collection of liverworts and mosses of William Mitten was acquired for the NYBG in 1906. In recognition of her service, Britton was named Honorary Curator of the Mosses in 1912, a post which she held until her death.Britton enumerated the ferns in the Rusby collection in 1888 and she published her examination of the Rusby mosses in 1896.\n\nBritton travelled to various locations in the United States to collect botanical specimens, including the Great Dismal Swamp, the Adirondack Mountains, and the mountains of North Carolina. She accompanied Nathaniel on 23 of the 25 trips he made to the islands of the Caribbean and West Indies. Under her own name, she published her findings in the Bulletin in 1913\u20131915. Britton wrote the chapters concerning mosses for Nathaniel's Flora of Bermuda and The Bahama Flora.Britton worked with organizations to promote the study of mosses, especially by women scientists and she chaired the division of Bryophyta for the (Women's) National Science Club (NWSC) in 1897.As part of her unofficial position at Columbia, Britton acted as advisor to doctoral students, including James Franklin Collins and Abel Joel Grout. Together, in 1898 Grout and Britton founded the Sullivant Moss Chapter of the Agassiz Association. By 1908, it was known as the Sullivant Moss Society (and after 1949, as the American Bryological and Lichenological Society). Although relations between the two researchers later became chilly, Britton continued to participate in the Society, contributing articles to The Bryologist, its journal, and serving as its president from 1916 to 1919.Britton continued to study plants other than mosses. She published A Revision of the North American Species of Ophioglossum, the adder's-tongue ferns, in 1897. With Delia West Marble, she collected the type specimen of Thelypteris brittonae, a species of maiden fern, in 1906. Britton collected the type specimen for the orchid now named Britton's shadow witch (Ponthieva brittoniae).\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, Britton began to devote her time to the conservation of wildflowers. A gift of $3,000 by Olivia and Caroline Phelps Stokes to the NYBG spurred the creation of the Wild Flower Preservation Society of America. The first meeting was held on April 23, 1902 where Frederick Vernon Coville was elected president, Charles Louis Pollard was elected secretary, and Britton was elected to the Board of Managers. Other members of the board included Charles Edwin Bessey, Liberty Hyde Bailey, William Trelease, Charles Frederick Millspaugh and Alice Eastwood. Britton went on to serve as secretary and treasurer of the organization. The Society established numerous local chapters. It was incorporated in the state of New York in 1915, then reorganized as the Wild Flower Preservation Society in 1925, with Percy L. Ricker as its head. Britton promoted the cause for nearly 35 years, by publishing, lecturing, and conducting correspondence; her efforts led to adoption of legislation in various states, as well as local conservation activities in garden clubs and public schools. She published fourteen articles in the NYBG's Journal under the series title of Wild Plants Needing Protection.\nIn 1925, as chair of the conservation committee of the Federated Garden Clubs of New York State, Britton successfully led a boycott campaign against the common practice of harvesting wild American holly for use as a Christmas decoration. As a substitute, she promoted the propagation of the plant by cuttings for commercial use.\nAll told, during the period 1881 to 1930, Britton published 346 papers, of which 170 dealt with mosses. She wrote descriptions of six families of mosses for the New York Botanical Garden's Flora of America. Marshall Avery Howe described Britton as \"a woman of extraordinary physical and mental energy\u2014the possessor of a remarkably quick and brilliant intellect. She has left an enduring record in the literature of science, and her well-directed activities have had an outstanding influence in the conservation of the native flora of the United States.\"\n\nWild Plants Needing Protection\nWild Plants Needing Protection, written by Britton, is a New York Botanical Garden journal comprising fourteen articles. In the journal, she gives an in depth description of different wild plants and their importance to their environment. Each plant section included an illustration of the plant described, while also giving descriptions of both the scientific and historical background of the plants. This is shown in Britton\u2019s journal of \u201cSpring Beauty\u201d: \n\n\u201cThe Spring Beauty was named by Linnaeus in 1753 in honor of John Clayton, an American botanist, and correspondent, who wrote, in 1743, a flora of Virginia.\" Britton then goes over how there are about twenty-five species of Claytonia plants. Her Journal entry of \u201cWild Pink\u201d is an example of her descriptions which is conveyed within the writing when she states:\u201cbefore the trees cast much shade, while their greens are still so exquisitely fresh and varied, a bright flash of color will attract the eye to the Wild Pink, growing in hilly places on rocks or often in their cracks and crevices with the Saxifrage.\"\n\nRecognition and legacy\nIn 1893, Britton was the only woman among the 25 scientists nominated for charter membership in the Botanical Society of America. In 1905, she was one of three bryologists appointed to the nomenclature committee that would report to the 1910 meeting of the International Botanical Congress in Brussels. In 1906, Britton was one of only nineteen women listed in the first edition of American Men of Science. Her entry was marked with an asterisk: this \"starred\" listing was limited to the top 1,000 scientists in the book, as determined by the editors. Britton was starred in the five editions of the book that appeared through 1933.The moss genus Bryobrittonia is named for Elizabeth Britton, as well as fifteen species of plants and one of animals.Mount Britton, a double peak in El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico, honors both of the Brittons.In 1940, a memorial plaque in honor of Britton was installed in the new Wild Flower Garden of the New York Botanical Garden. A gift of the New York Bird and Tree Club, it is mounted on a ten-ton boulder of Bronx schist, and its text reads, \"Let those who find pleasure in this garden remember Elizabeth Gertrude Knight Britton, lover of wildflowers and ardent advocate of their protection\". The garden is now known as the Native Plant Garden, and the boulder as Britton Rock.Today, the Elizabeth Gertrude Knight Britton archive is held by the NYBG Mertz Library. It includes personal papers, manuscripts and published research, artwork and photographs, and printing plates. The archive documents Britton's teaching career at Normal College, as well as her participation in the Torrey Botanical Club and the NYBG. Her field notebooks can be found in the New York Botanical Garden Collectors' Field Notebook collection.The character of Alma Whittaker in the 2013 novel The Signature of All Things, by Elizabeth Gilbert, is modeled in part on Britton.\n\nLater life and death\nElizabeth Britton died at her home at 2965 Decatur Avenue in The Bronx on February 25, 1934, following an apoplectic stroke; her husband Nathaniel survived her by four months. Although she was nominally a member of the Episcopalian faith, she was buried in the Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island, where her husband's ancestors had been early settlers and he held property.\n\nSelected publications\nSee also\nThe Britton Cottage\nTimeline of women in science\nPassage 12:\nMary Gaunt\nMary Eliza Bakewell Gaunt (20 February 1861 \u2013 19 January 1942) was an Australian novelist and writer. born in Chiltern, Victoria. She also wrote collections of short stories, novellas, autobiographies, and non-fiction. She published her first novel Dave's Sweetheart in 1894. Gaunt visited many countries in her life and she wrote about her experiences in five travel books.\n\nEarly life and education\nMary was the elder daughter of William Henry Gaunt, a Victorian county court judge and Elizabeth Gaunt, n\u00e9e Palmer (c. 1835\u20131922), and was born in Chiltern, Victoria. She was educated at Grenville College, Ballarat and the University of Melbourne, being one of the first two women students to be admitted there.\n\nCareer\nShe began writing for the press and in 1894 published her first novel Dave's Sweetheart. In the same year she married Dr Hubert Lindsay Miller (a widower) of Warrnambool, Victoria. He died in 1900, and, with only a small income, Gaunt (now also known as Mrs Mary Miller) went to London intending to earn a living by her writing. Gaunt left Melbourne on 15 March 1901 and never returned.\nGaunt had difficulties at first but eventually established herself, and was able to travel in the West Indies, in West Africa, and in China and other parts of the East. Her experiences were recorded in five pleasantly written travel books: Alone in West Africa (1912), A Woman in China (1914), A Broken Journey (1919), Where the Twain Meet (1922), Reflection - in Jamaica (1932). In 1929 she also published George Washington and the Men Who Made the American Revolution. Between 1895 and 1934, 16 novels or collections of short stories were published, mostly with love and adventure interests. Three other novels were written in collaboration with John Ridgwell Essex. A collection of interviews with Mary were published in the 1925 Girls' Own Annual under the headings \"Pioneering for Women\" parts I, II, and III, and \"Strange Journeys I Have Made\".\nFrom the early 1920s, Gaunt lived mostly at Bordighera, Italy. In 1940 she fled Italy and died at Cannes in 1942. She had no children.\nShe had a sister Lucy, and brothers Cecil, Clive, Guy and Ernest; Guy and Ernest were both admirals of the Royal Navy, and Guy later became a Conservative Member of Parliament.\n\nBibliography\nNovels\nDave's Sweetheart (1894)\nKirkham's Find (1897)\nDeadman's: An Australian Story (1898)\nMistress Betty Carew (1903)\nThe Arm of the Leopard: A West African Story (1904) [with John Ridgwell Essex]\nFools Rush In (1906) [with John Ridgwell Essex]\nThe Silent Ones (1909) [with John Ridgwell Essex]\nThe Mummy Moves (1910)\nThe Uncounted Cost (1910)\nEvery Man's Desire (1913)\nA Wind from the Wilderness (1919)\nAs the Whirlwind Passeth (1923)\nThe Forbidden Town (1926)\nSaul's Daughter (1927)\nThe Lawless Frontier (1929)\nJoan of the Pilchard (1930)\nHarmony: A Tale of the Old Slave Days of Jamaica (1933)\nWorlds Away (1934)\n\nNovellas\nBingley's Gap (1888)\nDown in the World (1893)\nThe Other Man (1894)\n\nShort story collections\nThe Moving Finger (1895)\nThe Ends of the Earth : Stories (1915)\nThe Surrender and Other Happenings (1920)\nLife at Deadman's : Stories of Colonial Victoria (2001)\n\nAutobiography\nAlone in West Africa (1912)\nA Woman in China (1914)\nA Broken Journey: Wanderings from the Hoang-Ho to Saghalien (1919)\n\nNon-fiction\nWhere the Twain Meet (1922) - travel\nPeeps at Great Men : George Washington and the Men Who Made the American Revolution (1929) - children's\nReflection in Jamaica (1932) - travel\n\nNotes and references\nSources\nE.

PSAT is duly registered by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. All PSAT programs are accredited by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).\nHistory: \nPangasinan School of Arts and Trades (PSAT) is an outgrowth of the intermediate school organized by American Roy E. Blackman in 1904.  It served as a normal training department for teachers who intended to teach shopwork in the different municipalities of Pangasinan.  Through the late Provincial Governor, Hon. Isabelo Artacho, the Pangasinan Trade School building was constructed in its present site in 1907.\nMr. Jorge Garcia was the first Filipino principal and was succeeded by Martin Mendoza.  It was during the incumbency of Mr. Mendoza in 1923 that the first year high school level of the trade school was introduced.\nIn 1920 the first batch of students of the four-year trade curriculum graduated.  The shop courses offered then were Woodworking, Building Construction and Automotive.\nIn 1929 \u2013 1930, the Pangasinan Vocational High School emerged as an offshoot of the merger of Home Economics Education, Normal Training Department and Trade Courses Program.\nIn 1935 \u2013 1936, the Pangasinan High School and the Pangasinan Vocational High School were fused into one high school known as the Pangasinan Secondary School.\nIn 1939 \u2013 1940, the Pangasinan Vocational High School became known as Pangasinan Trade School, an entirely separate entity from the Pangasinan High School of which it has earlier been a part.\nOn August 15, 1945, the Pangasinan Trade School was temporarily opened at Dagupan City due to the construction of the buildings in Lingayen.\nOn March 14, 1953, by virtue of Republic Act 704, the Pangasinan Trade School was converted into a National School of Arts and Trades and named as Pangasinan School of Arts and Trades (PSAT) whose curricular offerings were expanded to include Master of Arts in Vocational Technical Education, major in Practical Arts.  This gave PSAT the distinction of being the only vocational school offering graduate studies, in Region I.\nIn 1987, the offering of post-secondary technical-vocational education was retrieved from the Pangasinan State University which brought with it all post-secondary courses upon its conversion as a state university in 1978 and only the secondary courses were left with PSAT.\nIn 1990, PSAT  was elevated as a Higher Technical Education institution by virtue of Republic Act 7078.\nIn 1995, PSAT was transferred t the administrative supervision of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) by virtue o Republic Act 7845. It was, however, only in 1997 that PSAT became a full-fledged CSI (CHED-Supervised Institution).\nOn April 25, 2000, by virtue of CHED-TESDA Memorandum of Agreement, PSAT was transferred to the administrative supervision of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).\nOn May 10, 2000 the Joint CHED-TESDA Memorandum Circular  No. 1, s. 2000, the Implementing Guidelines on the Transfer of CHED-Supervised Institutions (CSIs) to Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) was issued. Dr. Geronimo S. dela Cruz, Sr. was the first Vocational School Superintendent of PSAT under TESDA supervision.\nOn April 1, 2001, Dr. Lina C. Alcantara took over as the Officer-In-Charge.  It was during her term when eleven (11) of the school offerings were registered under UTPRAS.  Three courses (Garments, Computer Technician and Hotel and Restaurant Technology) were registered WTR and seven (7) courses were registered NTR.\nOn August 3, 2005, Manuel A. Jaramilla, Ph. D. assumed the position of Officer-In-Charge.  It was during his term when Short-term courses were first offered which eventually boomed.   It was also during his term when 16 courses were registered under WTR status in June, 2007.  Technology Trainers were also granted Trainers\u2019 Qualification I (TQ I) in support of the Competency Based Training Delivery.\nOn June 1, 2008, Clemencia T. Ibarra, CSEE and Civil Service Commission Local Scholarship Program \u2013 Masteral Degree Program and University of the Philippines Scholarship recipient assumed her post as Vocational School Superintendent I.\nHer leadership and administration shall anchor in the full implementation of Competency Based Training Delivery, registration of short-term courses under WTR Status, institutional application and accreditation by Asia Pacific Accreditation and Certification Commission (APACC), improvement of school facilities, Instructional and Administrative Staff Development and Welfare Benefit Program, efficiency and transparency on school\u2019s communication, financial, administrative, and supplies management, systems and processes, and institutionalization of income generating project.\n\nProgram Offerings\nJunior & Senior High School\nAutomotive Servicing NC II\nBread and Pastry Production NC II\nCommercial Cooking NC II\nComputer Hardware Servicing NC II\nConsumer Electronics Servicing NC II\nDressmaking NC II\nElectrical Installation and Maintenance NC II\nFood and Beverage Services NC II\nFront Office Services NC II\nHairdressing NC II\nHousekeeping NC II\nShielded Metal Arc Welding NC II\nTrainer's Methodology Level I\n\nExternal links\nTESDA Accredited Assessment Centers \u2013 Pangasinan School of Arts and Trades\nPassage 14:\nArthur Kroker\nArthur Kroker (born 1945) is a Canadian author, editor, educator and researcher of political science, technology and culture.\n\nLife and career\nHe earned a PhD in political science from McMaster University in 1975. In addition to being a professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Kroker serves as director of the Pacific Centre for Technology and Culture (PACTAC), located at the university. Kroker was appointed to the Canada Research Chair in technology, culture and theory in 2003. He is the editor for the online academic journal CTheory, an international journal of theory, technology and culture.\nKroker has been an outspoken critic of the transformation of the early internet into a consumer-driven system (\"virtual class\").

Poptropica was primarily the creation of Jeff Kinney, the author of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. As of 2015, he remains at the company as the Creative Director. The game primarily focuses on problem-solving through game quest scenarios, called \"islands\". Islands all center on a problem that the player must resolve by going through multiple obstacles, collecting and using items, talking to various characters, and completing goals. All islands, upon completion, award \"credits,\" which are non-negotiable currency that may be used to buy costumes and special effects in the Poptropica store.\nIn 2011, Poptropica was listed on Time magazine's list of \"50 Websites that Make the Web Great\", where it was described as \"an inventive megasite for kids with a wholesome and slightly educational bent\". By 2012, the game had grown to have over 75 million registered users, with 35 million in the 15-25 age group. Versions of the game have been released on Nintendo DS and 3DS, iOS, and Android mobile devices. In May 2015, it was announced that Family Education Network was sold by Pearson to the interactive-education venture capitalist Sandbox Networks, and that Poptropica had \"over 3.2 million monthly unique users in 200 countries and territories\".In 2015, Poptropica was sold to educational-technology investment group, Sandbox Partners.In 2020, because of the discontinuation of Adobe Flash, Poptropica began porting their old islands that were built on Adobe Flash over to an HTML5 format. As a result of Poptropica's utilization of varying Flash engines, a number of islands were unable to be ported immediately, and were effectively removed from the game. Fan archivists later made 35 islands available once again via the Basilisk browser within the Flashpoint program.In April 2022, Poptropica announced that some of the old islands would return as part of a bundle on Steam. Though delayed by a day, the game was eventually released on May 26, 2022, and includes seventeen islands and Poptropica Realms.\n\nGameplay\nWhen it first launched in 2007, Poptropica only had one island, titled Early Poptropica Island. By 2017, it had 58 islands to be explored, all with a different theme: examples include Back Lot Island, where the player helps produce a movie, and Super Power Island, where their goal is to defeat six super villains. Each island had its own quest, for which a player could receive an island medallion as well as 150 credits to spend in the in-game Poptropica Store. Starting July 6, 2011, Poptropica allowed players to replay islands without creating a new account, while still keeping track of all the Medallions the player had earned.\n\nAdvertisements\nIn addition to the available island quests, advertisers contract for temporary mini-games that appear on the site, sometimes targeted to players of a certain age group or gender. Regular advertisers have included Disney, Kellogg's Froot Loops, Lego toys, and various animated movies and DVD releases. Advertisement mini-games normally appear only during a two-week period. If the player completes an advertisement mini-game, they receive a temporary prize, usually related to the media being advertised.\nA few Poptropica islands are themed after certain book series: these include Big Nate, Timmy Failure, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Magic Tree House. These islands are permanent, and can be played at any time. In 2015, a total of seven of these islands became members-only.\n\nMini-games\nPoptropica features different mini-games that users can play with other people. These include Switch, Sudoku, Hoops, Sky Dive, Paint War, Star Link, Balloons, Soupwords and Pathwise. The game keeps track of how many times the player wins or loses a certain mini-game.\n\nSpin-offs\nPoptropica Adventures\nIn 2012, in partnership with Ubisoft, Poptropica released a video game for the Nintendo DS, titled Poptropica Adventures.\n\nPoptropica: Forgotten Islands\nOn September 5, 2013, Poptropica launched Poptropica: Forgotten Islands, an iOS game, which allows players to meet new characters and discover story elements about Poptropica by finding artifacts littered throughout the game. It was also released on the Nintendo 3DS system through Ubisoft in 2014. It has been replaced on iOS and Android with a mobile version of the desktop Poptropica game.\n\nPoptropica Worlds\nOn January 11, 2017, Poptropica announced via their blog that they were introducing another game called Poptropica Worlds, developed in Unity. It was released in spring 2017. Poptropica Worlds has new features, such as redesigned characters, customizable homes, and new islands. Returning players are able to port over their avatar's look and name to Poptropica Worlds. Poptropica Worlds can be played on both the web and mobile. If membership was bought for Poptropica, it carries over to Poptropica Worlds, and vice versa.","label":"longbench","length":15993,"title":"Passage 1:"}

She was a member of the House of Capet.\nShe was Duchess of Brabant by her marriage to John III, Duke of Brabant. Her paternal grandmother being Marie of Brabant, she was a great-granddaughter of Henry III, Duke of Brabant and so, her husband's second cousin.\nMarie was the eldest of five children born to her parents. Marie's younger siblings included: Charles d'\u00c9vreux; Lord of \u00c9tampes, Philip III of Navarre; husband of Joan II of Navarre, and Jeanne d'\u00c9vreux; Queen of France by her marriage to Charles IV of France.\n\nMarriage\nIn 1311, Marie married John III, Duke of Brabant as his father's gesture of rapprochement with France.\nThey had six children:\n\nJoanna, Duchess of Brabant (1322\u20131406)\nMargaret of Brabant (February 9, 1323 \u2013 1368), married at Saint-Quentin on June 6, 1347 Louis II of Flanders\nMarie of Brabant (1325 \u2013 March 1, 1399), Lady of Turnhout, married at Tervuren on July 1, 1347 Reginald III of Guelders\nJohn (1327\u20131335\/36)\nHenri (d. October 29, 1349)\nGodfrey (d. aft.

Her two siblings were John of Luxembourg and Marie of Luxembourg, Queen of France.\n\nLife\nAt the time of his death (1313), Emperor Henry VII initiated the negotiations for a marriage between Beatrice and Charles, Duke of Calabria, son and heir of King Robert of Naples, and also planned to marry again (his wife was already dead in 1311) with Catherine of Habsburg. Beatrice was called by her father to Italy, where she arrived with her paternal grandmother, Beatrice d'Avesnes. The marriage plans with the Duke of Calabria failed, and the Emperor began negotiations for a marriage with Prince Peter of Sicily, eldest son and heir of King Frederick III; however, the current political conflicts between the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily soon ended this planned betrothal too.\nWhen King Charles I of Hungary (whose first wife Maria of Bytom, had died in 1317) decided to marry again, he sent to the Kingdom of Bohemia two representants, Thomas Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi and Simon Kacsics, in addition to an interpreter, a bourgeois from Szopro\u0144skim called Stephen, in order to find a bride. King John called his two sisters to his court; at that moment, Marie resided in St. Marienthal Abbey and Beatrice remained in Italy. Both princesses arrived to Prague on 20 June 1318, and three days later, the Hungarian envoys met both girls at the monastery of Zbraslav, where the Bohemian king gave them the opportunity to choose between them their future queen. After a calculated assessment of both personal and physical attitudes, they chose Beatrice. Soon after, the formal engagement took place, and the young bride parted with the Hungarian entourage to her new home. On the border of the Kingdom of Hungary she was officially welcomed by Charles I's messengers. Beatrice and Charles I married at the Octave of Saint Martin (between 12 and 17 November) and she was crowned Queen of Hungary in the ceremony.\nBeatrice became pregnant in 1319. In November, she went into labour but died while giving birth. The child was stillborn. She was buried at Nagyv\u00e1rad Cathedral.\nPassage 4:\nMatilda of Brabant, Countess of Artois\nMatilda of Brabant (14 June 1224 \u2013 29 September 1288) was the eldest daughter of Henry II, Duke of Brabant and his first wife Marie of Hohenstaufen.\n\nMarriages and children\nOn 14 June 1237, which was her 13th birthday, Matilda married her first husband Robert I of Artois. Robert was the son of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile. They had:\n\nBlanche of Artois (1248 \u2013 2 May 1302). Married first Henry I of Navarre and secondly Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster.\nRobert II, Count of Artois (1250 \u2013 11 July 1302 at the Battle of the Golden Spurs).On 8 February 1250, Robert I was killed while participating in the Seventh Crusade.  On 16 January 1255, Matilda married her second husband Guy III, Count of Saint-Pol. He was a younger son of Hugh I, Count of Blois and Mary, Countess of Blois. They had:\n\nHugh II, Count of Blois (died 1307), Count of Saint Pol and later Count of Blois\nGuy IV, Count of Saint-Pol (died 1317), Count of Saint Pol\nJacques I of Leuze-Ch\u00e2tillon (died 11 July 1302 at the Battle of the Golden Spurs), first of the lords of Leuze, married Catherine de Cond\u00e9 and had issue; his descendants brought Cond\u00e9, Carency, etc. into the House of Bourbon.\nBeatrix (died 1304), married John I of Brienne, Count of Eu\nJeanne, married Guillaume III de Chauvigny, Lord of Ch\u00e2teauroux\nGertrude, married Florent, Lord of Mechelen (French: Malines).\nPassage 5:\nMarie of Brabant, Countess of Savoy\nMarie of Brabant (1277\/80\u20131338), was a Countess Consort of Savoy by marriage to Amadeus V, Count of Savoy. She was the daughter of John I, Duke of Brabant and Margaret of Flanders.\n\nLife\nShe was engaged to Amadeus after the death of her father. The marriage was arranged when Savoy joined Brabant in an alliance with France against England. A Papal dispensation was obtained in October 1297. The wedding took place at the Ch\u00e2teau de Chamb\u00e9ry in 1298. \nAs countess of Savoy, Marie of Brabant appears to have brought with her a certain cultural influence from Brabant, and brought with her several artisans which influenced the court of Savoy, such as her tailor Colin de Brabant. The marriage resulted in close ties between Savoy and Brabant, and gave Brabant closer access to Italy. Marie appears to have had some influence at court, playing a role as diplomat and political adviser.In 1308, her brother-in-law was elected King in Germany. When her sister and brother-in-law travelled to Italy in 1310, they visited Maria at the court of Savoy in Geneva on their way to Rome. \nIn 1323, she became a widow. Her spouse was succeeded by Maria's stepson. The exact date of her death is unknown.\n\nIssue\nMaria of Savoy\nCatherine of Savoy, d. 1336, married to Leopold I (duke of Austria and Styria)\nAnna of Savoy, d. 1359, married to Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos\nBeatrice of Savoy (1310\u20131331), married in 1327 to Henry VI, Duke of Carinthia, count of Tirol\nPassage 6:\nHubba bint Hulail\nHubba bint Hulail (Arabic: \u062d\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u062a \u0647\u0644\u064a\u0644) was the grandmother of Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf, thus the great-great-great-grandmother of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nBiography\nHubbah was the daughter of Hulail ibn Hubshiyyah ibn Salul ibn Ka\u2019b ibn Amr al-Khuza\u2019i of Banu Khuza'a who was the trustee and guardian of the Ka\u2018bah (Arabic: \u0643\u064e\u0640\u0639\u0652\u0640\u0628\u064e\u0640\u0629, 'Cube'). She married Qusai ibn Kilab and after her father died, the keys of the Kaaba were committed to her. Qusai, according to Hulail's will, had the trusteeship of the Kaaba after him.\nHubbah never gave up ambitious hopes for the line of her favourite son Abd Manaf. Her two favourite grandsons were the twin sons Amr and Abd Shams, of \u2018\u0100tikah bint Murrah. Hubbah hoped that the opportunities missed by Abd Manaf would be made up for in these grandsons, especially Amr, who seemed much more suitable for the role than any of the sons of Abd al-Dar. He was dear to the \u2018ayn (Arabic: \u0639\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0646, eye) of his grandmother Hubbah.\n\nFamily\nQusai ibn Kilab had four sons by Hubbah: Abd-al-Dar ibn Qusai dedicated to his house, Abdu\u2019l Qusayy dedicated to himself, Abd-al-Uzza ibn Qusai to his goddess (Al-\u2018Uzz\u00e1) and Abd Manaf ibn Qusai to the idol revered by Hubbah. They also had two daughters, Takhmur and Barrah. Abd Manaf's real name was 'Mughirah', and he also had the nickname 'al-Qamar' (the Moon) because he was handsome.\nHubbah was related to Muhammad in more than one way. Firstly, she was the great-great-grandmother of his father Abdullah. She was also the great-grandmother of Umm Habib and Abdul-Uzza, respectively the maternal grandmother and grandfather of Muhammad's mother Aminah.\n\nFamily tree\n* indicates that the marriage order is disputed\nNote that direct lineage is marked in bold.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nList of notable Hijazis\nPassage 7:\nMargaret of France, Queen of England\nMargaret of France (c.\u20091279 \u2013 14 February 1318) was Queen of England as the second wife of King Edward I. She was a daughter of Philip III of France and Maria of Brabant.\n\nChildhood\nMargaret was the daughter of King Philip III of France and his second wife, Maria of Brabant. Margaret was only six years old when her father died. She grew up under guidance of her mother, and also of Queen Joan I of Navarre, the wife of her half-brother, King Philip IV.\n\nMarriage negotiations\nThe death of his beloved first wife, Eleanor of Castile, in 1290, left King Edward I of England grief-stricken. He was at the time at war with France and Scotland. He and Eleanor had only one surviving son, Edward, and so the king was anxious to remarry to have more sons. In summer of 1291, Edward betrothed his son to Blanche, half-sister to Margaret and Philip IV, in order to achieve peace with France. However, having been told of Blanche's renowned beauty, Edward decided to have his son's bride for his own and sent emissaries to France. Philip IV agreed to have Blanche marry Edward on the conditions that a truce would be concluded between the two countries, and that Edward would give up the province of Gascony.\nEdward agreed, and sent his brother Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, to fetch the new bride. Edward had been deceived, for Blanche was to be married to Rudolph, the eldest son of King Albert I of Germany. Instead, Philip IV offered her younger sister Margaret to marry Edward (then 55). Upon hearing this, Edward declared war on France, refusing to marry Margaret. After five years, a truce was agreed upon under the influence of Pope Boniface VIII. A series of treaties in the first half of 1299 provided terms for a double marriage: Edward I would marry Margaret and his son would marry Isabella, Philip IV's only surviving daughter. Additionally, the English monarchy would regain the key territory of Guyenne and receive \u00a315,000 owed to Margaret as well as the return of Eleanor of Castile's lands in Ponthieu and Montreuil as a dower first for Margaret and then Isabella.\n\nQueenship\nEdward was then 60 years old, at least 40 years older than his bride. The wedding took place at Canterbury on 10 September 1299. Margaret was never crowned due to financial constraints, being the first uncrowned queen since the Conquest. This in no way lessened her dignity as the king's wife, however, for she used the royal title in her letters and documents, and appeared publicly wearing a crown even though she had not received one during a formal rite of investiture.Edward soon returned to the Scottish border to continue his campaigns and left Margaret in London, but she had become pregnant quickly after the wedding. After several months, bored and lonely, the young queen decided to join her husband. Nothing could have pleased the king more, for Margaret's actions reminded him of his first wife Eleanor, who had had two of her sixteen children abroad. In less than a year Margaret gave birth to a son, Thomas, who was named after Thomas Becket, since she had prayed to him during her pregnancy. The next year she gave birth to another son, Edmund.\nMany who fell under the king's wrath were saved from too stern a punishment by the queen's influence over her husband, and the statement, Pardoned solely on the intercession of our dearest consort, queen Margaret of England, appears. In 1305, the young queen acted as a mediator between her step-son and husband, reconciling the heir apparent to his aging father, and calming her husband's wrath. She and her stepson, who was only two years younger than she, also became fond of each other: he once made her a gift of an expensive ruby and gold ring, and she on one occasion rescued many of the prince's friends from the wrath of the king.\nMargaret favoured the Franciscan order and was a benefactress of a new foundation at Newgate. She employed the minstrel Guy de Psaltery and both she and her husband liked to play chess. The mismatched couple were blissfully happy. When her sister Blanche died in 1305, Edward ordered full court mourning to please his wife. He had realised the wife he had gained was \"a pearl of great price\" as Margaret was respected for her beauty, virtue, and piety. The same year Margaret gave birth to a girl, Eleanor, named in honour of Edward's first wife, a choice which surprised many, and showed Margaret's unjealous nature.\nIn 1307, when Edward went on summer campaign to Scotland, Margaret accompanied him. Edward died in Burgh by Sands.\n\nWidowhood\nMargaret never remarried after Edward's death in 1307, despite being only 26 when widowed. She was alleged to have stated that, \"when Edward died, all men died for me\".\nMargaret was not pleased when Edward II elevated Piers Gaveston to become Earl of Cornwall upon his father's death, since the title had been meant for one of her own sons. She attended the new king's wedding to her half-niece Isabella, and a silver casket was made with both their arms. After Isabella's coronation, Margaret retired to Marlborough Castle (which was by this time a dower house), but she stayed in touch with the new queen and with her half-brother Philip IV by letter during the confusing times leading up to Gaveston's death in 1312. Margaret, too, was a victim of Gaveston's influence over her stepson. Edward II gave several of her dower lands to the favourite, including Berkhamsted Castle. In May 1308, an anonymous informer reported that Margaret had provided \u00a340,000 along with Philip IV to support the English barons against Gaveston. Due to this action, Gaveston was briefly exiled and Margaret remained fairly unmolested by the upstart until his death in June 1312.\nShe was present at the birth of Edward III in November 1312.\nOn 14 February 1318 she died in her castle at Marlborough. Dressed in a Franciscan habit, she was buried at Christ Church Greyfriars in London, a church she had generously endowed. Her tomb was destroyed during the Reformation.\n\nIssue\nIn all, Margaret gave birth to three children:\nThomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk (1 June 1300 \u2013 4 August 1338)\nEdmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent (5 August 1301 \u2013 19 March 1330)\nEleanor (4 May 1306 \u2013 1311) Died at Amesbury Abbey, buried at Beaulieu Abbey.\n\nGenealogical table\nPassage 8:\nHenry III, Duke of Brabant\nHenry III of Brabant (c. 1230 \u2013 February 28, 1261, Leuven) was Duke of Brabant between 1248 and his death. He was the son of Henry II of Brabant and Marie of Hohenstaufen. He was also a trouv\u00e8re.\nThe disputed territory of Lothier, the former Duchy of Lower Lorraine, was assigned to him by the King Alfonso X of Castile, a claimant to the German throne. Alfonso also appointed him imperial vicar to advance his claims on the Holy Roman Empire.\nIn 1251, he married Adelaide of Burgundy (c. 1233 \u2013 October 23, 1273), daughter of Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy and Yolande de Dreux, by whom he had four children:\n\nHenry IV, Duke of Brabant (c. 1251 \u2013 aft. 1272) Mentally disabled, and made to abdicate in favor of his brother John on 24 May 1267.\nJohn I, Duke of Brabant (1253\u20131294) Married first to Marguerite of France, daughter of King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and his wife Margaret of Provence, and later to Margaret of Flanders, daughter of Guy, Count of Flanders and his first wife Mathilda of B\u00e9thune.\nGodfrey of Brabant, Lord of Aarschot (d.

He died two days later. His wife Adelaide, acting as regent since Henry IV was incapable of ruling, never enforced this policy laid out in the will, and the Jews were able to stay.\n\nSee also\nDukes of Brabant family tree\nPassage 9:\nMarie of Brabant, Queen of France\nMarie of Brabant (13 May 1254 \u2013 12 January 1322) was Queen of France from 1274 until 1285 as the second wife of King Philip III. Born in Leuven, Brabant, she was a daughter of Henry III, Duke of Brabant, and Adelaide of Burgundy.\n\nQueen\nMarie married the widowed Philip III of France on 21 August 1274. His first wife, Isabella of Aragon, had already given birth to three surviving sons: Louis, Philip and Charles.\nPhilip was under the strong influence of his mother, Margaret of Provence, and his minion, surgeon and chamberlain (Chambellan) Pierre de la Broce. Not being French, Marie stood out at the French court. In 1276, Marie's stepson Louis died under suspicious circumstances. Marie was suspected of ordering him to be poisoned. La Broce, who was also suspected, was imprisoned and later executed for the murder.\n\nQueen dowager\nAfter the death of Philip III in 1285, Marie lost some of her political influence, and dedicated her life to their three children: Louis (May 1276 \u2013 19 May 1319), Blanche (1278 \u2013 19 March 1305) and Margaret (died in 1318). Her stepson Philip IV was crowned king of France on 6 January 1286 in Reims.\nTogether with Joan I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois, she negotiated peace in 1294 between England and France with Edmund Crouchback, the younger brother of Edward I of England.Marie lived through Philip IV's reign and she outlived her children. She died in 1322, aged 67, in the monastery at Les Mureaux, near Meulan, where she had withdrawn to in 1316. Marie was not buried in the royal necropolis of Basilica of Saint-Denis, but in the Cordeliers Convent, in Paris. Destroyed in a fire in 1580, the church was rebuilt in the following years.\n\nSee also\nMarie of Brabant (disambiguation)\n\nNotes\nSources\nBradbury, Jim (2007).

{"context":"Introduction\nEmotion detection has long been a topic of interest to scholars in natural language processing (NLP) domain. Researchers aim to recognize the emotion behind the text and distribute similar ones into the same group. Establishing an emotion classifier can not only understand each user's feeling but also be extended to various application, for example, the motivation behind a user's interests BIBREF0. Based on releasing of large text corpus on social media and the emotion categories proposed by BIBREF1, BIBREF2, numerous models have provided and achieved fabulous precision so far. For example, DeepMoji BIBREF3 which utilized transfer learning concept to enhance emotions and sarcasm understanding behind the target sentence. CARER BIBREF4 learned contextualized affect representations to make itself more sensitive to rare words and the scenario behind the texts.\nAs methods become mature, text-based emotion detecting applications can be extended from a single utterance to a dialogue contributed by a series of utterances. Table TABREF2 illustrates the difference between single utterance and dialogue emotion recognition. The same utterances in Table TABREF2, even the same person said the same sentence, the emotion it convey may be various, which may depend on different background of the conversation, tone of speaking or personality. Therefore, for emotion detection, the information from preceding utterances in a conversation is relatively critical.\nIn SocialNLP 2019 EmotionX, the challenge is to recognize emotions for all utterances in EmotionLines dataset, a dataset consists of dialogues. According to the needs for considering context at the same time, we develop two classification models, inspired by bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) BIBREF5, FriendsBERT and ChatBERT. In this paper, we introduce our approaches including causal utterance modeling, model pre-training, and fine-turning.\nDataset\nEmotionLines BIBREF6 is a dialogue dataset composed of two subsets, Friends and EmotionPush, according to the source of the dialogues. The former comes from the scripts of the Friends TV sitcom. The other is made up of Facebook messenger chats. Each subset includes $1,000$ English dialogues, and each dialogue can be further divided into a few consecutive utterances. All the utterances are annotated by five annotators on a crowd-sourcing platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk), and the labeling work is only based on the textual content. Annotator votes for one of the seven emotions, namely Ekman\u2019s six basic emotions BIBREF1, plus the neutral. If none of the emotion gets more than three votes, the utterance will be marked as \u201cnon-neutral\u201d.\nFor the datasets, there are properties worth additional mentioning. Although Friends and EmotionPush share the same data format, they are quite different in nature. Friends is a speech-based dataset which is annotated dialogues from the TV sitcom. It means most of the utterances are generated by the a few main characters. The personality of a character often affects the way of speaking, and therefore \u201cwho is the speaker\" might provide extra clues for emotion prediction. In contrast, EmotionPush does not have this trait due to the anonymous mechanism. In addition, features such as typo, hyperlink, and emoji that only appear in chat-based data will need some domain-specific techniques to process.\nIncidentally, the objective of the challenge is to predict the emotion for each utterance. Just, according to EmotionX 2019 specification, there are only four emotions be selected as our label candidates, which are Joy, Sadness, Anger, and Neutral. These emotions will be considered during performance evaluation. The technical detail will also be introduced and discussed in following Section SECREF13 and Section SECREF26.\nModel Description\nFor this challenge, we adapt BERT which is proposed by BIBREF5 to help understand the context at the same time. Technically, BERT, designed on end-to-end architecture, is a deep pre-trained transformer encoder that dynamically provides language representation and BERT already achieved multiple state-of-the-art results on GLUE benchmark BIBREF7 and many tasks. A quick recap for BERT's architecture and its pre-training tasks will be illustrated in the following subsections.\nModel Description ::: Model Architecture\nBERT, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, consists of several transformer encoder layers that enable the model to extract very deep language features on both token-level and sentence-level. Each transformer encoder contains multi-head self-attention layers that provide ability to learn multiple attention feature of each word from their bidirectional context. The transformer and its self-attention mechanism are proposed by BIBREF8. This self-attention mechanism can be interpreted as a key-value mapping given query. By given the embedding vector for token input, the query ($Q$), key ($K$) and value ($V$) are produced by the projection from each three parameter matrices where $W^Q \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{{\\rm model}} \\times d_{k}}, W^K \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model} \\times d_{k}}$ and $W^V \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model} \\times d_{v}}$. The self-attention BIBREF8 is formally represented as:\nThe $ d_k = d_v = d_{\\rm model} = 1024$ in BERT large version and 768 in BERT base version. Once model can extract attention feature, we can extend one self-attention into multi-head self-attention, this extension makes sub-space features can be extracted in same time by this multi-head configuration. Overall, the multi-attention mechanism is adopt for each transformer encoder, and several of encoder layer will be stacked together to form a deep transformer encoder.\nFor the model input, BERT allow us take one sentence as input sequence or two sentences together as one input sequence, and the maximum length of input sequence is 512. The way that BERT was designed is for giving model the sentence-level and token-level understanding. In two sentences case, a special token ([SEP]) will be inserted between two sentences. In addition, the first input token is also a special token ([CLS]), and its corresponding ouput will be vector place for classification during fine-tuning. The outputs of the last encoder layer corresponding to each input token can be treated as word representations for each token, and the word representation of the first token ([CLS]) will be consider as classification (output) representation for further fine-tuning tasks. In BERT, this vector is denoted as $C \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model}} $, and a classification layer is denoted as $ W \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K \\times d_{\\rm model}}$, where $K$ is number of classification labels. Finally, the prediction $P$ of BERT is represented as $P = {\\rm softmax}(CW^T)$.\nModel Description ::: Pre-training Tasks\nIn pre-training, intead of using unidirectional language models, BERT developed two pre-training tasks: (1) Masked LM (cloze test) and (2) Next Sentence Prediction. At the first pre-training task, bidirectional language modeling can be done at this cloze-like pre-training. In detail, 15% tokens of input sequence will be masked at random and model need to predict those masked tokens. The encoder will try to learn contextual representations from every given tokens due to masking tokens at random. Model will not know which part of the input is going to be masked, so that the information of each masked tokens should be inferred by remaining tokens. At Next Sentence Prediction, two sentences concatenated together will be considered as model input. In order to give model a good nature language understanding, knowing relationship between sentence is one of important abilities. When generating input sequences, 50% of time the sentence B is actually followed by sentence A, and rest 50% of the time the sentence B will be picked randomly from dataset, and model need to predict if the sentence B is next sentence of sentence A. That is, the attention information will be shared between sentences. Such sentence-level understanding may have difficulties to be learned at first pre-training task (Masked LM), therefore, the pre-training task (NSP) is developed as second training goal to capture the cross sentence relationship.\nIn this competition, limited by the size of dataset and the challenge in contextual emotion recognition, we consider BERT with both two pre-training tasks can give a good starting point to extract emotion changing during dialogue-like conversation. Especially the second pre-training task, it might be more important for dialogue-like conversation where the emotion may various by the context of continuous utterances. That is, given a set of continues conversations, the emotion of current utterance might be influenced by previous utterance. By this assumption and with supporting from the experiment results of BERT, we can take sentence A as one-sentence context and consider sentence B as the target sentence for emotion prediction. The detail will be described in Section SECREF4.\nMethodology\nThe main goal of the present work is to predict the emotion of utterance within the dialogue. Following are four major difficulties we concern about:\nThe emotion of the utterances depends not only on the text but also on the interaction happened earlier.\nThe source of the two datasets are different. Friends is speech-based dialogues and EmotionPush is chat-based dialogues. It makes datasets possess different characteristics.\nThere are only $1,000$ dialogues in both training datasets which are not large enough for the stability of training a complex neural-based model.\nThe prediction targets (emotion labels) are highly unbalanced.\nThe proposed approach is summarized in Figure FIGREF3, which aims to overcome these challenges. The framework could be separated into three steps and described as follow:\nMethodology ::: Causal Utterance Modeling\nGiven a dialogue $D^{(i)}$ which includes sequence of utterances denoted as $D^{(i)}=(u^{(i)}_{1}, u^{(i)}_{2}, ..., u^{(i)}_{n})$, where $i$ is the index in dataset and $n$ is the number of utterances in the given dialogue. In order to conserve the emotional information of both utterance and conversation, we rearrange each two consecutive utterances $u_{t}, u_{t-1}$ into a single sentence representation $x_{t}$ as\nThe corresponding sentence representation corpus $X^{(i)}$ are denoted as $X^{(i)}=(x^{(i)}_{1}, x^{(i)}_{2}, ..., x^{(i)}_{n})$. Note that the first utterance within a conversation does not have its causal utterance (previous sentence), therefore, the causal utterance will be set as [None]. A practical example of sentence representation is shown in Table TABREF11.\nSince the characteristics of two datasets are not identical, we customize different causal utterance modeling strategies to refine the information in text.\nFor Friends, there are two specific properties. The first one is that most dialogues are surrounding with the six main characters, including Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. The utterance ratio of given by the six roles is up to $83.4\\%$. Second, the personal characteristics of the six characters are very clear. Each leading role has its own emotion undulated rule. To make use of these features, we introduce the personality tokenization which help learning the personality of the six characters. Personality tokenization concatenate the speaker and says tokens before the input utterance if the speaker is one of the six characters. The example is shown in Table TABREF12.\nFor EmotionPush, the text are informal chats which including like slang, acronym, typo, hyperlink, and emoji. Another characteristic is that the specific name entities are tokenized with random index. (e.g. \u201corganization_80\u201d, \u201cperson_01\u201d, and \u201ctime_12\u201d). We consider some of these informal text are related to expressing emotion such as repeated typing, purposed capitalization, and emoji (e.g. \u201c:D\u201d, \u201c:(\u201d, and \u201c<3\u201d)). Therefore, we keep most informal expressions but only process hyperlinks, empty utterance, and name entities by unifying the tokens.\nMethodology ::: Model Pre-training\nSince the size of both datasets are not large enough for complex neural-based model training as well as BERT model is only pre-train on formal text datasets, the issues of overfitting and domain bias are important considerations for design the pre-training process.\nTo avoid our model overfitting on the training data and increase the understanding of informal text, we adapted BERT and derived two models, namely FriendsBERT and ChatBERT, with different pre-training tasks before the formal training process for Friends and EmotionPush dataset, respectively. The pre-training strategies are described below.\nFor pre-training FriendsBERT, we collect the completed scripts of all ten seasons of Friends TV shows from emorynlp which includes 3,107 scenes within 61,309 utterances. All the utterances are followed the preprocessing methods mentions above to compose the corpus for Masked language model pre-training task. The consequent utterances in the same scenes are considered as the consequent sentences to pre-train the Next Sentence Prediction task. In the pre-training process, the training loss is the sum of the mean likelihood of two pre-train tasks.\nFor pre-training ChatBERT, we pre-train our model on the Twitter dataset, since the text and writing style on Twitter are close to the chat text where both may involved with many informal words or emoticons as well. The Twitter emotion dataset, 8 basic emotions from emotion wheel BIBREF1, was collected by twitter streaming API with specific emotion-related hashtags, such as #anger, #joy, #cry, #sad and etc. The hashtags in tweets are treated as emotion label for model fine-tuning. The tweets were fine-grined processing followed the rules in BIBREF9, BIBREF4, including duplicate tweets removing, the emotion hashtags must appearing in the last position of a tweet, and etc. The statis of tweets were summarized in Table TABREF17. Each tweet and corresponding emotion label composes an emotion classification dataset for pre-training.\nMethodology ::: Fine-tuning\nSince our emotion recognition task is treated as a sequence-level classification task, the model would be fine-tuned on the processed training data. Following the BERT construction, we take the first embedding vector which corresponds to the special token [CLS] from the final hidden state of the Transformer encoder. This vector represents the embedding vector of the corresponding conversation utterances which is denoted as $\\mathbf {C} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{H}$, where $H$ is the embedding size. A dense neural layer is treated as a classification layer which consists of parameters $\\mathbf {W} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K\\times H}$ and $\\mathbf {b} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K}$, where $K$ is the number of emotion class. The emotion prediction probabilities $\\mathbf {P} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K}$ are computed by a softmax activation function as\nAll the parameters in BERT and the classification layer would be fine-turned together to minimize the Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) loss function, as Equation (DISPLAY_FORM22), based on the ground truth emotion label $c$.\nIn order to tackle the problem of highly unbalanced emotion labels, we apply weighted balanced warming on NLL loss function, as Equation (DISPLAY_FORM23), in the first epoch of fine-tuning procedure.\nwhere $\\mathbf {w}$ are the weights of corresponding emotion label $c$ which are computed and normalize by the frequency as\nBy adding the weighted balanced warming on NLL loss, the model could learn to predict the minor emotions (e.g. anger and sadness) earlier and make the training process more stable. Since the major evaluation metrics micro F1-score is effect by the number of each label, we only apply the weighted balanced warming in first epoch to optimize the performance.\nExperiments\nSince the EmotionX challenge only provided the gold labels in training data, we pick the best performance model (weights) to predict the testing data. In this section, we present the experiment and evaluation results.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Setup\nThe EmotionX challenge consists of $1,000$ dialogues for both Friends and EmotionPush. In all of our experiments, each dataset is separated into top 800 dialogues for training and last 200 dialogues for validation. Since the EmotionX challenge considers only the four emotions (anger, joy, neutral, and sadness) in the evaluation stage, we ignore all the data point corresponding to other emotions directly. The details of emotions distribution are shown in Table TABREF18.\nThe hyperparameters and training setup of our models (FriendsBERT and ChatBERT) are shown in Table TABREF25. Some common and easily implemented methods are selected as the baselines embedding methods and classification models. The baseline embedding methods are including bag-of-words (BOW), term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and neural-based word embedding. The classification models are including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), TextCNN BIBREF10 with initial word embedding as GloVe BIBREF11, and our proposed model. All the experiment results are based on the best performances of validation results.\nExperiments ::: Performance\nThe experiment results of validation on Friends are shown in Table TABREF19. The proposed model and baselines are evaluated based on the Precision (P.), Recall (R.), and F1-measure (F1).\nFor the traditional baselines, namely BOW and TFIDF, we observe that they achieve surprising high F1 scores around $0.81$, however, the scores for Anger and Sadness are lower. This explains that traditional approaches tend to predict the labels with large sample size, such as Joy and Neutral, but fail to take of scarce samples even when an ensemble random forest classifier is adopted. In order to prevent the unbalanced learning, we choose the weighted loss mechanism for both TextCNN and causal modeling TextCNN (C-TextCNN), these models suffer less than the traditional baselines and achieve a slightly balance performance, where there are around 15% and 7% improvement on Anger and Sadness, respectively. We following adopt the casual utterance modeling to original TextCNN, mapping previous utterance as well as target utterance into model. The causal utterance modeling improve the C-TextCNN over TextCNN for 6%, 2% and 1% on Anger, Joy and overall F1 score. Motivated from these preliminary experiments, the proposed FriendsBERT also adopt the ideas of both weighted loss and causal utterance modeling. As compared to the original BERT, single sentence BERT (FriendsBERT-base-s), the proposed FriendsBERT-base improve 1% for Joy and overall F1, and 2% for Sadness. For the final validation performance, our proposed approach achieves the highest scores, which are $0.85$ and $0.86$ for FriendsBERT-base and FriendsBERT-large, respectively.\nOverall, the proposed FriendsBERT successfully captures the sentence-level context-awarded information and outperforms all the baselines, which not only achieves high performance on large sample labels, but also on small sample labels. The similar settings are also adapted to EmotionPush dataset for the final evaluation.\nExperiments ::: Evaluation Results\nThe testing dataset consists of 240 dialogues including $3,296$ and $3,536$ utterances in Friends and EmotionPush respectively. We re-train our FriendsBERT and ChatBERT with top 920 training dialogues and predict the evaluation results using the model performing the best validation results. The results are shown in Table TABREF29 and Table TABREF30. The present method achieves $81.5\\%$ and $88.5\\%$ micro F1-score on the testing dataset of Friends and EmotionPush, respectively.\nConclusion and Future work\nIn the present work, we propose FriendsBERT and ChatBERT for the multi-utterance emotion recognition task on EmotionLines dataset. The proposed models are adapted from BERT BIBREF5 with three main improvement during the model training procedure, which are the causal utterance modeling mechanism, specific model pre-training, and adapt weighted loss. The causal utterance modeling takes the advantages of the sentence-level context information during model inference. The specific model pre-training helps to against the bias in different text domain. The weighted loss avoids our model to only predict on large size sample. The effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed methods are demonstrated from the experiments.\nIn future work, we consider to include the conditional probabilistic constraint $P ({\\rm Emo}_{B} | \\hat{\\rm Emo}_{A})$. Model should predict the emotion based on a certain understanding about context emotions. This might be more reasonable for guiding model than just predicting emotion of ${\\rm Sentence}_B$ directly. In addition, due to the limitation of BERT input format, ambiguous number of input sentences is now becoming an important design requirement for our future work. Also, personality embedding development will be another future work of the emotion recognition. The personality embedding will be considered as sentence embedding injected into word embedding, and it seems this additional information can contribute some improvement potentially.","label":"longbench","length":4428,"title":"Introduction"}

The trio created, wrote for and performed in their eponymous television comedy show from 1970 until 1982, combining sketches and situation comedy.\n\nBeginnings\nThe three actors met each other while undergraduates at the University of Cambridge, where Brooke-Taylor (Pembroke) was a law student, Garden (Emmanuel) was studying medicine and Oddie (Pembroke) was reading English. Their contemporaries included Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle, who later became members of Monty Python, and with whom they became close friends. Brooke-Taylor and Cleese studied together and swapped lecture notes, for they were both law students, but at different colleges within the university. All three Goodies became members of the Cambridge University Footlights Club, with Brooke-Taylor becoming president in 1963, and Garden succeeding him as president in 1964.In 1965, Eric Idle succeeded Garden as Footlights Club president. Idle had initially become aware of the Footlights when he auditioned for a \"smoker concert\" at Pembroke College in front of Brooke-Taylor and Oddie.\n\nCareer before The Goodies\nBrooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie were cast members of the 1960s BBC radio comedy show I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, which also featured John Cleese, David Hatch and Jo Kendall, and lasted until 1973.  I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again resulted from the 1963 Cambridge University Footlights Club revue A Clump of Plinths. After having its title changed to Cambridge Circus, the revue went on to play in the West End in London, England, followed by a tour of New Zealand, then on Broadway in New York City (including an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show).\nThey also took part in various TV shows with other people, including Brooke-Taylor in At Last the 1948 Show (with Cleese, Chapman and Marty Feldman). Brooke-Taylor also took part in Marty (with Marty Feldman, John Junkin and Roland MacLeod). In 1968 Brooke-Taylor appeared with Cleese, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman in How to Irritate People. Garden and Oddie took part in Twice a Fortnight (with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Jonathan Lynn), before Brooke-Taylor, Garden, and Oddie worked on the late-1960s TV show Broaden Your Mind (of which only about ten minutes survives).\n\nThe Goodies television series\nThe original BBC television series ran from November 1970 to February 1980 on BBC 2, with 67 half-hour episodes and two forty-five-minute Christmas specials. The series was created by Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, and originally co-written by all three, with Oddie providing the music for the show. Later episodes were co-written by Garden and Oddie.\nIt was one of the first shows in the UK to use chroma key and one of the first to use stop-motion techniques in a live action format. Other effects include hand editing for repeated movement, mainly used to make animals \"talk\" or \"sing\", and play speed effects as used in the episode \"Kitten Kong\". In the series, the threesome travelled on, and frequently fell off, a three-seater bicycle known to them as a 'trandem'.In September 1978, the trio appeared in character in an episode of the BBC1 television game show Star Turn Challenge, presented by Bernard Cribbins, in which teams of celebrities competed in acting games. Their opponents were three members of the cast of The Liver Birds, Nerys Hughes, Elizabeth Estensen and Michael Angelis. They also presented the Christmas 1976 edition of Disney Time from the toy department of Selfridges store in London, broadcast on BBC1 on Boxing Day at 5.50 pm.\nThe Goodies never had a formal contract with the BBC, and when the BBC Light Entertainment budget for 1980 was exhausted by the production of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy TV series, the Goodies signed a contract with London Weekend Television (LWT) for ITV. However, after one half-hour Christmas special (\"Snow White 2\") in 1981, and a six-part series in early 1982, the series was cancelled. In later interviews the cast suggest the reasons were mainly economic, and that a typical Goodies sketch was more expensive than it appeared.\n\nDVD and VHS releases\nAwards and nominations\n\"The Goodies\" won the Silver Rose at the Festival Rose d'Or, held in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1972 for a special episode, based on the original 1971 Goodies' \"Kitten Kong\" episode, titled \"Kitten Kong: Montreux '72 Edition\". In the first episode of the next series, \"The New Office\", Tim Brooke-Taylor can be seen painting the trophy gold.\n\"The Goodies\" was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1972, losing to The Benny Hill Show.\"The Goodies\" won the Silver Rose in 1975 at the Festival Rose d'Or for their episode \"The Movies\".\"The Goodies\" was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1976, losing to The Two Ronnies.\n\nInternational releases and repeats of the TV series\nBritain\nUnlike many long-running BBC comedy series, The Goodies has not enjoyed extensive repeats on terrestrial television in the UK. In 1986, BBC2 broadcast the episode \"Kitten Kong\" during a week of programmes screened under the banner \"TV-50\", when the BBC celebrated 50 years of broadcasting. In the late 1980s the pan-European satellite-channel Super Channel broadcast a couple of episodes, and the short-lived Comedy Channel broadcast some of the later Goodies episodes in the early 1990s. Later UK Gold screened many of the earlier episodes, often with commercial timing cuts. The same episodes subsequently aired on UK Arena, also cut. When UK Arena became UK Drama, later UKTV Drama, The Goodies was dropped along with its other comedy and documentary shows.\nThe cast finally took matters into their own hands and arranged with Network Video for the release of a digitally-remastered 'best of' selection entitled The Goodies ... At Last on VHS and Region 0 DVD in April 2003. A second volume, The Goodies ... At Last a Second Helping was released on Region 2 in February 2005. Series 9 (including the Xmas special) was released on Region 2 as The Goodies \u2013 The Complete LWT Series on 26 March 2007 and a fourth volume The Goodies ... At Last Back for More, Again was released on region 2 in 2010 as well as a DVD box set containing all four volumes to celebrate 40 years of The Goodies.\nIn 2004, an episode of the BBC documentary series Comedy Connections was devoted to the Goodies. During Christmas that year, Channel 5 repeated the classic 1973 episode \"The Goodies and the Beanstalk\".  Christmas 2005 saw a 90-minute Goodies special, a documentary about the series, Return of the Goodies, broadcast on BBC Two.Early in 2006, a single episode (\"Winter Olympics\") was broadcast on BBC Two. In February 2007, the 1982 LWT series was repeated on pay-TV channel Paramount 2.\nIn December 2010, BBC Two showed selected late-night repeats of the BBC series, which ran nightly from 23 to 30 December. This apparent gesture followed years of campaigning by The Goodies that the shows had not been repeated like other BBC shows such as Dad's Army, Only Fools and Horses and Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. The episodes shown were: \"Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms\" \/ \"Earthanasia\" \/ \"The Goodies and the Beanstalk\" \/ \"Kitten Kong\" \/ \"Lighthouse Keeping Loonies\" \/ \"Saturday Night Grease\" \/ \"The Baddies\" (a.k.a. \"Double Trouble\") and \"The Stone Age\", although \"Scoutrageous\", \"Kung Fu Kapers\" and \"Scotland\" (a.k.a. \"Loch Ness Monster\") were originally billed as episodes 1, 2 and 7 of the repeat run. The episodes garnered good ratings given their time slot, and the first six episodes were taken from the BBC's own master tapes, rather than the digital remasters, the rights to which are currently owned by Network Video. \"The Baddies\" and \"The Stone Age\" have never been digitally remastered.\nOn Sunday 8 June 2014, during a 1970s weekend, BBC Two repeated the Montreux '72 Edition of \"Kitten Kong\" once again; however, this has been the only episode to be repeated twice, and no full series have been repeated since.\nIn September 2018, Network released a box set titled The Goodies: The Complete BBC Collection. This set contains every single episode from 1970-1980 (excepting the lost, original version of \"Kitten Kong\") and, as a bonus feature, a one-hour edit of the show \"An Audience with the Goodies\", hosted by Stewart Lee and filmed live at Leicester Square in June 2018.\nIn late September 2022 the TV channel 'That's TV' (numbered 183 on SKY TV listings and 65 on Freeview) started showing the BBC episodes, one episode every day, starting with series one episode one on 26th September at 21.40. Series 2 started airing at 21.45 on October 5th. Series 3 started airing at 21:40 on October 11th. Series 4 started airing at 21:30 on October 17th. Series 5 started airing at 21:30 on October 24th. Series 6 started airing at 21:30 on November 6th. Some episodes are being aired in poor quality and\/or black & White as the tapes were sadly wiped for reuse by the BBC in the 1970s. Although there is a message before each episode stating; 'This programme reflects the standards, language and attitudes of its time. Some viewers may find this content offensive', it seems that not all episodes are being aired - noticeably the 'Kitten Kong', 'Special Tax Edition' & \t'The Goodies Rule \u2013 O.K.?' specials, but also series 2 episodes 'Pollution', 'The Lost Tribe', 'Come Dancing', 'Gender Education, 'Charity Bounce' & 'The Baddies', series 3 episode 'Superstar', series 4 episodes 'The Goodies and the Beanstalk' & 'The Race', series 5 episodes 'Scatty Safari' & 'South Africa' were not aired, with no notice or reason given.\n\nAustralia\nIn Australia, the series has had continued popularity. It was especially popular when it was repeated through the 1970s and 1980s by the ABC. As the show was typically broadcast in the 25-minute 6:00 pm children's timeslot, portions often had to be cut. The 1981-82 LWT series was played once on the Seven Network in the early 1980s. The ABC screened the BBC episodes again in the early 1990s, but skipped several stories due to either inappropriate material for a children's timeslot, or a lack of colour prints at the time. The BBC episodes were then heavily edited to allow time for commercials when repeated on Network Ten in the 1990s, before moving to the pay television channel UK.TV during the late 1990s and early 2000s, where they were screened in full. ABC2  ran re-runs of the series, beginning in 2010.\nThree of the Goodies DVDs are available in Australia under different titles to the UK releases: The Goodies: 8 Delicious Episodes, The Goodies: A Tasty Second Helping and The Goodies: The Final Episodes, respectively. The Goodies' DVDs are also available in a boxed set with a commemorative booklet (The Goodies: The Tasty Box). This collection contains the same 16 episodes as the original two DVD releases but with additional material such as commentaries on several episodes and the original scripts of some episodes in PDF format. Picture quality has been greatly improved using digital restoration techniques and the episode \"Come Dancing\", which was originally thought to only have survived as a black-and-white film recording, is presented in colour from a 625-line low-band broadcast standard PAL VT recording, made for training purposes, which has had the low-level colour boosted. (The original Australian DVD release, The Goodies \u2013 A Tasty Second Helping (2 disc set), and The Goodies \u2013 A Second Helping: 4 tasty serves (1 Disc), featured the b\/w telerecording of this episode.)\n\nCanada\nIn Canada, the series was shown in on the CBC national broadcast network during the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the traditional \"after school\" time slot, later a Friday night 10 pm slot, and occasionally in a midnight slot. Several episodes were also shown on the CTV Television Network. In the mid-1970s it was shown on TVOntario on Saturday evenings, repeated on Thursday evenings, until it was replaced by Doctor Who in 1976.\n\nGermany\nIn Germany in 1972, German TV screened the 13-part variety show Engelbert and the Young Generation, a co-production between the BBC and German station ZDF in which The Goodies appeared in short 3-to-4-minute film sequences. The first six of these sequences were culled from the first and second series of The Goodies: \"Pets\" (from \"Kitten Kong\"), \"Pop Festival\" (from \"The Music Lovers\"), \"Keep Fit\" (from \"Commonwealth Games\"), \"Post Office\" (from \"Radio Goodies\"), \"Sleepwalking\" (from \"Snooze\") and \"Factory Farm\" (from \"Fresh Farm Foods\"); and there were seven new film sequences, \"Good Deed Day\", \"The Gym\", \"The Country Code\", \"Street Entertainers\", \"Plum Pudding\", \"Bodyguards\" and \"Pan's Grannies\" \u2013 these also featured intro sequences with host Engelbert Humperdinck visiting the Goodies at their office. The shows were dubbed into German and because the Goodies part of the shows was more visual than dialogue-based, it translated very well.\nFive of these new films were also cut together, with a new story involving The Goodies filling out their \"Tax Evasion\" form, as a special 25-minute Goodies compilation episode, \"A Collection of Goodies\", first broadcast on BBC1 at 8.15 pm on 24 September 1972, and produced by Jim Franklin. \"The Country Code\" and \"Bodyguards\" were not used.\n\nNew Zealand\nIn New Zealand, the series was originally shown in full by the NZBC (later TV One) during the 1970s and 1980s. Since then, it has been re-run on SKY Network Television's Comedy Central.\n\nSpain\nIn Spain, a couple of episodes of The Goodies were shown as part of a season of television-award-winning programmes (the Goodies were Montreux Festival winners) on TVE 2 entitled Festival TV in 1981.\n\nUnited States\nIn the US, the series was shown widely in syndication during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but has been little seen since. It was shown also on PBS stations, sometimes in tandem with Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nBooks\nGoodies books, written by the Goodies\nIn their heyday The Goodies also produced successful books:\n\nThe Goodies File \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, Sphere Books Ltd., London 1975.

In 1974\u201375, they chalked up five hit singles in twelve months: \"The Inbetweenies\", \"Black Pudding Bertha\", \"Nappy Love\" and \"The Funky Gibbon\" (all performed during the episode \"The Goodies \u2013 Almost Live\"), and \"Make a Daft Noise for Christmas\".\n\"The Funky Gibbon\" was their biggest hit, reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. The Goodies made an appearance on Top of the Pops with the song. They also performed it during the Amnesty International show A Poke in the Eye (with a Sharp Stick). \"The Funky Gibbon\" became a favourite in the United States on Dr. Demento's radio shows and reached number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975.\nThe New Goodies LP, which featured most of the hit singles, reached number 25 on the UK Albums Chart in 1975.\n\nGoodies Theme\nThree variations of the Goodies Theme were used on the opening titles for the 1970\u20131982 television series. Apart from the original Goodies Theme, used from 1970\u20131972 and released as a single, two other variations surfaced, one, with a contemporary feel from 1973\u20131974, sung by Bill and then the third and final theme for the rest of the series from 1975 onwards, again sung by Bill. This variation lasted for the rest of the TV series and also surfaced on later Goodies LPs and, eventually, singles.\n\nOther collaborations\nTim Brooke-Taylor was a writer\/performer on the television comedy series At Last the 1948 Show (which also included John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman in the cast), in which Eric Idle and Bill Oddie guest-starred in some of the episodes.

Garden also appeared as a television interviewer in the series, in the episode titled \"On the Box\".\nBetween 1981 and 1983 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a science fiction sitcom called Astronauts for Central and ITV. The show was set in a British space station in the near future.\nGarden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show If I Ruled the World. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time The Goodies episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to refute this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more...it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\nIn 2004, Garden and Brooke-Taylor were co-presenters of Channel 4's daytime game show Beat the Nation, in which they indulged in usual game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. Oddie hosts a very successful series of nature programmes for the BBC.\n\nGoodies reunion shows\n2005 Australian reunion shows\nThe trio reunited in Australia for The Goodies (Still A) Live on Stage as part of Sydney's Big Laugh Comedy Festival in March 2005.

Scripted by Gareth Gwynn and John-Luke Roberts, along with Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, and recorded in front of a highly appreciative live audience, the cast comprised Tim, Bill (an indisposed Graeme was replaced at the last minute by the project's originator and producer, Barnaby Eaton-Jones), Joanna Lumley, Philip Pope, Jon Culshaw and Kate Harbour, with direction from Dirk Maggs. Graeme Garden's own description reads \u2018As Parliament falls apart and sinister dictators threaten the world, Tim, Graeme and Bill must save the day. They defeated Kitten Kong! They stuffed the Funky Gibbon! They invented Ecky Thump! Can they save Parliament as well? 52% say yes. 48% say no. But you just can't rely on statistics, can you?!\u2019 The audiobook, released by Audible on 9 October 2019, was intended to be the pilot for a forthcoming series of new episodes to be written and recorded in 2020; however, the project ended with Tim Brooke-Taylor\u2019s death from complications from COVID-19 on April 12 that year in Cookham, Berkshire, aged 79.\nIn January 2022 it was announced that a series of novellas based on the planned Audible episodes was set to be published by Chinbeard Books, commencing with \"Avengers Dissemble\", adapted by producer and writer Barnaby Eaton Jones, with a foreword by Joanna Lumley, and based on material co-devised with the Goodies. The first book is dedicated to Tim Brooke-Taylor, 2 years since his death from COVID-19 complications and published with the backing of Tim's family and the 2 remaining Goodies: Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, with a percentage of the royalties going to the charity Tim was President of for over 25 years \u2013 Thames Valley Adventure Playground.\n\nCultural influence\nThe Mighty Boosh was started when Julian Barratt asked Noel Fielding if he wanted to make a modern-day Goodies.The official Goodies fan club's (Goodies Rule-OK!) newsletter is called the Clarion & Globe. It was named after the newspaper in The Goodies' episode \"Fleet Street Goodies\" (a.k.a. \"Cunning Stunts\").During the 1970s, Cor!! comic, released by Fleetway publications, had a Goodies comics strip. When the comic later merged with Buster, the Goodies did not move across, although the TV show was still running.Australian rock band Spiderbait released a 1993 album and EP which contained a rocked-up fast cover version of the Goodies song \"Run\".Australian theatre company Shaolin Punk produced a short play titled \"A Record or an OBE\", written by Melbourne comedian and actor Ben McKenzie, and featuring Tim and Graeme as characters. Set in 1975, the two remaining Goodies struggle to carry on after Bill leaves the group to pursue a music career. The play premiered in the 2007 Melbourne Fringe Festival, where it was highly commended in the Comedy category. Later seasons were also performed for the Adelaide Fringe and Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2008.U.S. rock band The White Stripes named their 6th album Icky Thump in reference to The Goodies sketch \"The Battle of Ecky Thump\". The name was changed from \"Ecky Thump\" to \"Icky Thump\" to make the title more palatable to an American teenage audience.\n\nHonours\nAll three Goodies were awarded OBEs. Bill Oddie received his OBE in 2003 for wildlife conservation, while Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden received their OBEs in 2011 for services to light entertainment. The show often mocked OBEs: in particular, a running joke was that Tim desperately wanted to receive one.\n\nAwards\nAll three Goodies have been regular attendees at Slapstick Festival in Bristol, and in 2011 they were awarded the Aardman Slapstick Visual Comedy Legend Award at the festival for the significant contributions to the field of visual comedy they have made during their careers.\n\nViewer incidents\nOn 24 March 1975, Alex Mitchell, a 50-year-old bricklayer from King's Lynn, literally died laughing while watching an episode of The Goodies. According to his wife, who was a witness, Mitchell was unable to stop laughing whilst watching a sketch in the episode \"Kung Fu Kapers\" in which Tim Brooke-Taylor, dressed as a kilted Scotsman, used a set of bagpipes to defend himself from a black pudding-wielding Bill Oddie (master of the ancient Lancastrian martial art \"Ecky-Thump\") in a demonstration of the Scottish martial art of \"Hoots-Toot-ochaye\". After twenty-five minutes of continuous laughter Mitchell finally slumped on the settee and died from heart failure. His widow later sent the Goodies a letter thanking them for making Mitchell's final moments so pleasant. In 2012, Mitchell's granddaughter was diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome after suffering cardiac arrest. Because this condition is genetic, it is believed that Mitchell's heart failure was triggered by an undiagnosed case of LQTS.On 1 November 1977, Seema Bakewell, a 32-year-old housewife from Leicester, went into labour whilst laughing at a sketch in the Goodies episode \"Alternative Roots\". She refused to leave home for the hospital until the episode had finished.  Thirty years later, she visited the 2007 UK reunion tour with \"her baby, Ayesha, and the baby's husband\" and recounted the story to Graeme Garden.\n\nSee also\nList of The Goodies episodes\nThe Goodies discography\nThe Goodies videography\nPassage 3:\nBook of Ways\nBook of Ways, the feeling of strings, is a one-in-a-kind double album of improvised music performed by Keith Jarrett on clavichord recorded in July 1986 and released by ECM Records in 1987.\n\nMaking of\nAs Jarrett stated in an interview with pianist Ted Rosenthal appeared in the Jan-Feb 1997 issue of \"Piano and Keyboard magazine\", \n\n\"That whole recording was done in one afternoon and everything was a first take and nothing was coming from any pre--ordained thing. I had no material.\" (..)\n\"I think Book of Ways is one of the recordings I wish more people would know. I think it has more of what I hear on it than a lot of things (I do) on piano because piano is piano. These two clavichords together made a different instrument. You could use vibrato on one of them and not the other one, and play unison. I was playing two at the same time as you probably could tell\"\n\nIn the original notes for the compilation album \"Keith Jarrett Selected Recordings\", with music selected by Mr. Jarrett himself, he states that:\n\nA Note on \"Book of ways\": To my knowledge, this recording is unique in several ways. We had three clavichords in the studio, two of which were angled together so that I could play them both simultaneously, and the third off to the side. Also we miked the instruments very closely so that the full range of dynamics could be used (clavichords are very quiet and cannot be heard more than a few feet away). The two CDs were made on an off day between concerts with my Trio, and no material was organized beforehand. Everything was spontaneous. The recording was done in four hours.\n\nReception\nFor his 2002 \"Keith Jarrett Selected Recordings\" album review (which contains \"Book of Ways\" #12, #14 and #18), Peter Marsh at BBC calls it \"extraordinary\" and that \"the results echo back to Baroque's original role as context for improvisation and simultaneously (through the use of unconventional techniques) rockets it forward a few hundred years.\"The Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 3 stars, noting, \"Jarrett occasionally tries to stretch the instrument's limited possibilities, hammering percussively on the close-miked strings. Yet for the most part, Jarrett reins in his world-class technique in order to make unpretentiously minimal music on this ancient keyboard. Some of it sounds like folk music, some like new age contemplation, there are convincing neo-baroque musings, and a few of these untitled though numbered selections kick into a higher gear. Sometimes this music is charming; a lot of the time, it gets wearisome. But hey, they also laughed when Keith started putting out massive sets of solo piano...\"\n\nTrack listing\nAll music by Keith JarrettDisc One:\n\n\"Book of Ways 1\" - 9:08\n\"Book of Ways 2\" - 3:41\n\"Book of Ways 3\" - 4:03\n\"Book of Ways 4\" - 4:54\n\"Book of Ways 5\" - 2:58\n\"Book of Ways 6\" - 4:09\n\"Book of Ways 7\" - 3:36\n\"Book of Ways 8\" - 5:35\n\"Book of Ways 9\" - 5:02\n\"Book of Ways 10\" - 3:35Disc Two:  \n\n\"Book of Ways 11\" - 6:16\n\"Book of Ways 12\" - 4:08\n\"Book of Ways 13\" - 4:38\n\"Book of Ways 14\" - 7:13\n\"Book of Ways 15\" - 5:48\n\"Book of Ways 16\" - 7:37\n\"Book of Ways 17\" - 3:56\n\"Book of Ways 18\" - 7:16\n\"Book of Ways 19\" - 5:38\n\nPersonnel\nKeith Jarrett \u2013 clavichordProduction\n\nManfred Eicher - producer\nMartin Wieland - recording engineer\nKishin Shinoyama - photo\nBarbara Wojirsch - cover design and layout\nPassage 4:\nThe Stars and Stripes Forever\n\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" is a patriotic American march written and composed by John Philip Sousa in 1896. By a 1987 act of the U.S. Congress, it is the official National March of the United States of America.\n\nHistory\nIn his 1928 autobiography, Marching Along, Sousa wrote that he composed the march on Christmas Day, 1896. He was on board an ocean liner on his way home from a vacation with his wife in Europe and had just learned of the recent death of David Blakely, the manager of the Sousa Band. He composed the march in his head and committed the notes to paper on arrival in the United States. It was first performed at Willow Grove Park, just outside Philadelphia, on May 14, 1897, and was immediately greeted with enthusiasm. Following an Act of Congress in 1987, it was officially adopted as the national march of the United States of America.Historically, in show business and particularly in theater and the circus, this piece is called \"the Disaster March\". In the early 20th century, when it was common for theaters and circuses to have house bands, this march was a traditional code signaling a life-threatening emergency. It subtly notified personnel of emergency situations and ideally allowed them to organize the audience's exit without causing the chaos and panic that an overt declaration might. Except for impending disaster, circus bands never played the tune under any circumstances. One memorable example of its use was during the Hartford circus fire of July 6, 1944. At least 168 people were killed, though some estimates are much higher.\n\nMusic\n\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" follows the standard U.S. military march form\u2014of repeated phrasing of different melodies performed in sections called strains: a Sousa legacy. Performances vary according to the arrangements of individual band directors or orchestrators, especially regarding tempo and the number and sequence of strains employed.\n\nAnalysis\nThe march begins with a four-bar introduction, following with the first strain, which is repeated; then the second strain, which is also repeated; and sometimes both are repeated again if (the band is) marching in parade (or the breakstrain may be interjected and repeated). Now follows the dominant woodwinds in the first run of the famous Trio strain\u2014familiar to many for the nonsense lyrics: \"Be kind to your web-footed friends...\"\u2014which repeats, and later repeats again as the piccolos obligato. (Here, in some performances, Sousa's patriotic lyrics may be sung in a choral overlay.) Then follows the breakstrain, the final strain, and the breakstrain repeated. The final repeats of the Trio (the Grandioso) render the famous obligato of the piccolo players\u2014joined to a subdued but prominent countermelody by the brass section, then bringing everything to a close with once-more repeats of the grand finale.\nSousa explained to the press that the three themes of the final trio were intended to represent the three regions of the United States. The broad melody, or main theme, portrays the North. The South is represented by the famous piccolo obligato, and the West by the bold countermelody of the trombones. The three come together in the climax, representing the Union itself.\n\nInstrumentation\nThis is scored for an orchestra consisting of two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, snare drum, glockenspiel, and strings.\n\nLyrics\nSousa's lyrics\nSousa wrote lyrics to the piece, although they are not as familiar as the music itself. A typical pairing of Sousa's lyrics with various sections of the march\u2014here the First strain and the Grandioso strain\u2014is noted in the colored bars.\n\nTidmarsh's additional lyrics\nIn 1942 the John Church Company published a four-part choral version of the march with a piano arrangement by Elmer Arthur Tidmarsh. This arrangement has additional lyrics written by Tidmarsh for the Breakstrain section of the march.\n\nParody lyrics\nThe exact origin of the parody is unclear, but versions of it were being quoted as early as the 1930s on college campuses, and during the 1940s, where it was sung for entertainment by soldiers at the USO. Some newspapers of that time referred to it as the \"Duck Song.\" In 1954, Charles Grean and Joan Javits composed \"Crazy Mixed Up Song\", using the theme from \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\", with lyrics beginning \"Be kind to your web-footed friends\". It was made somewhat popular by Peter Lind Hayes & Mary Healy in that year. In the early 1960s, it reached a wider audience as a part of Mitch Miller's nationally syndicated sing-along show, Sing Along with Mitch. This version has perhaps the best known lyrics, which were used to end every show:\n\nThe last two lines were later used for the theme song of the 1985 television series The Berenstain Bears, but with the lyrics changed to:\n\nLater versions of \"Be kind to your web-footed friends\" extended the lyrics of the second verse. One popular version goes like this:\n\nAnd the song repeats itself ad infinitum, getting higher in tone each repeat until the singer is ready for the final as per Mitch Miller:\n\n\"Well, you're right!\" may be substituted for \"Well, it is!\".\nAnother version goes like this:\n\nThe blank may be filled with appropriate adjectives like \"low\", \"high\", \"silly\", \"fast\", etc., until ready for the finale, when the singer may end with \"Well, it is!\" as did Mitch Miller.\n\nSoccer chants\n\"Here We Go\", the British soccer chant, consists of the words \"here we go\" continuously repeated to the tune of The Stars and Stripes Forever. It was described by Auberon Waugh as the national anthem of the working classes. It was the basis of Everton F.C.'s official song for the 1984 FA Cup Final. The tune has been repurposed for many other, similarly repetitive, football chants.\n\nVariations and notable uses\n\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" is featured in many U.S. musical performances and pop culture:\n\nThere are several orchestral transcriptions of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\", including one by conductor Leopold Stokowski and one by Keith Brion and Loras Schissel. There was also an orchestral arrangement of the march by Carl Davis and David Cullen for the album Carl Conducts...Classical Festival Favourites. Orchestral versions are typically transposed one-half step lower than the original band version, to put the march in a key that is more familiar to string players.\nThe tune is widely used by soccer fans, with the trio\/grandioso section sung with the words \"Here We Go\". The supporters of Spanish side Valencia CF used to sing it with the words \"Xe que b\u00f3!\" which means something like \"Oh! How good\" in Valencian, and those words have become a symbol for the team. Another version uses the word cheerio repeatedly, normally sung to players or coaches when they have been sent off or occasionally when an underdog has ended its opponent's cup campaign. Finally, certain clubs such as Forest Green or Sunderland use the chant just using the club name; this only works if the name has three syllables. A nickname can instead be used for the chant, such as Gateshead fans chanting \"Tynesiders\".\nIn the 1933 film Duck Soup, Harpo Marx, playing Pinky, a spy infiltrating a house in the middle of the night, attempts to open what he believes to be a safe, but turns out to be a large radio, which loudly begins playing \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" when he turns the knob. Pinky spends the next several moments futilely (and loudly) trying to quell the noise before throwing the radio out a nearby window.\nThe march was used in the 1939 cartoon Officer Duck, after Donald Duck successfully subdues Tiny Tom, played by Pete. It is played by a marching band of police officers who further advance Tom's arrest. On the highest note of the brass, Donald kicks Tom on his rear end.\nClassic Popeye the Sailor cartoons by Fleischer Studios make frequent use of the tune in the music score accompanying the climactic fight between Popeye and the villain starting with the moment Popeye gets a spinach power boost.\nParts of the tune feature in two Laurel and Hardy short films, The Chimp and Come Clean.\nIn show business, as said before, particularly theater and the circus, this piece is called \"the Disaster March\". It is a traditional code signaling a life-threatening emergency. This helps theater personnel to handle events and organize the audience's exit without panic. Circus bands never play it under any other circumstances. One memorable example of its use was at the Hartford Circus Fire in July 1944, in which at least 160 people were killed.\nA 1952 biographical film, Stars and Stripes Forever, gives an account of the composer's life and music.\nRussian-American pianist Vladimir Horowitz wrote a famous transcription of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" for solo piano to celebrate his becoming an American citizen. In an interview, Horowitz opined that the march, being a military march, is meant to be played at a walking tempo. He complained that many conductors played the piece too fast, resulting in music that is \"hackneyed\".\nTimmy Mallett was fond of chanting \"Wacaday, Wacaday, Wacaday\" to the tune in children's TV show Wacaday, often getting child guests to do the same.\nIn \"Evolution\", the first episode of the third season of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, a malfunction in the ship's systems causes the main computer to play Sousa's march on all channels throughout the ship. The episode was first aired on September 25, 1989.\nThe song is usually played for the President of the United States after he gives a speech at a public forum, event, or ceremony, whereas \"Hail to the Chief\" is played when the President is introduced.\nThe tune of the song appears in the 1970 animated TV special adaptation of Horton Hears a Who! by Dr. Seuss, used as the melody for the song Be Kind To Your Small Person Friends.\nIn 1981, fingerstyle guitarist Guy Van Duser made an arrangement of the march for guitar. It was later performed by guitarists such as Chet Atkins, Rick Foster and Doug Smith.\nThe march was adapted for the theme song to The Berenstain Bears 1985 cartoon.\nAn 8-bit version of the song is used in the MS-DOS and Commodore 64 versions of Wheel of Fortune when solving a puzzle correctly.\nThe student band Strindens Promenade Orchester in Trondheim, Norway, has the world record in \"speed playing\" of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" (absolutely all notes must be played). The band calls their speedy rendering of the march \"Stars and Stribes\", and performs the march at all solemn occasions at the Trondheim Student Society. Set during the fall term of 1999, the record time is 50.9 seconds (nominal time is 3 minutes 50 seconds). For this, the band is noted in the Norwegian edition of the Guinness Book of Records.\nThe march in a specific rendition is in the soundtrack of the video game Postal 2, where it's performed by the marching band.\nAmerican composer Robert W. Smith parodied Stars and Stripes Forever along with \"Jingle Bells\" with his composition \"Jingle Bells Forever\", published by Alfred Publishing Co.\nIn 2008, the Muppets performed a web version starring Sam the Eagle, Beaker, a clucking chicken, Bobo the Bear, The Swedish Chef, and Crazy Harry.\nThe video game Fallout 3 has the Stars and Stripes Forever as one of the songs on the Enclave Radio.\nIn 2009, Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman used this tune as a jingle in advertising character Ruff Ruffman's \"RuffMeal\" in the episode \"The RuffMeal Needs More Roughage\".\nAt the conclusion of WWE's Extreme Rules pay-per-view in 2011, Stars and Stripes Forever played following John Cena announcing the death of Osama Bin Laden. It was also played during the January 5, 2015 episode of WWE Raw from Corpus Christi, Texas, also involving Cena, during the main event segment called John Cena Appreciation Night, where The Authority (Triple H and Stephanie McMahon) thanked Cena for (kayfabe) re-hiring them following the previous year's Survivor Series event's main event match, only to slander him and then (kayfabe) fire his teammates from that night, Dolph Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan. The Big Show, who was also Cena's teammate during the aforementioned match, was not fired since he turned his back on Cena during the match and then joined The Authority. Balloons and confetti then fell from the rafters as Cena and his teammates stood in the ring, dejected, as the song played.\nIn Argentina, a sensationalist news channel, Cr\u00f3nica TV, always uses the first 22 seconds of this march as a background music on reporting breaking news stories.\nThe Grateful Dead finished their 50th reunion concert on July 4, 2015 with fireworks accompanied by a recording of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\", in front of 70,000 people in Soldier Field in Chicago.\nIn 2022, a March Madness-themed commercial from Capital One featured the opening notes of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" being played by a marching band led by Charles Barkley, who claimed to represent a fictional university named \"Chuck U\". Samuel L. Jackson and Spike Lee are also featured in the commercial.\n\nSee also\nList of marches by John Philip Sousa\n\"You're a Grand Old Flag\"\nPassage 5:\nMy Way\n\"My Way\" is a song popularized in 1969 by Frank Sinatra set to the music of the French song \"Comme d'habitude\" composed by Jacques Revaux with lyrics by Gilles Thibaut and Claude Fran\u00e7ois and first performed in 1967 by Claude Fran\u00e7ois. Its English lyrics were written by Paul Anka and are unrelated to the original French song.  \nThe song was a success for a variety of performers including Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Sid Vicious. Sinatra's version of \"My Way\" spent 75 weeks in the UK Top 40, which is 3rd place all-time.\n\nBackground\nIn 1967, Jacques Revaux wrote a ballad named \"For Me\", with English lyrics about a couple falling out of love. According to Revaux, the demo was then sent to Petula Clark, Dalida, and Claude Fran\u00e7ois, to no avail. Revaux rejected a version by Herv\u00e9 Villard, the singer of the international hit Capri c'est fini and reworked the track into Comme d'habitude (\"As usual\") with the help of Claude Fran\u00e7ois. It was released in November 1967 and was at the top of the French pop chart for one week in February 1968.Paul Anka heard the French original, while on holiday in the south of France. He flew to Paris to negotiate the rights to the song. He acquired adaptation, recording, and publishing rights for the nominal but formal consideration of one dollar, subject to the provision that the melody's composers would retain their original share of royalty rights with respect to whatever versions Anka or his designates created or produced.  Some time later, Anka had a dinner in Florida with Frank Sinatra and \"a couple of Mob guys\" during which Sinatra said: \"I'm quitting the business. I'm sick of it; I'm getting the hell out.\"\nBack in New York, Anka re-wrote the original French song for Sinatra, subtly altering the melodic structure and changing the lyrics: At one o'clock in the morning, I sat down at an old IBM electric typewriter and said, 'If Frank were writing this, what would he say?' And I started, metaphorically, 'And now the end is near.' I read a lot of periodicals, and I noticed everything was 'my this' and 'my that'. We were in the 'me generation' and Frank became the guy for me to use to say that. I used words I would never use: 'I ate it up and spit it out.' But that's the way he talked. I used to be around steam rooms with the Rat Pack guys\u2014they liked to talk like Mob guys, even though they would have been scared of their own shadows. Anka finished the song at 5 in the morning: \"I called Frank up in Nevada\u2014he was at Caesars Palace \u2013 and said, 'I've got something really special for you.'\" Anka asserted: \"When my record company caught wind of it, they were very pissed that I didn't keep it for myself. I said, 'Hey, I can write it, but I'm not the guy to sing it.' It was for Frank, no one else.\"Despite this, Anka would record the song in 1969 very shortly after Sinatra's recording was released. Anka recorded it four other times as well: in 1996 (as a duet with Gabriel Byrne, performed in the movie Mad Dog Time); in 1998 in Spanish as \"A Mi Manera\" (duet with Julio Iglesias); in 2007 (as a duet with Jon Bon Jovi); and in 2013 (as a duet with Garou).On December 30, 1968, Frank Sinatra recorded his version of the song in one take, featuring session drummer Buddy Saltzman among the band.\n\"My Way\" was released in early 1969 on the My Way LP and as a single. It reached No. 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 2 on the Easy Listening chart in the US. In the UK, the single achieved a still unmatched record, becoming the recording with the most weeks inside the Top 40, spending 75 weeks from April 1969 to September 1971. It spent a further 49 weeks in the Top 75 but never bettered the No. 5 slot achieved upon its first chart run.Billboard said that the \"driving, lush and commercial Don Costa arrangement and production is an added plus to one of Sinatra's finest performances.\" Cash Box said that \"The powerful material is matched by a splendidly moving performance which is certain to win rave comments from programmers with teen and adult audiences.\"Although this work became Frank Sinatra's signature song, his daughter Tina says the singer came to hate the song: \"He didn't like it. That song stuck and he couldn't get it off his shoe. He always thought that song was self-serving and self-indulgent.\"\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nVersions\nDavid Bowie reportedly wrote the first English language lyrics to Claude Fran\u00e7ois's original tune, though the lyrics and performance were only informally recorded and never commercially published.\n\nDorothy Squires\nIn the midst of Sinatra's multiple runs on the UK Singles Chart, Welsh singer Dorothy Squires also released a rendition of \"My Way\" in summer 1970. Her recording reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart and re-entered the chart twice more during that year.\n\nElvis Presley\nElvis Presley began performing the song in concert during the mid-1970s, despite Anka's suggestions that the song did not suit him. Nevertheless, on January 12 and 14, 1973, Presley sang the song during his satellite show Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite, beamed live and on deferred basis (for European audiences, who also saw it in prime time), to 43 countries via Intelsat.\nOn October 3, 1977, several weeks after Presley's death, his live recording of \"My Way\" (recorded for the Elvis In Concert CBS-TV special on June 21, 1977) was released as a single. In the U.S., it reached number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart in late 1977\/early 1978 (higher than Frank Sinatra's peak position), number 6 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, and went gold for its successful sales of over a million copies. The following year the single reached number 2 on the Billboard Country singles chart but went all the way to number 1 on the rival Cash Box Country Singles chart. In the UK, it reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.\nPresley's version is featured in the climax of the 2001 film 3000 Miles to Graceland with Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner. (Paul Anka appears in a cameo as a casino pit boss who loathes Presley.)\nPresley's studio version of the song, recorded in 1971, was included on the fourth disc of \"Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential '70s Masters\".\n\nCertifications\nSid Vicious\nSex Pistols' bassist Sid Vicious did a punk rock version of the song, in which a large body of the words were changed and the arrangement was sped up. The orchestral backing was arranged by Simon Jeffes.\nInterviewed in 2007, Paul Anka said he had been \"somewhat destabilized by the Sex Pistols' version. It was kind of curious, but I felt he [Sid Vicious] was sincere about it.\"Vicious and his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, changed many of the words when it was recorded, including use of the swear words \"cunt\" and \"fuck\" as well as the word \"queer\" (slang for a gay man). Vicious's reference to a \"prat who wears hats\" was an in-joke directed towards Vicious's friend and Sex Pistols bandmate Johnny Rotten, who was fond of wearing different kinds of hats he would pick up at rummage sales.\nLeonard Cohen said of the song: I never liked this song except when Sid Vicious did it. Sung straight, it somehow deprives the appetite of a certain taste we'd like to have on our lips. When Sid Vicious did it, he provided that other side to the song; the certainty, the self-congratulation, the daily heroism of Sinatra's version is completely exploded by this desperate, mad, humorous voice. I can't go round in a raincoat and fedora looking over my life saying I did it my way \u2013 well, for 10 minutes in some American bar over a gin and tonic you might be able to get away with it. But Sid Vicious's rendition takes in everybody; everybody is messed up like that, everybody is the mad hero of his own drama. It explodes the whole culture this self-presentation can take place in, so it completes the song for me.\nThe 1986 film Sid and Nancy features a scene where Gary Oldman, portraying Vicious, performs his version of \"My Way\" while filming the song's music video.Vicious's version of this song appears in Martin Scorsese's 1990 film Goodfellas, where it plays over the end credits.\n\nMargaret Mackie and Jamie Lee Morley\nIn December 2019 footage of Margaret Mackie, a resident of Northcare Suites Care Home in Edinburgh who suffers from dementia, performing \"My Way\" with staff member Jamie Lee Morley, went viral after being posted online by Mackie's daughter.Morley later arranged to have the song professionally recorded and it was released in January 2020 as a charity single to raise funds for The Alzheimer's Society and Dementia UK. The single peaked at number seven in the iTunes top 40 UK Pop Songs live chart and number five in the Amazon best seller chart.\n\nYuzo Kayama\nIn Japan, Yuzo Kayama, who is usually called the Japanese Frank Sinatra, performed \"My Way\" in 2008 in English. On April 23 and 30, 2015, as part of 2 vocal overdubbed sessions, Yuzo Kayama performed \"My Way\" with the earlier record of Frank Sinatra as a duet.\n\nAdaptations\nBesides translations more or less faithful to the original, some artists have set unrelated lyrics to the same tune.\n\nJozsef Gregor the renowned Hungarian bass-baritone\/basso buffo recorded the song with Andras Ruszanov's Hungarian love themed lyrics version in 1996. Two years later, he sang this version in one of the most popular TV show in Budapest, since then this version has been permanently on the playlists of numerous radio stations in Hungary.\nMexican singer Vicente Fernandez did a Spanish language version, named \"A Mi Manera\".\nA version of the song with slightly different lyrics was used as a jingle for a Cologuard commercial in 2022.\n\nPublic use\nThe song is popularly associated with nostalgia to an individual's lifetime of events. Surveys beginning in 2005 have often reported that \"My Way\" has been the song most frequently played at funeral services in the UK. \"My Way\" is also a popular karaoke song around the world. However, it has been reported to cause numerous incidents of violence and homicide among karaoke singers in the Philippines, referred to in the media as the My Way killings, which has led to the song being banned in many Filipino bars.The song's association with Sinatra led to Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of allowing other states in the Warsaw Pact to make their own policy decisions being nicknamed the Sinatra Doctrine, referencing \"My Way\"'s lyrics about doing things your own way. The term was first used by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov in 1987, who was quoted as saying \"We now have the Frank Sinatra doctrine. He has a song, I Did It My Way. So every country decides on its own which road to take.\"\nPassage 6:\nFollowin' a Feelin'\nFollowin' a Feelin' is the third studio album by Australian country music artist Sherri\u00e9 Austin. It was released in 2001 by WE Records and peaked at No. 43 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. The album's only charted single was a cover of Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\". Austin's version of the song reached No. 55 on the Hot Country Songs charts in July 2001.\n\nCritical reception\nMaria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying that \"She's evolved into an exceptionally strong songwriter, having written or co-written nine of the album's ten virtually flawless tracks.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\"Followin' a Feelin'\" (Sherri\u00e9 Austin, Rob Crosby, Will Rambeaux) \u2014 3:19\n\"Jolene\" (Dolly Parton) \u2014 3:17\n\"Goin' Goin' Gone\" (Austin, Rambeaux, Jon Christopher Davis) \u2014 4:14\n\"Somethin' Missin' in the Kissin'\" (Austin, Rambeaux, Blair Daly) \u2014 3:21\n\"In the Meantime\" (Austin, Rambeaux, Crosby) \u2014 3:41\n\"My Brilliant Mistake\" (Austin, Rambeaux, Greg Barnhill) \u2014 3:17\n\"In Our Own Sweet Time\" (Austin, Rambeaux, Marcus Hummon) \u2014 3:07\n\"Love Melts Even the Coldest Hearts\" (Austin, Shawna Harrington-Burkhart) \u2014 3:17\n\"Back Where I Belong\" (Austin, Rambeaux, Kimberly Roads, Philip Sweet) \u2014 3:00\n\"Time, Love and Money\" (Austin, Rambeaux, Dave Berg) \u2014 3:11\n\nPersonnel\nStephanie Bentley - backing vocals\nPat Buchanan - electric guitar\nJ.

It was released in March 2010 as the second single and title track from his debut album of the same name. Thompson co-wrote the song with David Lee Murphy and Casey Beathard.\n\nContent\n\"Way Out Here\" is a ballad, mostly accompanied by acoustic guitar. In it, the narrator tells of his rural upbringing, the way he was raised, and his desire for the United States to return to a simpler time, back when things \"were run the way they ought a be\".  The song further laments small town America, stating with nostalgia images of pickup trucks, unlicensed dogs running free, and hard working blue collar men who \"chew and fry everything\".  A further narrative relates to service in the United States armed forces, of which the narrator tells how people from small town America often wind up joining the military to earn a living and are then deployed overseas.\n\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Way Out Here\" was filmed in Cairo, Illinois.  The video begins with scenes of farms, a diner run by a young woman in her late teens (apparently married with a wedding ring and also religious locket which reads \"faith\") then shifts to a local bar where the narrator sings the song on his guitar.  Interspersed into the video are scenes of men working on a farm as well as scenes of young men deployed in the Army to the Middle East.\n\nCritical reception\nThe song and video drew mostly positive reviews from critics, however some negative reviews resulted from the portrayal in the music video of an entirely white town (Cairo, Illinois is in fact 70% African American), as well as nostalgia (instead of concern) regarding boarded up small towns steeped in rural poverty.  Paul Brian of Engine 145, gave the song a thumbs-down rating. His review criticized Thompson's vocals for \"[simmering] with anger, despair, and moral force as the song approaches numerous key concerns including the economy, military service, work ethic, religious belief, gun ownership, governance, and musical taste.\"\n\nChart performance\n\"Way Out Here\" debuted at number 57 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated March 20, 2010, and then fell off the next week. However, it re-entered the country chart at number 58 on the chart dated April 3, 2010. In September 2010, it peaked at number 15 on the chart.\n\nYear-end charts\nPassage 8:\nTurn Me On (Mark Dinning song)\n\"Turn Me On\" is a song by John D. Loudermilk that was first recorded and released by Mark Dinning in 1961 as the B-side to his single \"Lonely Island\". Other notable versions are by Nellie Rutherford and Nina Simone. Norah Jones released her version as the last single from her debut album Come Away with Me on May 12, 2003. The song was also performed by Shelby Dressel during her American Idol audition. It has been suggested that the song influenced the composition of Leonard Cohen's 1969 song \"Bird on the Wire\".\n\nNorah Jones version\nJones's cover was the seventh track on her debut album. This version also appeared in the movie Love Actually and appears on its soundtrack.\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nRelease history\nPassage 9:\nKingpin (Tinsley Ellis album)\nKingpin is a 2000 blues album by Tinsley Ellis.

When it comes to matters of right and wrong, he likes to think of himself as inflexible. Anne, his much younger wife, is accommodating and dutiful and likes the life they lead, the house in London, the Buckinghamshire hideaway. The couple seems to have it all, yet events soon will prove them wrong.\nIn the village, a neighbour has reappeared: William Bule, son of a leading local family. He has recently returned from America, a bad marriage and two children, whose ages he cannot bother to remember. Bill is indolent and insinuating and at the village cricket match he catches Anne's eye. Because of him, she suggests to her reluctant husband that they should have neighbours over for drinks. However, that evening, James has to work late in the city. Before the party is set to begin, a speeding car sideswipes a man bicycling along a village lane. The man is hurled to the ground and dies a few days later. He was the husband of Maggie, the Mannings\u2019 housekeeper.\nAnne takes a special interest in Maggie's well-being, but James can't understand her sudden teary investment in their housekeeper\u2019s personal life. James, whose priorities have become skewed toward work rather than toward his wife, soon becomes suspicious that Bill may be involved in that fatal hit-and-run. When confronted, Bill initially denies the allegation, but soon tells James that the next day he will go to the police and confess, if that is what he wants, although he sees no benefit from his confessions. Back home, when James tells Anne about his conversation with Bill, she has also some striking confessions to make. Anne reveals one hurtful secret while making a salad: she was actually driving Bill\u2019s car when drunk and accidentally hit the cyclist.  While artfully arranging ingredients on a platter, she informs her already distraught husband that she has also been having an affair with Bill. Telling her story, she asserts that Bill doesn't really mean anything to her, because he doesn't make demands or judge her, as James does in little, incessant ways. Precisely because he's a lout, Bill makes her feel oddly liberated, if not loved.\nAs a Buckinghamshire police inspector questions the Mannings and Bill about the accident, James is torn between doing the right thing and maintaining appearances at all costs. James really loves Anne, and the couple takes a trip to Wales in an effort to leave the accident, their guilt, and their marital troubles behind. However, Maggie, whose husband was killed, witnessed the accident. She saw the car and identifies it as belonging to Bill Bule. Yet her testimony may be biased, since Maggie knows William Bule well, having worked for his family until she was accused of stealing and dismissed. It was Anne who gave her a new start in the village.\nBule calls for a meeting  with James and Anne. There he says the inspector will come to question them later and that Maggie has identified the car. He requests James to provide an alibi for him to which James agrees. Next day the inspector meets James at his office to confirm the alibi claimed by Bule. Later a mechanic calls Bule to tell about the questioning from police about respraying the car. This makes Anne nervous and she runs to Maggie to tell her the truth and that she is responsible for her husband's death. Maggie being indebted to Anne for giving her the job after eight years takes back her statement about Bule driving the car when confronted by police. Anne goes back to stay with James until one day he's informed by a cousin of Bule that he is dying of cancer. Learning this from James, Anne rushes back to the dying Bule whose father comes to James to express his gratitude for this. Following this James meets Anne near Bule's home and expresses his undiminished love for her. Upon the demise of Bule, Anne is reunited with James.\n\nCast\nTom Wilkinson as James Manning\nEmily Watson as Anne Manning\nRupert Everett as William \"Bill\" Bule\nRichenda Carey as Sarah Tufnell\nDavid Harewood as Inspector Marshall\nLinda Bassett as Maggie\nHermione Norris as Priscilla\nJohn Warnaby as Simon\nJohn Neville as Lord Rawston\nPhilip Rham as French Lawyer\nUnknown as Joe\n\nExternal links\nSeparate Lies at IMDb\nSeparate Lies at Rotten Tomatoes\nSeparate Lies at Box Office Mojo\nPassage 12:\nFeelin' the Same Way\n\"Feelin' the Same Way\" is a song from American singer-songwriter Norah Jones's debut album, Come Away with Me (2002).

{"context":"Introduction\nDistributed word representations, commonly referred to as word embeddings BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , serve as elementary building blocks in the course of algorithm design for an expanding range of applications in natural language processing (NLP), including named entity recognition BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , parsing BIBREF6 , sentiment analysis BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , and word-sense disambiguation BIBREF9 . Although the empirical utility of word embeddings as an unsupervised method for capturing the semantic or syntactic features of a certain word as it is used in a given lexical resource is well-established BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , an understanding of what these features mean remains an open problem BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 and as such word embeddings mostly remain a black box. It is desirable to be able to develop insight into this black box and be able to interpret what it means, while retaining the utility of word embeddings as semantically-rich intermediate representations. Other than the intrinsic value of this insight, this would not only allow us to explain and understand how algorithms work BIBREF15 , but also set a ground that would facilitate the design of new algorithms in a more deliberate way.\nRecent approaches to generating word embeddings (e.g. BIBREF0 , BIBREF2 ) are rooted linguistically in the field of distributed semantics BIBREF16 , where words are taken to assume meaning mainly by their degree of interaction (or lack thereof) with other words in the lexicon BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . Under this paradigm, dense, continuous vector representations are learned in an unsupervised manner from a large corpus, using the word cooccurrence statistics directly or indirectly, and such an approach is shown to result in vector representations that mathematically capture various semantic and syntactic relations between words BIBREF0 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . However, the dense nature of the learned embeddings obfuscate the distinct concepts encoded in the different dimensions, which renders the resulting vectors virtually uninterpretable. The learned embeddings make sense only in relation to each other and their specific dimensions do not carry explicit information that can be interpreted. However, being able to interpret a word embedding would illuminate the semantic concepts implicitly represented along the various dimensions of the embedding, and reveal its hidden semantic structures.\nIn the literature, researchers tackled interpretability problem of the word embeddings using different approaches. Several researchers BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 proposed algorithms based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) applied to cooccurrence variant matrices. Other researchers suggested to obtain interpretable word vectors from existing uninterpretable word vectors by applying sparse coding BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 , by training a sparse auto-encoder to transform the embedding space BIBREF24 , by rotating the original embeddings BIBREF25 , BIBREF26 or by applying transformations based on external semantic datasets BIBREF27 .\nAlthough the above-mentioned approaches provide better interpretability that is measured using a particular method such as word intrusion test, usually the improved interpretability comes with a cost of performance in the benchmark tests such as word similarity or word analogy. One possible explanation for this performance decrease is that the proposed transformations from the original embedding space distort the underlying semantic structure constructed by the original embedding algorithm. Therefore, it can be claimed that a method that learns dense and interpretable word embeddings without inflicting any damage to the underlying semantic learning mechanism is the key to achieve both high performing and interpretable word embeddings.\nEspecially after the introduction of the word2vec algorithm by Mikolov BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , there has been a growing interest in algorithms that generate improved word representations under some performance metric. Significant effort is spent on appropriately modifying the objective functions of the algorithms in order to incorporate knowledge from external resources, with the purpose of increasing the performance of the resulting word representations BIBREF28 , BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 , BIBREF33 , BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 , BIBREF36 , BIBREF37 . Inspired by the line of work reported in these studies, we propose to use modified objective functions for a different purpose: learning more interpretable dense word embeddings. By doing this, we aim to incorporate semantic information from an external lexical resource into the word embedding so that the embedding dimensions are aligned along predefined concepts. This alignment is achieved by introducing a modification to the embedding learning process. In our proposed method, which is built on top of the GloVe algorithm BIBREF2 , the cost function for any one of the words of concept word-groups is modified by the introduction of an additive term to the cost function. Each embedding vector dimension is first associated with a concept. For a word belonging to any one of the word-groups representing these concepts, the modified cost term favors an increase for the value of this word's embedding vector dimension corresponding to the concept that the particular word belongs to. For words that do not belong to any one of the word-groups, the cost term is left untouched. Specifically, Roget's Thesaurus BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 is used to derive the concepts and concept word-groups to be used as the external lexical resource for our proposed method. We quantitatively demonstrate the increase in interpretability by using the measure given in BIBREF27 , BIBREF40 as well as demonstrating qualitative results. We also show that the semantic structure of the original embedding has not been harmed in the process since there is no performance loss with standard word-similarity or word-analogy tests.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section SECREF2 , we discuss previous studies related to our work under two main categories: interpretability of word embeddings and joint-learning frameworks where the objective function is modified. In Section SECREF3 , we present the problem framework and provide the formulation within the GloVe BIBREF2 algorithm setting. In Section SECREF4 where our approach is proposed, we motivate and develop a modification to the original objective function with the aim of increasing representation interpretability. In Section SECREF5 , experimental results are provided and the proposed method is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. Additionally, in Section SECREF5 , results demonstrating the extent to which the original semantic structure of the embedding space is affected are presented by using word-analogy and word-similarity tests. We conclude the paper in Section SECREF6 .\nRelated Work\nMethodologically, our work is related to prior studies that aim to obtain \u201cimproved\u201d word embeddings using external lexical resources, under some performance metric. Previous work in this area can be divided into two main categories: works that i) modify the word embedding learning algorithm to incorporate lexical information, ii) operate on pre-trained embeddings with a post-processing step.\nAmong works that follow the first approach, BIBREF28 extend the Skip-Gram model by incorporating the word similarity relations extracted from the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) and WordNet BIBREF29 , into the Skip-Gram predictive model as an additional cost term. In BIBREF30 , the authors extend the CBOW model by considering two types of semantic information, termed relational and categorical, to be incorporated into the embeddings during training. For the former type of semantic information, the authors propose the learning of explicit vectors for the different relations extracted from a semantic lexicon such that the word pairs that satisfy the same relation are distributed more homogeneously. For the latter, the authors modify the learning objective such that some weighted average distance is minimized for words under the same semantic category. In BIBREF31 , the authors represent the synonymy and hypernymy-hyponymy relations in terms of inequality constraints, where the pairwise similarity rankings over word triplets are forced to follow an order extracted from a lexical resource. Following their extraction from WordNet, the authors impose these constraints in the form of an additive cost term to the Skip-Gram formulation. Finally, BIBREF32 builds on top of the GloVe algorithm by introducing a regularization term to the objective function that encourages the vector representations of similar words as dictated by WordNet to be similar as well.\nTurning our attention to the post-processing approach for enriching word embeddings with external lexical knowledge, BIBREF33 has introduced the retrofitting algorithm that acts on pre-trained embeddings such as Skip-Gram or GloVe. The authors propose an objective function that aims to balance out the semantic information captured in the pre-trained embeddings with the constraints derived from lexical resources such as WordNet, PPDB and FrameNet. One of the models proposed in BIBREF34 extends the retrofitting approach to incorporate the word sense information from WordNet. Similarly, BIBREF35 creates multi-sense embeddings by gathering the word sense information from a lexical resource and learning to decompose the pre-trained embeddings into a convex combination of sense embeddings. In BIBREF36 , the authors focus on improving word embeddings for capturing word similarity, as opposed to mere relatedness. To this end, they introduce the counter-fitting technique which acts on the input word vectors such that synonymous words are attracted to one another whereas antonymous words are repelled, where the synonymy-antonymy relations are extracted from a lexical resource. More recently, the ATTRACT-REPEL algorithm proposed by BIBREF37 improves on counter-fitting by a formulation which imparts the word vectors with external lexical information in mini-batches.\nMost of the studies discussed above ( BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 , BIBREF33 , BIBREF34 , BIBREF36 , BIBREF37 ) report performance improvements in benchmark tests such as word similarity or word analogy, while BIBREF29 uses a different analysis method (mean reciprocal rank). In sum, the literature is rich with studies aiming to obtain word embeddings that perform better under specific performance metrics. However, less attention has been directed to the issue of interpretability of the word embeddings. In the literature, the problem of interpretability has been tackled using different approaches. BIBREF19 proposed non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for learning sparse, interpretable word vectors from co-occurrence variant matrices where the resulting vector space is called non-negative sparse embeddigns (NNSE). However, since NMF methods require maintaining a global matrix for learning, they suffer from memory and scale issue. This problem has been addressed in BIBREF20 where an online method of learning interpretable word embeddings from corpora using a modified version of skip-gram model BIBREF0 is proposed. As a different approach, BIBREF21 combined text-based similarity information among words with brain activity based similarity information to improve interpretability using joint non-negative sparse embedding (JNNSE).\nA common alternative approach for learning interpretable embeddings is to learn transformations that map pre-trained state-of-the-art embeddings to new interpretable semantic spaces. To obtain sparse, higher dimensional and more interpretable vector spaces, BIBREF22 and BIBREF23 use sparse coding on conventional dense word embeddings. However, these methods learn the projection vectors that are used for the transformation from the word embeddings without supervision. For this reason, labels describing the corresponding semantic categories cannot be provided. An alternative approach was proposed in BIBREF25 , where orthogonal transformations were utilized to increase interpretability while preserving the performance of the underlying embedding. However, BIBREF25 has also shown that total interpretability of an embedding is kept constant under any orthogonal transformation and it can only be redistributed across the dimensions. Rotation algorithms based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to preserve the performance of the original word embeddings while improving their interpretability was proposed in BIBREF26 . BIBREF24 proposed to deploy a sparse auto-encoder using pre-trained dense word embeddings to improve interpretability. More detailed investigation of semantic structure and interpretability of word embeddings can be found in BIBREF27 , where a metric was proposed to quantitatively measure the degree of interpretability already present in the embedding vector spaces.\nPrevious works on interpretability mentioned above, except BIBREF21 , BIBREF27 and our proposed method, do not need external resources, utilization of which has both advantages and disadvantages. Methods that do not use external resources require fewer resources but they also lack the aid of information extracted from these resources.\nProblem Description\nFor the task of unsupervised word embedding extraction, we operate on a discrete collection of lexical units (words) INLINEFORM0 that is part of an input corpus INLINEFORM1 , with number of tokens INLINEFORM2 , sourced from a vocabulary INLINEFORM3 of size INLINEFORM4 . In the setting of distributional semantics, the objective of a word embedding algorithm is to maximize some aggregate utility over the entire corpus so that some measure of \u201ccloseness\u201d is maximized for pairs of vector representations INLINEFORM14 for words which, on the average, appear in proximity to one another. In the GloVe algorithm BIBREF2 , which we base our improvements upon, the following objective function is considered: DISPLAYFORM0\nIn ( EQREF6 ), INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 stand for word and context vector representations, respectively, for words INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 , while INLINEFORM4 represents the (possibly weighted) cooccurrence count for the word pair INLINEFORM5 . Intuitively, ( EQREF6 ) represents the requirement that if some word INLINEFORM6 occurs often enough in the context (or vicinity) of another word INLINEFORM7 , then the corresponding word representations should have a large enough inner product in keeping with their large INLINEFORM8 value, up to some bias terms INLINEFORM9 ; and vice versa. INLINEFORM10 in ( EQREF6 ) is used as a discounting factor that prohibits rare cooccurrences from disproportionately influencing the resulting embeddings.\nThe objective ( EQREF6 ) is minimized using stochastic gradient descent by iterating over the matrix of cooccurrence records INLINEFORM0 . In the GloVe algorithm, for a given word INLINEFORM1 , the final word representation is taken to be the average of the two intermediate vector representations obtained from ( EQREF6 ); i.e, INLINEFORM2 . In the next section, we detail the enhancements made to ( EQREF6 ) for the purposes of enhanced interpretability, using the aforementioned framework as our basis.\nImparting Interpretability\nOur approach falls into a joint-learning framework where the distributional information extracted from the corpus is allowed to fuse with the external lexicon-based information. Word-groups extracted from Roget's Thesaurus are directly mapped to individual dimensions of word embeddings. Specifically, the vector representations of words that belong to a particular group are encouraged to have deliberately increased values in a particular dimension that corresponds to the word-group under consideration. This can be achieved by modifying the objective function of the embedding algorithm to partially influence vector representation distributions across their dimensions over an input vocabulary. To do this, we propose the following modification to the GloVe objective in ( EQREF6 ): rCl J = i,j=1V f(Xij)[ (wiTwj + bi + bj -Xij)2\n+ k(l=1D INLINEFORM0 iFl g(wi,l) + l=1D INLINEFORM1 j Fl g(wj,l) ) ]. In ( SECREF4 ), INLINEFORM2 denotes the indices for the elements of the INLINEFORM3 th concept word-group which we wish to assign in the vector dimension INLINEFORM4 . The objective ( SECREF4 ) is designed as a mixture of two individual cost terms: the original GloVe cost term along with a second term that encourages embedding vectors of a given concept word-group to achieve deliberately increased values along an associated dimension INLINEFORM5 . The relative weight of the second term is controlled by the parameter INLINEFORM6 . The simultaneous minimization of both objectives ensures that words that are similar to, but not included in, one of these concept word-groups are also \u201cnudged\u201d towards the associated dimension INLINEFORM7 . The trained word vectors are thus encouraged to form a distribution where the individual vector dimensions align with certain semantic concepts represented by a collection of concept word-groups, one assigned to each vector dimension. To facilitate this behaviour, ( SECREF4 ) introduces a monotone decreasing function INLINEFORM8 defined as INLINEFORM9\nwhich serves to increase the total cost incurred if the value of the INLINEFORM0 th dimension for the two vector representations INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 for a concept word INLINEFORM3 with INLINEFORM4 fails to be large enough. INLINEFORM5 is also shown in Fig. FIGREF7 .\nThe objective ( SECREF4 ) is minimized using stochastic gradient descent over the cooccurrence records INLINEFORM0 . Intuitively, the terms added to ( SECREF4 ) in comparison with ( EQREF6 ) introduce the effect of selectively applying a positive step-type input to the original descent updates of ( EQREF6 ) for concept words along their respective vector dimensions, which influences the dimension value in the positive direction. The parameter INLINEFORM1 in ( SECREF4 ) allows for the adjustment of the magnitude of this influence as needed.\nIn the next section, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by experiments with an example collection of concept word-groups extracted from Roget's Thesaurus.\nExperiments and Results\nWe first identified 300 concepts, one for each dimension of the 300-dimensional vector representation, by employing Roget's Thesaurus. This thesaurus follows a tree structure which starts with a Root node that contains all the words and phrases in the thesaurus. The root node is successively split into Classes and Sections, which are then (optionally) split into Subsections of various depths, finally ending in Categories, which constitute the smallest unit of word\/phrase collections in the structure. The actual words and phrases descend from these Categories, and make up the leaves of the tree structure. We note that a given word typically appears in multiple categories corresponding to the different senses of the word. We constructed concept word-groups from Roget's Thesaurus as follows: We first filtered out the multi-word phrases and the relatively obscure terms from the thesaurus. The obscure terms were identified by checking them against a vocabulary extracted from Wikipedia. We then obtained 300 word-groups as the result of a partitioning operation applied to the subtree that ends with categories as its leaves. The partition boundaries, hence the resulting word-groups, can be chosen in many different ways. In our proposed approach, we have chosen to determine this partitioning by traversing this tree structure from the root node in breadth-first order, and by employing a parameter INLINEFORM0 for the maximum size of a node. Here, the size of a node is defined as the number of unique words that ever-descend from that node. During the traversal, if the size of a given node is less than this threshold, we designate the words that ultimately descend from that node as a concept word-group. Otherwise, if the node has children, we discard the node, and queue up all its children for further consideration. If this node does not have any children, on the other hand, the node is truncated to INLINEFORM1 elements with the highest frequency-ranks, and the resulting words are designated as a concept word-group. We note that the choice of INLINEFORM2 greatly affects the resulting collection of word-groups: Excessively large values result in few word-groups that greatly overlap with one another, while overly small values result in numerous tiny word-groups that fail to adequately represent a concept. We experimentally determined that a INLINEFORM3 value of 452 results in the most healthy number of relatively large word-groups (113 groups with size INLINEFORM4 100), while yielding a preferably small overlap amongst the resulting word-groups (with average overlap size not exceeding 3 words). A total of 566 word-groups were thus obtained. 259 smallest word-groups (with size INLINEFORM5 38) were discarded to bring down the number of word-groups to 307. Out of these, 7 groups with the lowest median frequency-rank were further discarded, which yields the final 300 concept word-groups used in the experiments. We present some of the resulting word-groups in Table TABREF9 .\nBy using the concept word-groups, we have trained the GloVe algorithm with the proposed modification given in Section SECREF4 on a snapshot of English Wikipedia measuring 8GB in size, with the stop-words filtered out. Using the parameters given in Table TABREF10 , this resulted in a vocabulary size of 287,847. For the weighting parameter in Eq. SECREF4 , we used a value of INLINEFORM0 . The algorithm was trained over 20 iterations. The GloVe algorithm without any modifications was also trained as a baseline with the same parameters. In addition to the original GloVe algorithm, we compare our proposed method with previous studies that aim to obtain interpretable word vectors. We train the improved projected gradient model proposed in BIBREF20 to obtain word vectors (called OIWE-IPG) using the same corpus we use to train GloVe and our proposed method. Using the methods proposed in BIBREF23 , BIBREF26 , BIBREF24 on our baseline GloVe embeddings, we obtain SOV, SPINE and Parsimax (orthogonal) word representations, respectively. We train all the models with the proposed parameters. However, in BIBREF26 , the authors show results for a relatively small vocabulary of 15,000 words. When we trained their model on our baseline GloVe embeddings with a large vocabulary of size 287,847, the resulting vectors performed significantly poor on word similarity tasks compared to the results presented in their paper. In addition, Parsimax (orthogonal) word vectors obtained using method in BIBREF26 are nearly identical to the baseline vectors (i.e. learned orthogonal transformation matrix is very close to identity). Therefore, Parsimax (orthogonal) yields almost same results with baseline vectors in all evaluations. We evaluate the interpretability of the resulting embeddings qualitatively and quantitatively. We also test the performance of the embeddings on word similarity and word analogy tests.\nIn our experiments, vocabulary size is close to 300,000 while only 16,242 unique words of the vocabulary are present in the concept groups. Furthermore, only dimensions that correspond to the concept group of the word will be updated due to the additional cost term. Given that these concept words can belong to multiple concept groups (2 on average), only 33,319 parameters are updated. There are 90 million individual parameters present for the 300,000 word vectors of size 300. Of these parameters, only approximately 33,000 are updated by the additional cost term.\nQualitative Evaluation for Interpretability\nIn Fig. FIGREF13 , we demonstrate the particular way in which the proposed algorithm ( SECREF4 ) influences the vector representation distributions. Specifically, we consider, for illustration, the 32nd dimension values for the original GloVe algorithm and our modified version, restricting the plots to the top-1000 words with respect to their frequency ranks for clarity of presentation. In Fig. FIGREF13 , the words in the horizontal axis are sorted in descending order with respect to the values at the 32nd dimension of their word embedding vectors coming from the original GloVe algorithm. The dimension values are denoted with blue and red\/green markers for the original and the proposed algorithms, respectively. Additionally, the top-50 words that achieve the greatest 32nd dimension values among the considered 1000 words are emphasized with enlarged markers, along with text annotations. In the presented simulation of the proposed algorithm, the 32nd dimension values are encoded with the concept JUDGMENT, which is reflected as an increase in the dimension values for words such as committee, academy, and article. We note that these words (red) are not part of the pre-determined word-group for the concept JUDGMENT, in contrast to words such as award, review and account (green) which are. This implies that the increase in the corresponding dimension values seen for these words is attributable to the joint effect of the first term in ( SECREF4 ) which is inherited from the original GloVe algorithm, in conjunction with the remaining terms in the proposed objective expression ( SECREF4 ). This experiment illustrates that the proposed algorithm is able to impart the concept of JUDGMENT on its designated vector dimension above and beyond the supplied list of words belonging to the concept word-group for that dimension. We also present the list of words with the greatest dimension value for the dimensions 11, 13, 16, 31, 36, 39, 41, 43 and 79 in Table TABREF11 . These dimensions are aligned\/imparted with the concepts that are given in the column headers. In Table TABREF11 , the words that are highlighted with green denote the words that exist in the corresponding word-group obtained from Roget's Thesaurus (and are thus explicitly forced to achieve increased dimension values), while the red words denote the words that achieve increased dimension values by virtue of their cooccurrence statistics with the thesaurus-based words (indirectly, without being explicitly forced). This again illustrates that a semantic concept can indeed be coded to a vector dimension provided that a sensible lexical resource is used to guide semantically related words to the desired vector dimension via the proposed objective function in ( SECREF4 ). Even the words that do not appear in, but are semantically related to, the word-groups that we formed using Roget's Thesaurus, are indirectly affected by the proposed algorithm. They also reflect the associated concepts at their respective dimensions even though the objective functions for their particular vectors are not modified. This point cannot be overemphasized. Although the word-groups extracted from Roget's Thesaurus impose a degree of supervision to the process, the fact that the remaining words in the entire vocabulary are also indirectly affected makes the proposed method a semi-supervised approach that can handle words that are not in these chosen word-groups. A qualitative example of this result can be seen in the last column of Table TABREF11 . It is interesting to note the appearance of words such as guerilla, insurgency, mujahideen, Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe in addition to the more obvious and straightforward army, soldiers and troops, all of which are not present in the associated word-group WARFARE.\nMost of the dimensions we investigated exhibit similar behaviour to the ones presented in Table TABREF11 . Thus generally speaking, we can say that the entries in Table TABREF11 are representative of the great majority. However, we have also specifically looked for dimensions that make less sense and determined a few such dimensions which are relatively less satisfactory. These less satisfactory examples are given in Table TABREF14 . These examples are also interesting in that they shed insight into the limitations posed by polysemy and existence of very rare outlier words.\nQuantitative Evaluation for Interpretability\nOne of the main goals of this study is to improve the interpretability of dense word embeddings by aligning the dimensions with predefined concepts from a suitable lexicon. A quantitative measure is required to reliably evaluate the achieved improvement. One of the methods proposed to measure the interpretability is the word intrusion test BIBREF41 . But, this method is expensive to apply since it requires evaluations from multiple human evaluators for each embedding dimension. In this study, we use a semantic category-based approach based on the method and category dataset (SEMCAT) introduced in BIBREF27 to quantify interpretability. Specifically, we apply a modified version of the approach presented in BIBREF40 in order to consider possible sub-groupings within the categories in SEMCAT. Interpretability scores are calculated using Interpretability Score (IS) as given below:\nDISPLAYFORM0\nIn ( EQREF17 ), INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 represents the interpretability scores in the positive and negative directions of the INLINEFORM2 dimension ( INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 number of dimensions in the embedding space) of word embedding space for the INLINEFORM5 category ( INLINEFORM6 , INLINEFORM7 is number of categories in SEMCAT, INLINEFORM8 ) in SEMCAT respectively. INLINEFORM9 is the set of words in the INLINEFORM10 category in SEMCAT and INLINEFORM11 is the number of words in INLINEFORM12 . INLINEFORM13 corresponds to the minimum number of words required to construct a semantic category (i.e. represent a concept). INLINEFORM14 represents the set of INLINEFORM15 words that have the highest ( INLINEFORM16 ) and lowest ( INLINEFORM17 ) values in INLINEFORM18 dimension of the embedding space. INLINEFORM19 is the intersection operator and INLINEFORM20 is the cardinality operator (number of elements) for the intersecting set. In ( EQREF17 ), INLINEFORM21 gives the interpretability score for the INLINEFORM22 dimension and INLINEFORM23 gives the average interpretability score of the embedding space.\nFig. FIGREF18 presents the measured average interpretability scores across dimensions for original GloVe embeddings, for the proposed method and for the other four methods we compare, along with a randomly generated embedding. Results are calculated for the parameters INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . Our proposed method significantly improves the interpretability for all INLINEFORM2 compared to the original GloVe approach. Our proposed method is second to only SPINE in increasing interpretability. However, as we will experimentally demonstrate in the next subsection, in doing this, SPINE almost entirely destroys the underlying semantic structure of the word embeddings, which is the primary function of a word embedding.\nThe proposed method and interpretability measurements are both based on utilizing concepts represented by word-groups. Therefore it is expected that there will be higher interpretability scores for some of the dimensions for which the imparted concepts are also contained in SEMCAT. However, by design, word groups that they use are formed by using different sources and are independent. Interpretability measurements use SEMCAT while our proposed method utilizes Roget's Thesaurus.\nIntrinsic Evaluation of the Embeddings\nIt is necessary to show that the semantic structure of the original embedding has not been damaged or distorted as a result of aligning the dimensions with given concepts, and that there is no substantial sacrifice involved from the performance that can be obtained with the original GloVe. To check this, we evaluate performances of the proposed embeddings on word similarity BIBREF42 and word analogy BIBREF0 tests. We compare the results with the original embeddings and the three alternatives excluding Parsimax BIBREF26 since orthogonal transformations will not affect the performance of the original embeddings on these tests.\nWord similarity test measures the correlation between word similarity scores obtained from human evaluation (i.e. true similarities) and from word embeddings (usually using cosine similarity). In other words, this test quantifies how well the embedding space reflects human judgements in terms of similarities between different words. The correlation scores for 13 different similarity test sets are reported in Table TABREF20 . We observe that, let alone a reduction in performance, the obtained scores indicate an almost uniform improvement in the correlation values for the proposed algorithm, outperforming all the alternatives in almost all test sets. Categories from Roget's thesaurus are groupings of words that are similar in some sense which the original embedding algorithm may fail to capture. These test results signify that the semantic information injected into the algorithm by the additional cost term is significant enough to result in a measurable improvement. It should also be noted that scores obtained by SPINE is unacceptably low on almost all tests indicating that it has achieved its interpretability performance at the cost of losing its semantic functions.\nWord analogy test is introduced in BIBREF1 and looks for the answers of the questions that are in the form of \"X is to Y, what Z is to ?\" by applying simple arithmetic operations to vectors of words X, Y and Z. We present precision scores for the word analogy tests in Table TABREF21 . It can be seen that the alternative approaches that aim to improve interpretability, have poor performance on the word analogy tests. However, our proposed method has comparable performance with the original GloVe embeddings. Our method outperforms GloVe in semantic analogy test set and in overall results, while GloVe performs slightly better in syntactic test set. This comparable performance is mainly due to the cost function of our proposed method that includes the original objective of the GloVe.\nTo investigate the effect of the additional cost term on the performance improvement in the semantic analogy test, we present Table TABREF22 . In particular, we present results for the cases where i) all questions in the dataset are considered, ii) only the questions that contains at least one concept word are considered, iii) only the questions that consist entirely of concept words are considered. We note specifically that for the last case, only a subset of the questions under the semantic category family.txt ended up being included. We observe that for all three scenarios, our proposed algorithm results in an improvement in the precision scores. However, the greatest performance increase is seen for the last scenario, which underscores the extent to which the semantic features captured by embeddings can be improved with a reasonable selection of the lexical resource from which the concept word-groups were derived.\nConclusion\nWe presented a novel approach to impart interpretability into word embeddings. We achieved this by encouraging different dimensions of the vector representation to align with predefined concepts, through the addition of an additional cost term in the optimization objective of the GloVe algorithm that favors a selective increase for a pre-specified input of concept words along each dimension.\nWe demonstrated the efficacy of this approach by applying qualitative and quantitative evaluations for interpretability. We also showed via standard word-analogy and word-similarity tests that the semantic coherence of the original vector space is preserved, even slightly improved. We have also performed and reported quantitative comparisons with several other methods for both interpretabilty increase and preservation of semantic coherence. Upon inspection of Fig. FIGREF18 and Tables TABREF20 , TABREF21 , and TABREF22 altogether, it should be noted that our proposed method achieves both of the objectives simultaneously, increased interpretability and preservation of the intrinsic semantic structure.\nAn important point was that, while it is expected for words that are already included in the concept word-groups to be aligned together since their dimensions are directly updated with the proposed cost term, it was also observed that words not in these groups also aligned in a meaningful manner without any direct modification to their cost function. This indicates that the cost term we added works productively with the original cost function of GloVe to handle words that are not included in the original concept word-groups, but are semantically related to those word-groups. The underlying mechanism can be explained as follows. While the outside lexical resource we introduce contains a relatively small number of words compared to the total number of words, these words and the categories they represent have been carefully chosen and in a sense, \"densely span\" all the words in the language. By saying \"span\", we mean they cover most of the concepts and ideas in the language without leaving too many uncovered areas. With \"densely\" we mean all areas are covered with sufficient strength. In other words, this subset of words is able to constitute a sufficiently strong skeleton, or scaffold. Now remember that GloVe works to align or bring closer related groups of words, which will include words from the lexical source. So the joint action of aligning the words with the predefined categories (introduced by us) and aligning related words (handled by GloVe) allows words not in the lexical groups to also be aligned meaningfully. We may say that the non-included words are \"pulled along\" with the included words by virtue of the \"strings\" or \"glue\" that is provided by GloVe. In numbers, the desired effect is achieved by manipulating less than only 0.05% of parameters of the entire word vectors. Thus, while there is a degree of supervision coming from the external lexical resource, the rest of the vocabulary is also aligned indirectly in an unsupervised way. This may be the reason why, unlike earlier proposed approaches, our method is able to achieve increasing interpretability without destroying underlying semantic structure, and consequently without sacrificing performance in benchmark tests.\nUpon inspecting the 2nd column of Table TABREF14 , where qualitative results for concept TASTE are presented, another insight regarding the learning mechanism of our proposed approach can be made. Here it seems understandable that our proposed approach, along with GloVe, brought together the words taste and polish, and then the words Polish and, for instance, Warsaw are brought together by GloVe. These examples are interesting in that they shed insight into how GloVe works and the limitations posed by polysemy. It should be underlined that the present approach is not totally incapable of handling polysemy, but cannot do so perfectly. Since related words are being clustered, sufficiently well-connected words that do not meaningfully belong along with others will be appropriately \"pulled away\" from that group by several words, against the less effective, inappropriate pull of a particular word. Even though polish with lowercase \"p\" belongs where it is, it is attracting Warsaw to itself through polysemy and this is not meaningful. Perhaps because Warsaw is not a sufficiently well-connected word, it ends being dragged along, although words with greater connectedness to a concept group might have better resisted such inappropriate attractions.\nIn this study, we used the GloVe algorithm as the underlying dense word embedding scheme to demonstrate our approach. However, we stress that it is possible for our approach to be extended to other word embedding algorithms which have a learning routine consisting of iterations over cooccurrence records, by making suitable adjustments in the objective function. Since word2vec model is also based on the coocurrences of words in a sliding window through a large corpus, we expect that our approach can also be applied to word2vec after making suitable adjustments, which can be considered as an immediate future work for our approach. Although the semantic concepts are encoded in only one direction (positive) within the embedding dimensions, it might be beneficial to pursue future work that also encodes opposite concepts, such as good and bad, in two opposite directions of the same dimension.\nThe proposed methodology can also be helpful in computational cross-lingual studies, where the similarities are explored across the vector spaces of different languages BIBREF43 , BIBREF44 .","label":"longbench","length":7874,"title":"Introduction"}

MOPE, AT BANGOR,\nMAINE.\n\nSeptember 5th, 1879.\n\nMy dear mother--I have kept you posted as far as Tuesday week last, and,\nalthough my letter will not have reached you yet, I will begin another\nbefore my news accumulates too much.  I am glad you show my letters round\nin the family, for I like them all to know what I am doing, and I can't\nwrite to every one, though I try to answer all reasonable expectations.\nBut there are a great many unreasonable ones, as I suppose you know--not\nyours, dear mother, for I am bound to say that you never required of me\nmore than was natural.  You see you are reaping your reward: I write to\nyou before I write to any one else.\n\nThere is one thing, I hope--that you don't show any of my letters to\nWilliam Platt.  If he wants to see any of my letters, he knows the right\nway to go to work.  I wouldn't have him see one of these letters, written\nfor circulation in the family, for anything in the world.  If he wants\none for himself, he has got to write to me first.  Let him write to me\nfirst, and then I will see about answering him.  You can show him this if\nyou like; but if you show him anything more, I will never write to you\nagain.\n\nI told you in my last about my farewell to England, my crossing the\nChannel, and my first impressions of Paris.  I have thought a great deal\nabout that lovely England since I left it, and all the famous historic\nscenes I visited; but I have come to the conclusion that it is not a\ncountry in which I should care to reside.  The position of woman does not\nseem to me at all satisfactory, and that is a point, you know, on which I\nfeel very strongly.  It seems to me that in England they play a very\nfaded-out part, and those with whom I conversed had a kind of depressed\nand humiliated tone; a little dull, tame look, as if they were used to\nbeing snubbed and bullied, which made me want to give them a good\nshaking.  There are a great many people--and a great many things,\ntoo--over here that I should like to perform that operation upon.  I\nshould like to shake the starch out of some of them, and the dust out of\nthe others.  I know fifty girls in Bangor that come much more up to my\nnotion of the stand a truly noble woman should take, than those young\nladies in England.  But they had a most lovely way of speaking (in\nEngland), and the men are _remarkably handsome_.  (You can show this to\nWilliam Platt, if you like.)\n\nI gave you my first impressions of Paris, which quite came up to my\nexpectations, much as I had heard and read about it.  The objects of\ninterest are extremely numerous, and the climate is remarkably cheerful\nand sunny.  I should say the position of woman here was considerably\nhigher, though by no means coming up to the American standard.  The\nmanners of the people are in some respects extremely peculiar, and I feel\nat last that I am indeed in _foreign parts_.  It is, however, a truly\nelegant city (very superior to New York), and I have spent a great deal\nof time in visiting the various monuments and palaces.  I won't give you\nan account of all my wanderings, though I have been most indefatigable;\nfor I am keeping, as I told you before, a most _exhaustive_ journal,\nwhich I will allow you the _privilege_ of reading on my return to Bangor.\nI am getting on remarkably well, and I must say I am sometimes surprised\nat my universal good fortune.  It only shows what a little energy and\ncommon-sense will accomplish.  I have discovered none of these objections\nto a young lady travelling in Europe by herself of which we heard so much\nbefore I left, and I don't expect I ever shall, for I certainly don't\nmean to look for them.  I know what I want, and I always manage to get\nit.\n\nI have received a great deal of politeness--some of it really most\npressing, and I have experienced no drawbacks whatever.  I have made a\ngreat many pleasant acquaintances in travelling round (both ladies and\ngentlemen), and had a great many most interesting talks.  I have\ncollected a great deal of information, for which I refer you to my\njournal.  I assure you my journal is going to be a splendid thing.  I do\njust exactly as I do in Bangor, and I find I do perfectly right; and at\nany rate, I don't care if I don't.  I didn't come to Europe to lead a\nmerely conventional life; I could do that at Bangor.  You know I never\n_would_ do it at Bangor, so it isn't likely I am going to make myself\nmiserable over here.  So long as I accomplish what I desire, and make my\nmoney hold out, I shall regard the thing as a success.  Sometimes I feel\nrather lonely, especially in the evening; but I generally manage to\ninterest myself in something or in some one.  In the evening I usually\nread up about the objects of interest I have visited during the day, or I\npost up my journal.  Sometimes I go to the theatre; or else I play the\npiano in the public parlour.  The public parlour at the hotel isn't much;\nbut the piano is better than that fearful old thing at the Sebago House.\nSometimes I go downstairs and talk to the lady who keeps the books--a\nFrench lady, who is remarkably polite.  She is very pretty, and always\nwears a black dress, with the most beautiful fit; she speaks a little\nEnglish; she tells me she had to learn it in order to converse with the\nAmericans who come in such numbers to this hotel.  She has given me a\ngreat deal of information about the position of woman in France, and much\nof it is very encouraging.  But she has told me at the same time some\nthings that I should not like to write to you (I am hesitating even about\nputting them into my journal), especially if my letters are to be handed\nround in the family.  I assure you they appear to talk about things here\nthat we never think of mentioning at Bangor, or even of thinking about.\nShe seems to think she can tell me everything, because I told her I was\ntravelling for general culture.  Well, I _do_ want to know so much that\nit seems sometimes as if I wanted to know everything; and yet there are\nsome things that I think I don't want to know.  But, as a general thing,\neverything is intensely interesting; I don't mean only everything that\nthis French lady tells me, but everything I see and hear for myself.  I\nfeel really as if I should gain all I desire.\n\nI meet a great many Americans, who, as a general thing, I must say, are\nnot as polite to me as the people over here.  The people over\nhere--especially the gentlemen--are much more what I should call\n_attentive_.  I don't know whether Americans are more _sincere_; I\nhaven't yet made up my mind about that.  The only drawback I experience\nis when Americans sometimes express surprise that I should be travelling\nround alone; so you see it doesn't come from Europeans.  I always have my\nanswer ready; \"For general culture, to acquire the languages, and to see\nEurope for myself;\" and that generally seems to satisfy them.  Dear\nmother, my money holds out very well, and it _is_ real interesting.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nFROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.\n\nSeptember 16th.\n\nSince I last wrote to you I have left that hotel, and come to live in a\nFrench family.  It's a kind of boarding-house combined with a kind of\nschool; only it's not like an American hoarding-house, nor like an\nAmerican school either.  There are four or five people here that have\ncome to learn the language--not to take lessons, but to have an\nopportunity for conversation.  I was very glad to come to such a place,\nfor I had begun to realise that I was not making much progress with the\nFrench.  It seemed to me that I should feel ashamed to have spent two\nmonths in Paris, and not to have acquired more insight into the language.\nI had always heard so much of French conversation, and I found I was\nhaving no more opportunity to practise it than if I had remained at\nBangor.  In fact, I used to hear a great deal more at Bangor, from those\nFrench Canadians that came down to cut the ice, than I saw I should ever\nhear at that hotel.  The lady that kept the books seemed to want so much\nto talk to me in English (for the sake of practice, too, I suppose), that\nI couldn't bear to let her know I didn't like it.  The chambermaid was\nIrish, and all the waiters were German, so that I never heard a word of\nFrench spoken.  I suppose you might hear a great deal in the shops; only,\nas I don't buy anything--I prefer to spend my money for purposes of\nculture--I don't have that advantage.\n\nI have been thinking some of taking a teacher, but I am well acquainted\nwith the grammar already, and teachers always keep you bothering over the\nverbs.  I was a good deal troubled, for I felt as if I didn't want to go\naway without having, at least, got a general idea of French conversation.\nThe theatre gives you a good deal of insight, and as I told you in my\nlast, I go a good deal to places of amusement.  I find no difficulty\nwhatever in going to such places alone, and am always treated with the\npoliteness which, as I told you before, I encounter everywhere.  I see\nplenty of other ladies alone (mostly French), and they generally seem to\nbe enjoying themselves as much as I.  But at the theatre every one talks\nso fast that I can scarcely make out what they say; and, besides, there\nare a great many vulgar expressions which it is unnecessary to learn.  But\nit was the theatre, nevertheless, that put me on the track.  The very\nnext day after I wrote to you last I went to the Palais Royal, which is\none of the principal theatres in Paris.  It is very small, but it is very\ncelebrated, and in my guide-book it is marked with _two stars_, which is\na sign of importance attached only to _first-class_ objects of interest.\nBut after I had been there half an hour I found I couldn't understand a\nsingle word of the play, they gabbled it off so fast, and they made use\nof such peculiar expressions.  I felt a good deal disappointed and\ntroubled--I was afraid I shouldn't gain all I had come for.  But while I\nwas thinking it over--thinking what I _should_ do--I heard two gentlemen\ntalking behind me.  It was between the acts, and I couldn't help\nlistening to what they said.  They were talking English, but I guess they\nwere Americans.\n\n\"Well,\" said one of them, \"it all depends on what you are after.  I'm\nFrench; that's what I'm after.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"I'm after Art.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the first, \"I'm after Art too; but I'm after French most.\"\n\nThen, dear mother, I am sorry to say the second one swore a little.  He\nsaid, \"Oh, damn French!\"\n\n\"No, I won't damn French,\" said his friend.  \"I'll acquire it--that's\nwhat I'll do with it.  I'll go right into a family.\"\n\n\"What family'll you go into?\"\n\n\"Into some French family.  That's the only way to do--to go to some place\nwhere you can talk.  If you're after Art, you want to stick to the\ngalleries; you want to go right through the Louvre, room by room; you\nwant to take a room a day, or something of that sort.  But, if you want\nto acquire French, the thing is to look out for a family.  There are lots\nof French families here that take you to board and teach you.  My second\ncousin--that young lady I told you about--she got in with a crowd like\nthat, and they booked her right up in three months.  They just took her\nright in and they talked to her.  That's what they do to you; they set\nyou right down and they talk _at_ you.  You've got to understand them;\nyou can't help yourself.  That family my cousin was with has moved away\nsomewhere, or I should try and get in with them.  They were very smart\npeople, that family; after she left, my cousin corresponded with them in\nFrench.  But I mean to find some other crowd, if it takes a lot of\ntrouble!\"\n\nI listened to all this with great interest, and when he spoke about his\ncousin I was on the point of turning around to ask him the address of the\nfamily that she was with; but the next moment he said they had moved\naway; so I sat still.  The other gentleman, however, didn't seem to be\naffected in the same way as I was.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you may follow up that if you like; I mean to follow up\nthe pictures.  I don't believe there is ever going to be any considerable\ndemand in the United States for French; but I can promise you that in\nabout ten years there'll be a big demand for Art!  And it won't be\ntemporary either.\"\n\nThat remark may be very true, but I don't care anything about the demand;\nI want to know French for its own sake.  I don't want to think I have\nbeen all this while without having gained an insight . . . The very next\nday, I asked the lady who kept the books at the hotel whether she knew of\nany family that could take me to board and give me the benefit of their\nconversation.  She instantly threw up her hands, with several little\nshrill cries (in their French way, you know), and told me that her\ndearest friend kept a regular place of that kind.  If she had known I was\nlooking out for such a place she would have told me before; she had not\nspoken of it herself, because she didn't wish to injure the hotel by\nbeing the cause of my going away.  She told me this was a charming\nfamily, who had often received American ladies (and others as well) who\nwished to follow up the language, and she was sure I should be delighted\nwith them.  So she gave me their address, and offered to go with me to\nintroduce me.  But I was in such a hurry that I went off by myself; and I\nhad no trouble in finding these good people.  They were delighted to\nreceive me, and I was very much pleased with what I saw of them.  They\nseemed to have plenty of conversation, and there will be no trouble about\nthat.\n\nI came here to stay about three days ago, and by this time I have seen a\ngreat deal of them.  The price of board struck me as rather high; but I\nmust remember that a quantity of conversation is thrown in.  I have a\nvery pretty little room--without any carpet, but with seven mirrors, two\nclocks, and five curtains.  I was rather disappointed after I arrived to\nfind that there are several other Americans here for the same purpose as\nmyself.  At least there are three Americans and two English people; and\nalso a German gentleman.  I am afraid, therefore, our conversation will\nbe rather mixed, but I have not yet time to judge.  I try to talk with\nMadame de Maisonrouge all I can (she is the lady of the house, and the\n_real_ family consists only of herself and her two daughters).  They are\nall most elegant, interesting women, and I am sure we shall become\nintimate friends.  I will write you more about them in my next.  Tell\nWilliam Platt I don't care what he does.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nFROM MISS VIOLET RAY, IN PARIS, TO MISS AGNES RICH, IN NEW YORK.\n\nSeptember 21st.\n\nWe had hardly got here when father received a telegram saying he would\nhave to come right back to New York.  It was for something about his\nbusiness--I don't know exactly what; you know I never understand those\nthings, never want to.  We had just got settled at the hotel, in some\ncharming rooms, and mother and I, as you may imagine, were greatly\nannoyed.  Father is extremely fussy, as you know, and his first idea, as\nsoon as he found he should have to go back, was that we should go back\nwith him.  He declared he would never leave us in Paris alone, and that\nwe must return and come out again.  I don't know what he thought would\nhappen to us; I suppose he thought we should be too extravagant.  It's\nfather's theory that we are always running up bills, whereas a little\nobservation would show him that we wear the same old _rags_ FOR MONTHS.\nBut father has no observation; he has nothing but theories.  Mother and\nI, however, have, fortunately, a great deal of _practice_, and we\nsucceeded in making him understand that we wouldn't budge from Paris, and\nthat we would rather be chopped into small pieces than cross that\ndreadful ocean again.  So, at last, he decided to go back alone, and to\nleave us here for three months.  But, to show you how fussy he is, he\nrefused to let us stay at the hotel, and insisted that we should go into\na _family_.  I don't know what put such an idea into his head, unless it\nwas some advertisement that he saw in one of the American papers that are\npublished here.\n\nThere are families here who receive American and English people to live\nwith them, under the pretence of teaching them French.  You may imagine\nwhat people they are--I mean the families themselves.  But the Americans\nwho choose this peculiar manner of seeing Paris must be actually just as\nbad.  Mother and I were horrified, and declared that main force should\nnot remove us from the hotel.  But father has a way of arriving at his\nends which is more efficient than violence.  He worries and fusses; he\n\"nags,\" as we used to say at school; and, when mother and I are quite\nworn out, his triumph is assured.  Mother is usually worn out more easily\nthan I, and she ends by siding with father; so that, at last, when they\ncombine their forces against poor little me, I have to succumb.  You\nshould have heard the way father went on about this \"family\" plan; he\ntalked to every one he saw about it; he used to go round to the banker's\nand talk to the people there--the people in the post-office; he used to\ntry and exchange ideas about it with the waiters at the hotel.  He said\nit would be more safe, more respectable, more economical; that I should\nperfect my French; that mother would learn how a French household is\nconducted; that he should feel more easy, and five hundred reasons more.\nThey were none of them good, but that made no difference.  It's all\nhumbug, his talking about economy, when every one knows that business in\nAmerica has completely recovered, that the prostration is all over, and\nthat immense fortunes are being made.  We have been economising for the\nlast five years, and I supposed we came abroad to reap the benefits of\nit.\n\nAs for my French, it is quite as perfect as I want it to be.  (I assure\nyou I am often surprised at my own fluency, and, when I get a little more\npractice in the genders and the idioms, I shall do very well in this\nrespect.)  To make a long story short, however, father carried his point,\nas usual; mother basely deserted me at the last moment, and, after\nholding out alone for three days, I told them to do with me what they\npleased!  Father lost three steamers in succession by remaining in Paris\nto argue with me.  You know he is like the schoolmaster in Goldsmith's\n\"Deserted Village\"--\"e'en though vanquished, he would argue still.\" He\nand mother went to look at some seventeen families (they had got the\naddresses somewhere), while I retired to my sofa, and would have nothing\nto do with it.  At last they made arrangements, and I was transported to\nthe establishment from which I now write you.  I write you from the bosom\nof a Parisian menage--from the depths of a second-rate boarding-house.\n\nFather only left Paris after he had seen us what he calls comfortably\nsettled here, and had informed Madame de Maisonrouge (the mistress of the\nestablishment--the head of the \"family\") that he wished my French\npronunciation especially attended to.  The pronunciation, as it happens,\nis just what I am most at home in; if he had said my genders or my idioms\nthere would have been some sense.  But poor father has no tact, and this\ndefect is especially marked since he has been in Europe.  He will be\nabsent, however, for three months, and mother and I shall breathe more\nfreely; the situation will be less intense.  I must confess that we\nbreathe more freely than I expected, in this place, where we have been\nfor about a week.  I was sure, before we came, that it would prove to be\nan establishment of the _lowest description_; but I must say that, in\nthis respect, I am agreeably disappointed.  The French are so clever that\nthey know even how to manage a place of this kind.  Of course it is very\ndisagreeable to live with strangers, but as, after all, if I were not\nstaying with Madame de Maisonrouge I should not be living in the Faubourg\nSt. Germain, I don't know that from the point of view of exclusiveness it\nis any great loss to be here.\n\nOur rooms are very prettily arranged, and the table is remarkably good.\nMamma thinks the whole thing--the place and the people, the manners and\ncustoms--very amusing; but mamma is very easily amused.  As for me, you\nknow, all that I ask is to be let alone, and not to have people's society\nforced upon me.  I have never wanted for society of my own choosing, and,\nso long as I retain possession of my faculties, I don't suppose I ever\nshall.  As I said, however, the place is very well managed, and I succeed\nin doing as I please, which, you know, is my most cherished pursuit.\nMadame de Maisonrouge has a great deal of tact--much more than poor\nfather.  She is what they call here a belle femme, which means that she\nis a tall, ugly woman, with style.  She dresses very well, and has a\ngreat deal of talk; but, though she is a very good imitation of a lady, I\nnever see her behind the dinner-table, in the evening, smiling and\nbowing, as the people come in, and looking all the while at the dishes\nand the servants, without thinking of a _dame de comptoir_ blooming in a\ncorner of a shop or a restaurant.  I am sure that, in spite of her fine\nname, she was once a _dame de comptoir_.  I am also sure that, in spite\nof her smiles and the pretty things she says to every one, she hates us\nall, and would like to murder us.  She is a hard, clever Frenchwoman, who\nwould like to amuse herself and enjoy her Paris, and she must be bored to\ndeath at passing all her time in the midst of stupid English people who\nmumble broken French at her.  Some day she will poison the soup or the\n_vin rouge_; but I hope that will not be until after mother and I shall\nhave left her.  She has two daughters, who, except that one is decidedly\npretty, are meagre imitations of herself.\n\nThe \"family,\" for the rest, consists altogether of our beloved\ncompatriots, and of still more beloved Englanders.  There is an\nEnglishman here, with his sister, and they seem to be rather nice people.\nHe is remarkably handsome, but excessively affected and patronising,\nespecially to us Americans; and I hope to have a chance of biting his\nhead off before long.  The sister is very pretty, and, apparently, very\nnice; but, in costume, she is Britannia incarnate.  There is a very\npleasant little Frenchman--when they are nice they are charming--and a\nGerman doctor, a big blonde man, who looks like a great white bull; and\ntwo Americans, besides mother and me.  One of them is a young man from\nBoston,--an aesthetic young man, who talks about its being \"a real Corot\nday,\" etc., and a young woman--a girl, a female, I don't know what to\ncall her--from Vermont, or Minnesota, or some such place.  This young\nwoman is the most extraordinary specimen of artless Yankeeism that I ever\nencountered; she is really too horrible.  I have been three times to\nClementine about your underskirt, etc.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nFROM LOUIS LEVERETT, IN PARIS, TO HARVARD TREMONT, IN BOSTON.\n\nSeptember 25th.\n\nMy dear Harvard--I have carried out my plan, of which I gave you a hint\nin my last, and I only regret that I should not have done it before.  It\nis human nature, after all, that is the most interesting thing in the\nworld, and it only reveals itself to the truly earnest seeker.  There is\na want of earnestness in that life of hotels and railroad trains, which\nso many of our countrymen are content to lead in this strange Old World,\nand I was distressed to find how far I, myself; had been led along the\ndusty, beaten track.  I had, however, constantly wanted to turn aside\ninto more unfrequented ways; to plunge beneath the surface and see what I\nshould discover.  But the opportunity had always been missing; somehow, I\nnever meet those opportunities that we hear about and read about--the\nthings that happen to people in novels and biographies.  And yet I am\nalways on the watch to take advantage of any opening that may present\nitself; I am always looking out for experiences, for sensations--I might\nalmost say for adventures.\n\nThe great thing is to _live_, you know--to feel, to be conscious of one's\npossibilities; not to pass through life mechanically and insensibly, like\na letter through the post-office.  There are times, my dear Harvard, when\nI feel as if I were really capable of everything--capable _de tout_, as\nthey say here--of the greatest excesses as well as the greatest heroism.\nOh, to be able to say that one has lived--_qu'on a vecu_, as they say\nhere--that idea exercises an indefinable attraction for me.  You will,\nperhaps, reply, it is easy to say it; but the thing is to make people\nbelieve you!  And, then, I don't want any second-hand, spurious\nsensations; I want the knowledge that leaves a trace--that leaves strange\nscars and stains and reveries behind it!  But I am afraid I shock you,\nperhaps even frighten you.\n\nIf you repeat my remarks to any of the West Cedar Street circle, be sure\nyou tone them down as your discretion will suggest.  For yourself; you\nwill know that I have always had an intense desire to see something of\n_real French life_.  You are acquainted with my great sympathy with the\nFrench; with my natural tendency to enter into the French way of looking\nat life.  I sympathise with the artistic temperament; I remember you used\nsometimes to hint to me that you thought my own temperament too artistic.\nI don't think that in Boston there is any real sympathy with the artistic\ntemperament; we tend to make everything a matter of right and wrong.  And\nin Boston one can't _live--on ne peut pas vivre_, as they say here.  I\ndon't mean one can't reside--for a great many people manage that; but one\ncan't live aesthetically--I may almost venture to say, sensuously.  This\nis why I have always been so much drawn to the French, who are so\naesthetic, so sensuous.  I am so sorry that Theophile Gautier has passed\naway; I should have liked so much to go and see him, and tell him all\nthat I owe him.  He was living when I was here before; but, you know, at\nthat time I was travelling with the Johnsons, who are not aesthetic, and\nwho used to make me feel rather ashamed of my artistic temperament.  If I\nhad gone to see the great apostle of beauty, I should have had to go\nclandestinely--_en cachette_, as they say here; and that is not my\nnature; I like to do everything frankly, freely, _naivement, au grand\njour_.  That is the great thing--to be free, to be frank, to be _naif_.\nDoesn't Matthew Arnold say that somewhere--or is it Swinburne, or Pater?\n\nWhen I was with the Johnsons everything was superficial; and, as regards\nlife, everything was brought down to the question of right and wrong.\nThey were too didactic; art should never be didactic; and what is life\nbut an art?  Pater has said that so well, somewhere.  With the Johnsons I\nam afraid I lost many opportunities; the tone was gray and cottony, I\nmight almost say woolly.  But now, as I tell you, I have determined to\ntake right hold for myself; to look right into European life, and judge\nit without Johnsonian prejudices.  I have taken up my residence in a\nFrench family, in a real Parisian house.  You see I have the courage of\nmy opinions; I don't shrink from carrying out my theory that the great\nthing is to _live_.\n\nYou know I have always been intensely interested in Balzac, who never\nshrank from the reality, and whose almost _lurid_ pictures of Parisian\nlife have often haunted me in my wanderings through the old\nwicked-looking streets on the other side of the river.  I am only sorry\nthat my new friends--my French family--do not live in the old city--_au\ncoeur du vieux Paris_, as they say here.  They live only in the Boulevard\nHaussman, which is less picturesque; but in spite of this they have a\ngreat deal of the Balzac tone.  Madame de Maisonrouge belongs to one of\nthe oldest and proudest families in France; but she has had reverses\nwhich have compelled her to open an establishment in which a limited\nnumber of travellers, who are weary of the beaten track, who have the\nsense of local colour--she explains it herself; she expresses it so\nwell--in short, to open a sort of boarding-house.  I don't see why I\nshould not, after all, use that expression, for it is the correlative of\nthe term _pension bourgeoise_, employed by Balzac in the _Pere Goriot_.\nDo you remember the _pension bourgeoise_ of Madame Vauquer _nee_ de\nConflans?  But this establishment is not at all like that: and indeed it\nis not at all _bourgeois_; there is something distinguished, something\naristocratic, about it.  The Pension Vauquer was dark, brown, sordid,\n_graisseuse_; but this is in quite a different tone, with high, clear,\nlightly-draped windows, tender, subtle, almost morbid, colours, and\nfurniture in elegant, studied, reed-like lines.  Madame de Maisonrouge\nreminds me of Madame Hulot--do you remember \"la belle Madame Hulot?\"--in\n_Les Barents Pauvres_.  She has a great charm; a little artificial, a\nlittle fatigued, with a little suggestion of hidden things in her life;\nbut I have always been sensitive to the charm of fatigue, of duplicity.\n\nI am rather disappointed, I confess, in the society I find here; it is\nnot so local, so characteristic, as I could have desired.  Indeed, to\ntell the truth, it is not local at all; but, on the other hand, it is\ncosmopolitan, and there is a great advantage in that.  We are French, we\nare English, we are American, we are German; and, I believe, there are\nsome Russians and Hungarians expected.  I am much interested in the study\nof national types; in comparing, contrasting, seizing the strong points,\nthe weak points, the point of view of each.  It is interesting to shift\none's point of view--to enter into strange, exotic ways of looking at\nlife.\n\nThe American types here are not, I am sorry to say, so interesting as\nthey might be, and, excepting myself; are exclusively feminine.  We are\n_thin_, my dear Harvard; we are pale, we are sharp.  There is something\nmeagre about us; our line is wanting in roundness, our composition in\nrichness.  We lack temperament; we don't know how to live; _nous ne\nsavons pas vivre_, as they say here.  The American temperament is\nrepresented (putting myself aside, and I often think that my temperament\nis not at all American) by a young girl and her mother, and another young\ngirl without her mother--without her mother or any attendant or appendage\nwhatever.  These young girls are rather curious types; they have a\ncertain interest, they have a certain grace, but they are disappointing\ntoo; they don't go far; they don't keep all they promise; they don't\nsatisfy the imagination.  They are cold, slim, sexless; the physique is\nnot generous, not abundant; it is only the drapery, the skirts and\nfurbelows (that is, I mean in the young lady who has her mother) that are\nabundant.  They are very different: one of them all elegance, all\nexpensiveness, with an air of high fashion, from New York; the other a\nplain, pure, clear-eyed, straight-waisted, straight-stepping maiden from\nthe heart of New England.  And yet they are very much alike too--more\nalike than they would care to think themselves for they eye each other\nwith cold, mistrustful, deprecating looks.  They are both specimens of\nthe emancipated young American girl--practical, positive, passionless,\nsubtle, and knowing, as you please, either too much or too little.  And\nyet, as I say, they have a certain stamp, a certain grace; I like to talk\nwith them, to study them.\n\nThe fair New Yorker is, sometimes, very amusing; she asks me if every one\nin Boston talks like me--if every one is as \"intellectual\" as your poor\ncorrespondent.  She is for ever throwing Boston up at me; I can't get rid\nof Boston.  The other one rubs it into me too; but in a different way;\nshe seems to feel about it as a good Mahommedan feels toward Mecca, and\nregards it as a kind of focus of light for the whole human race.  Poor\nlittle Boston, what nonsense is talked in thy name!  But this New England\nmaiden is, in her way, a strange type: she is travelling all over Europe\nalone--\"to see it,\" she says, \"for herself.\"  For herself!  What can that\nstiff slim self of hers do with such sights, such visions!  She looks at\neverything, goes everywhere, passes her way, with her clear quiet eyes\nwide open; skirting the edge of obscene abysses without suspecting them;\npushing through brambles without tearing her robe; exciting, without\nknowing it, the most injurious suspicions; and always holding her course,\npassionless, stainless, fearless, charmless!  It is a little figure in\nwhich, after all, if you can get the right point of view, there is\nsomething rather striking.\n\nBy way of contrast, there is a lovely English girl, with eyes as shy as\nviolets, and a voice as sweet!  She has a sweet Gainsborough head, and a\ngreat Gainsborough hat, with a mighty plume in front of it, which makes a\nshadow over her quiet English eyes.  Then she has a sage-green robe,\n\"mystic, wonderful,\" all embroidered with subtle devices and flowers, and\nbirds of tender tint; very straight and tight in front, and adorned\nbehind, along the spine, with large, strange, iridescent buttons.  The\nrevival of taste, of the sense of beauty, in England, interests me\ndeeply; what is there in a simple row of spinal buttons to make one\ndream--to _donnor a rever_, as they say here?  I think that a great\naesthetic renascence is at hand, and that a great light will be kindled\nin England, for all the world to see.  There are spirits there that I\nshould like to commune with; I think they would understand me.\n\nThis gracious English maiden, with her clinging robes, her amulets and\ngirdles, with something quaint and angular in her step, her carriage\nsomething mediaeval and Gothic, in the details of her person and dress,\nthis lovely Evelyn Vane (isn't it a beautiful name?) is deeply,\ndelightfully picturesque.  She is much a woman--elle _est bien femme_, as\nthey say here; simpler, softer, rounder, richer than the young girls I\nspoke of just now.  Not much talk--a great, sweet silence.  Then the\nviolet eye--the very eye itself seems to blush; the great shadowy hat,\nmaking the brow so quiet; the strange, clinging, clutching, pictured\nraiment!  As I say, it is a very gracious, tender type.  She has her\nbrother with her, who is a beautiful, fair-haired, gray-eyed young\nEnglishman.  He is purely objective; and he, too, is very plastic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nFROM MIRANDA HOPE TO HER MOTHER.\n\nSeptember 26th.\n\nYou must not be frightened at not hearing from me oftener; it is not\nbecause I am in any trouble, but because I am getting on so well.  If I\nwere in any trouble I don't think I should write to you; I should just\nkeep quiet and see it through myself.  But that is not the case at\npresent and, if I don't write to you, it is because I am so deeply\ninterested over here that I don't seem to find time.  It was a real\nprovidence that brought me to this house, where, in spite of all\nobstacles, I am able to do much good work.  I wonder how I find the time\nfor all I do; but when I think that I have only got a year in Europe, I\nfeel as if I wouldn't sacrifice a single hour.\n\nThe obstacles I refer to are the disadvantages I have in learning French,\nthere being so many persons around me speaking English, and that, as you\nmay say, in the very bosom of a French family.  It seems as if you heard\nEnglish everywhere; but I certainly didn't expect to find it in a place\nlike this.  I am not discouraged, however, and I talk French all I can,\neven with the other English boarders.  Then I have a lesson every day\nfrom Miss Maisonrouge (the elder daughter of the lady of the house), and\nFrench conversation every evening in the salon, from eight to eleven,\nwith Madame herself, and some friends of hers that often come in.  Her\ncousin, Mr. Verdier, a young French gentleman, is fortunately staying\nwith her, and I make a point of talking with him as much as possible.  I\nhave _extra private lessons_ from him, and I often go out to walk with\nhim.  Some night, soon, he is to accompany me to the opera.  We have also\na most interesting plan of visiting all the galleries in Paris together.\nLike most of the French, he converses with great fluency, and I feel as\nif I should really gain from him.  He is remarkably handsome, and\nextremely polite--paying a great many compliments, which, I am afraid,\nare not always _sincere_.  When I return to Bangor I will tell you some\nof the things he has said to me.  I think you will consider them\nextremely curious, and very beautiful _in their way_.\n\nThe conversation in the parlour (from eight to eleven) is often\nremarkably brilliant, and I often wish that you, or some of the Bangor\nfolks, could be there to enjoy it.  Even though you couldn't understand\nit I think you would like to hear the way they go on; they seem to\nexpress so much.  I sometimes think that at Bangor they don't express\nenough (but it seems as if over there, there was less to express).  It\nseems as if; at Bangor, there were things that folks never _tried_ to\nsay; but here, I have learned from studying French that you have no idea\nwhat you _can_ say, before you try.  At Bangor they seem to give it up\nbeforehand; they don't make any effort.  (I don't say this in the least\nfor William Platt, _in particular_.)\n\nI am sure I don't know what they will think of me when I get back.  It\nseems as if; over here, I had learned to come out with everything.  I\nsuppose they will think I am not sincere; but isn't it more sincere to\ncome out with things than to conceal them?  I have become very good\nfriends with every one in the house--that is (you see, I _am_ sincere),\nwith _almost_ every one.  It is the most interesting circle I ever was\nin.  There's a girl here, an American, that I don't like so much as the\nrest; but that is only because she won't let me.  I should like to like\nher, ever so much, because she is most lovely and most attractive; but\nshe doesn't seem to want to know me or to like me.  She comes from New\nYork, and she is remarkably pretty, with beautiful eyes and the most\ndelicate features; she is also remarkably elegant--in this respect would\nbear comparison with any one I have seen over here.  But it seems as if\nshe didn't want to recognise me or associate with me; as if she wanted to\nmake a difference between us.  It is like people they call \"haughty\" in\nbooks.  I have never seen any one like that before--any one that wanted\nto make a difference; and at first I was right down interested, she\nseemed to me so like a proud young lady in a novel.  I kept saying to\nmyself all day, \"haughty, haughty,\" and I wished she would keep on so.\nBut she did keep on; she kept on too long; and then I began to feel hurt.\nI couldn't think what I have done, and I can't think yet.  It's as if she\nhad got some idea about me, or had heard some one say something.  If some\ngirls should behave like that I shouldn't make any account of it; but\nthis one is so refined, and looks as if she might be so interesting if I\nonce got to know her, that I think about it a good deal.  I am bound to\nfind out what her reason is--for of course she has got some reason; I am\nright down curious to know.\n\nI went up to her to ask her the day before yesterday; I thought that was\nthe best way.  I told her I wanted to know her better, and would like to\ncome and see her in her room--they tell me she has got a lovely room--and\nthat if she had heard anything against me, perhaps she would tell me when\nI came.  But she was more distant than ever, and she just turned it off;\nsaid that she had never heard me mentioned, and that her room was too\nsmall to receive visitors.  I suppose she spoke the truth, but I am sure\nshe has got some reason, all the same.  She has got some idea, and I am\nbound to find out before I go, if I have to ask everybody in the house.  I\n_am_ right down curious.  I wonder if she doesn't think me refined--or if\nshe had ever heard anything against Bangor?  I can't think it is that.\nDon't you remember when Clara Barnard went to visit New York, three years\nago, how much attention she received?  And you know Clara _is_ Bangor, to\nthe soles of her shoes.  Ask William Platt--so long as he isn't a\nnative--if he doesn't consider Clara Barnard refined.\n\nApropos, as they say here, of refinement, there is another American in\nthe house--a gentleman from Boston--who is just crowded with it.  His\nname is Mr. Louis Leverett (such a beautiful name, I think), and he is\nabout thirty years old.  He is rather small, and he looks pretty sick; he\nsuffers from some affection of the liver.  But his conversation is\nremarkably interesting, and I delight to listen to him--he has such\nbeautiful ideas.  I feel as if it were hardly right, not being in French;\nbut, fortunately, he uses a great many French expressions.  It's in a\ndifferent style from the conversation of Mr. Verdier--not so\ncomplimentary, but more intellectual.  He is intensely fond of pictures,\nand has given me a great many ideas about them which I should never have\ngained without him; I shouldn't have known where to look for such ideas.\nHe thinks everything of pictures; he thinks we don't make near enough of\nthem.  They seem to make a good deal of them here; but I couldn't help\ntelling him the other day that in Bangor I really don't think we do.\n\nIf I had any money to spend I would buy some and take them back, to hang\nup.  Mr. Leverett says it would do them good--not the pictures, but the\nBangor folks.  He thinks everything of the French, too, and says we don't\nmake nearly enough of _them_.  I couldn't help telling him the other day\nthat at any rate they make enough of themselves.  But it is very\ninteresting to hear him go on about the French, and it is so much gain to\nme, so long as that is what I came for.  I talk to him as much as I dare\nabout Boston, but I do feel as if this were right down wrong--a stolen\npleasure.\n\nI can get all the Boston culture I want when I go back, if I carry out my\nplan, my happy vision, of going there to reside.  I ought to direct all\nmy efforts to European culture now, and keep Boston to finish off.  But\nit seems as if I couldn't help taking a peep now and then, in\nadvance--with a Bostonian.  I don't know when I may meet one again; but\nif there are many others like Mr. Leverett there, I shall be certain not\nto want when I carry out my dream.  He is just as full of culture as he\ncan live.  But it seems strange how many different sorts there are.\n\nThere are two of the English who I suppose are very cultivated too; but\nit doesn't seem as if I could enter into theirs so easily, though I try\nall I can.  I do love their way of speaking, and sometimes I feel almost\nas if it would be right to give up trying to learn French, and just try\nto learn to speak our own tongue as these English speak it.  It isn't the\nthings they say so much, though these are often rather curious, but it is\nin the way they pronounce, and the sweetness of their voice.  It seems as\nif they must _try_ a good deal to talk like that; but these English that\nare here don't seem to try at all, either to speak or do anything else.\nThey are a young lady and her brother.  I believe they belong to some\nnoble family.  I have had a good deal of intercourse with them, because I\nhave felt more free to talk to them than to the Americans--on account of\nthe language.  It seems as if in talking with them I was almost learning\na new one.\n\nI never supposed, when I left Bangor, that I was coming to Europe to\nlearn _English_!  If I do learn it, I don't think you will understand me\nwhen I get back, and I don't think you'll like it much.  I should be a\ngood deal criticised if I spoke like that at Bangor.  However, I verily\nbelieve Bangor is the most critical place on earth; I have seen nothing\nlike it over here.  Tell them all I have come to the conclusion that they\nare _a great deal too fastidious_.  But I was speaking about this English\nyoung lady and her brother.  I wish I could put them before you.  She is\nlovely to look at; she seems so modest and retiring.  In spite of this,\nhowever, she dresses in a way that attracts great attention, as I\ncouldn't help noticing when one day I went out to walk with her.  She was\never so much looked at; but she didn't seem to notice it, until at last I\ncouldn't help calling attention to it.  Mr. Leverett thinks everything of\nit; he calls it the \"costume of the future.\"  I should call it rather the\ncostume of the past--you know the English have such an attachment to the\npast.  I said this the other day to Madame do Maisonrouge--that Miss Vane\ndressed in the costume of the past.  _De l'an passe, vous voulez dire_?\nsaid Madame, with her little French laugh (you can get William Platt to\ntranslate this, he used to tell me he knew so much French).\n\nYou know I told you, in writing some time ago, that I had tried to get\nsome insight into the position of woman in England, and, being here with\nMiss Vane, it has seemed to me to be a good opportunity to get a little\nmore.  I have asked her a great deal about it; but she doesn't seem able\nto give me much information.  The first time I asked her she told me the\nposition of a lady depended upon the rank of her father, her eldest\nbrother, her husband, etc.  She told me her own position was very good,\nbecause her father was some relation--I forget what--to a lord.  She\nthinks everything of this; and that proves to me that the position of\nwoman in her country cannot be satisfactory; because, if it were, it\nwouldn't depend upon that of your relations, even your nearest.  I don't\nknow much about lords, and it does try my patience (though she is just as\nsweet as she can live) to hear her talk as if it were a matter of course\nthat I should.\n\nI feel as if it were right to ask her as often as I can if she doesn't\nconsider every one equal; but she always says she doesn't, and she\nconfesses that she doesn't think she is equal to \"Lady\nSomething-or-other,\" who is the wife of that relation of her father.  I\ntry and persuade her all I can that she is; but it seems as if she didn't\nwant to be persuaded; and when I ask her if Lady So-and-so is of the same\nopinion (that Miss Vane isn't her equal), she looks so soft and pretty\nwith her eyes, and says, \"Of course she is!\"  When I tell her that this\nis right down bad for Lady So-and-so, it seems as if she wouldn't believe\nme, and the only answer she will make is that Lady So-and-so is\n\"extremely nice.\"  I don't believe she is nice at all; if she were nice,\nshe wouldn't have such ideas as that.  I tell Miss Vane that at Bangor we\nthink such ideas vulgar; but then she looks as though she had never heard\nof Bangor.  I often want to shake her, though she _is_ so sweet.  If she\nisn't angry with the people who make her feel that way, I am angry for\nher.  I am angry with her brother too, for she is evidently very much\nafraid of him, and this gives me some further insight into the subject.\nShe thinks everything of her brother, and thinks it natural that she\nshould be afraid of him, not only physically (for this _is_ natural, as\nhe is enormously tall and strong, and has very big fists), but morally\nand intellectually.  She seems unable, however, to take in any argument,\nand she makes me realise what I have often heard--that if you are timid\nnothing will reason you out of it.\n\nMr. Vane, also (the brother), seems to have the same prejudices, and when\nI tell him, as I often think it right to do, that his sister is not his\nsubordinate, even if she does think so, but his equal, and, perhaps in\nsome respects his superior, and that if my brother, in Bangor, were to\ntreat me as he treates this poor young girl, who has not spirit enough to\nsee the question in its true light, there would be an indignation,\nmeeting of the citizens to protest against such an outrage to the\nsanctity of womanhood--when I tell him all this, at breakfast or dinner,\nhe bursts out laughing so loud that all the plates clatter on the table.\n\nBut at such a time as this there is always one person who seems\ninterested in what I say--a German gentleman, a professor, who sits next\nto me at dinner, and whom I must tell you more about another time.  He is\nvery learned, and has a great desire for information; he appreciates a\ngreat many of my remarks, and after dinner, in the salon, he often comes\nto me to ask me questions about them.  I have to think a little,\nsometimes, to know what I did say, or what I do think.  He takes you\nright up where you left off; and he is almost as fond of discussing\nthings as William Platt is.  He is splendidly educated, in the German\nstyle, and he told me the other day that he was an \"intellectual broom.\"\nWell, if he is, he sweeps clean; I told him that.  After he has been\ntalking to me I feel as if I hadn't got a speck of dust left in my mind\nanywhere.  It's a most delightful feeling.  He says he's an observer; and\nI am sure there is plenty over here to observe.  But I have told you\nenough for to-day.  I don't know how much longer I shall stay here; I am\ngetting on so fast that it sometimes seems as if I shouldn't need all the\ntime I have laid out.  I suppose your cold weather has promptly begun, as\nusual; it sometimes makes me envy you.  The fall weather here is very\ndull and damp, and I feel very much as if I should like to be braced up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nFROM MISS EVELYN VANE, IN PARIS, TO THE LADY AUGUSTA FLEMING, AT\nBRIGHTON.\n\nParis, September 30th.\n\nDear Lady Augusta--I am afraid I shall not be able to come to you on\nJanuary 7th, as you kindly proposed at Homburg.  I am so very, very\nsorry; it is a great disappointment to me.  But I have just heard that it\nhas been settled that mamma and the children are coming abroad for a part\nof the winter, and mamma wishes me to go with them to Hyeres, where\nGeorgina has been ordered for her lungs.  She has not been at all well\nthese three months, and now that the damp weather has begun she is very\npoorly indeed; so that last week papa decided to have a consultation, and\nhe and mamma went with her up to town and saw some three or four doctors.\nThey all of them ordered the south of France, but they didn't agree about\nthe place; so that mamma herself decided for Hyeres, because it is the\nmost economical.  I believe it is very dull, but I hope it will do\nGeorgina good.  I am afraid, however, that nothing will do her good until\nshe consents to take more care of herself; I am afraid she is very wild\nand wilful, and mamma tells me that all this month it has taken papa's\npositive orders to make her stop in-doors.  She is very cross (mamma\nwrites me) about coming abroad, and doesn't seem at all to mind the\nexpense that papa has been put to--talks very ill-naturedly about losing\nthe hunting, etc.  She expected to begin to hunt in December, and wants\nto know whether anybody keeps hounds at Hyeres.  Fancy a girl wanting to\nfollow the hounds when her lungs are so bad!  But I daresay that when she\ngets there she will he glad enough to keep quiet, as they say that the\nheat is intense.  It may cure Georgina, but I am sure it will make the\nrest of us very ill.\n\nMamma, however, is only going to bring Mary and Gus and Fred and Adelaide\nabroad with her; the others will remain at Kingscote until February\n(about the 3d), when they will go to Eastbourne for a month with Miss\nTurnover, the new governess, who has turned out such a very nice person.\nShe is going to take Miss Travers, who has been with us so long, but who\nis only qualified for the younger children, to Hyeres, and I believe some\nof the Kingscote servants.  She has perfect confidence in Miss T.; it is\nonly a pity she has such an odd name.  Mamma thought of asking her if she\nwould mind taking another when she came; but papa thought she might\nobject.  Lady Battledown makes all her governesses take the same name;\nshe gives 5 pounds more a year for the purpose.  I forget what it is she\ncalls them; I think it's Johnson (which to me always suggests a lady's\nmaid).  Governesses shouldn't have too pretty a name; they shouldn't have\na nicer name than the family.\n\nI suppose you heard from the Desmonds that I did not go back to England\nwith them.  When it began to be talked about that Georgina should be\ntaken abroad, mamma wrote to me that I had better stop in Paris for a\nmonth with Harold, so that she could pick me up on their way to Hyeres.\nIt saves the expense of my journey to Kingscote and back, and gives me\nthe opportunity to \"finish\" a little in French.\n\nYou know Harold came here six weeks ago, to get up his French for those\ndreadful examinations that he has to pass so soon.  He came to live with\nsome French people that take in young men (and others) for this purpose;\nit's a kind of coaching place, only kept by women.  Mamma had heard it\nwas very nice; so she wrote to me that I was to come and stop here with\nHarold.  The Desmonds brought me and made the arrangement, or the\nbargain, or whatever you call it.  Poor Harold was naturally not at all\npleased; but he has been very kind, and has treated me like an angel.  He\nis getting on beautifully with his French; for though I don't think the\nplace is so good as papa supposed, yet Harold is so immensely clever that\nhe can scarcely help learning.  I am afraid I learn much less, but,\nfortunately, I have not to pass an examination--except if mamma takes it\ninto her head to examine me.  But she will have so much to think of with\nGeorgina that I hope this won't occur to her.  If it does, I shall be, as\nHarold says, in a dreadful funk.\n\nThis is not such a nice place for a girl as for a young man, and the\nDesmonds thought it _exceedingly odd_ that mamma should wish me to come\nhere.  As Mrs. Desmond said, it is because she is so very unconventional.\nBut you know Paris is so very amusing, and if only Harold remains good-\nnatured about it, I shall be content to wait for the caravan (that's what\nhe calls mamma and the children).  The person who keeps the\nestablishment, or whatever they call it, is rather odd, and _exceedingly\nforeign_; but she is wonderfully civil, and is perpetually sending to my\ndoor to see if I want anything.  The servants are not at all like English\nservants, and come bursting in, the footman (they have only one) and the\nmaids alike, at all sorts of hours, in the _most sudden way_.  Then when\none rings, it is half an hour before they come.  All this is very\nuncomfortable, and I daresay it will be worse at Hyeres.  There, however,\nfortunately, we shall have our own people.\n\nThere are some very odd Americans here, who keep throwing Harold into\nfits of laughter.  One is a dreadful little man who is always sitting\nover the fire, and talking about the colour of the sky.  I don't believe\nhe ever saw the sky except through the window--pane.  The other day he\ntook hold of my frock (that green one you thought so nice at Homburg) and\ntold me that it reminded him of the texture of the Devonshire turf.  And\nthen he talked for half an hour about the Devonshire turf; which I\nthought such a very extraordinary subject.  Harold says he is mad.  It is\nvery strange to be living in this way with people one doesn't know.  I\nmean that one doesn't know as one knows them in England.\n\nThe other Americans (beside the madman) are two girls, about my own age,\none of whom is rather nice.  She has a mother; but the mother is always\nsitting in her bedroom, which seems so very odd.  I should like mamma to\nask them to Kingscote, but I am afraid mamma wouldn't like the mother,\nwho is rather vulgar.  The other girl is rather vulgar too, and is\ntravelling about quite alone.  I think she is a kind of schoolmistress;\nbut the other girl (I mean the nicer one, with the mother) tells me she\nis more respectable than she seems.  She has, however, the most\nextraordinary opinions--wishes to do away with the aristocracy, thinks it\nwrong that Arthur should have Kingscote when papa dies, etc.  I don't see\nwhat it signifies to her that poor Arthur should come into the property,\nwhich will be so delightful--except for papa dying.  But Harold says she\nis mad.  He chaffs her tremendously about her radicalism, and he is so\nimmensely clever that she can't answer him, though she is rather clever\ntoo.\n\nThere is also a Frenchman, a nephew, or cousin, or something, of the\nperson of the house, who is extremely nasty; and a German professor, or\ndoctor, who eats with his knife and is a great bore.  I am so very sorry\nabout giving up my visit.  I am afraid you will never ask me again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nFROM LEON VERDIER, IN PARIS, TO PROSPER GOBAIN, AT LILLE.\n\nSeptember 28th.\n\nMy Dear Prosper--It is a long time since I have given you of my news, and\nI don't know what puts it into my head to-night to recall myself to your\naffectionate memory.  I suppose it is that when we are happy the mind\nreverts instinctively to those with whom formerly we shared our\nexaltations and depressions, and _je t'eu ai trop dit, dans le bon temps,\nmon gros Prosper_, and you always listened to me too imperturbably, with\nyour pipe in your mouth, your waistcoat unbuttoned, for me not to feel\nthat I can count upon your sympathy to-day.  _Nous en sommes nous\nflanquees des confidences_--in those happy days when my first thought in\nseeing an adventure _poindre a l'horizon_ was of the pleasure I should\nhave in relating it to the great Prosper.  As I tell thee, I am happy;\ndecidedly, I am happy, and from this affirmation I fancy you can\nconstruct the rest.  Shall I help thee a little?  Take three adorable\ngirls . . . three, my good Prosper--the mystic number--neither more nor\nless.  Take them and place thy insatiable little Leon in the midst of\nthem!  Is the situation sufficiently indicated, and do you apprehend the\nmotives of my felicity?\n\nYou expected, perhaps, I was going to tell you that I had made my\nfortune, or that the Uncle Blondeau had at last decided to return into\nthe breast of nature, after having constituted me his universal legatee.\nBut I needn't remind you that women are always for something in the\nhappiness of him who writes to thee--for something in his happiness, and\nfor a good deal more in his misery.  But don't let me talk of misery now;\ntime enough when it comes; _ces demoiselles_ have gone to join the\nserried ranks of their amiable predecessors.  Excuse me--I comprehend\nyour impatience.  I will tell you of whom _ces demoiselles_ consist.\n\nYou have heard me speak of my _cousine_ de Maisonrouge, that grande\n_belle femme_, who, after having married, _en secondes_ noces--there had\nbeen, to tell the truth, some irregularity about her first union--a\nvenerable relic of the old noblesse of Poitou, was left, by the death of\nher husband, complicated by the indulgence of expensive tastes on an\nincome of 17,000 francs, on the pavement of Paris, with two little demons\nof daughters to bring up in the path of virtue.  She managed to bring\nthem up; my little cousins are rigidly virtuous.  If you ask me how she\nmanaged it, I can't tell you; it's no business of mine, and, _a fortiori_\nnone of yours.  She is now fifty years old (she confesses to\nthirty-seven), and her daughters, whom she has never been able to marry,\nare respectively twenty-seven and twenty-three (they confess to twenty\nand to seventeen).  Three years ago she had the thrice-blessed idea of\nopening a sort of _pension_ for the entertainment and instruction of the\nblundering barbarians who come to Paris in the hope of picking up a few\nstray particles of the language of Voltaire--or of Zola.  The idea _lui a\nporte bonheur_; the shop does a very good business.  Until within a few\nmonths ago it was carried on by my cousins alone; but lately the need of\na few extensions and embellishments has caused itself to be felt.  My\ncousin has undertaken them, regardless of expense; she has asked me to\ncome and stay with her--board and lodging gratis--and keep an eye on the\ngrammatical eccentricities of her _pensionnaires_.  I am the extension,\nmy good Prosper; I am the embellishment!  I live for nothing, and I\nstraighten up the accent of the prettiest English lips.  The English lips\nare not all pretty, heaven knows, but enough of them are so to make it a\ngaining bargain for me.\n\nJust now, as I told you, I am in daily conversation with three separate\npairs.  The owner of one of them has private lessons; she pays extra.  My\ncousin doesn't give me a sou of the money; but I make bold, nevertheless,\nto say that my trouble is remunerated.  But I am well, very well, with\nthe proprietors of the two other pairs.  One of them is a little\nAnglaise, of about twenty--a little _figure de keepsake_; the most\nadorable miss that you ever, or at least that I ever beheld.  She is\ndecorated all over with beads and bracelets and embroidered dandelions;\nbut her principal decoration consists of the softest little gray eyes in\nthe world, which rest upon you with a profundity of confidence--a\nconfidence that I really feel some compunction in betraying.  She has a\ntint as white as this sheet of paper, except just in the middle of each\ncheek, where it passes into the purest and most transparent, most liquid,\ncarmine.  Occasionally this rosy fluid overflows into the rest of her\nface--by which I mean that she blushes--as softly as the mark of your\nbreath on the window-pane.\n\nLike every Anglaise, she is rather pinched and prim in public; but it is\nvery easy to see that when no one is looking _elle ne demande qu'a se\nlaisser aller_!  Whenever she wants it I am always there, and I have\ngiven her to understand that she can count upon me.  I have reason to\nbelieve that she appreciates the assurance, though I am bound in honesty\nto confess that with her the situation is a little less advanced than\nwith the others.  _Que voulez-vous_?  The English are heavy, and the\nAnglaises move slowly, that's all.  The movement, however, is\nperceptible, and once this fact is established I can let the pottage\nsimmer.  I can give her time to arrive, for I am over-well occupied with\nher _concurrentes_.  _Celles-ci_ don't keep me waiting, _par exemple_!\n\nThese young ladies are Americans, and you know that it is the national\ncharacter to move fast.  \"All right--go ahead!\"  (I am learning a great\ndeal of English, or, rather, a great deal of American.)  They go ahead at\na rate that sometimes makes it difficult for me to keep up.  One of them\nis prettier than the other; but this hatter (the one that takes the\nprivate lessons) is really _une file prodigieuse_.  _Ah, par exemple,\nelle brule ses vais-seux cella-la_!  She threw herself into my arms the\nvery first day, and I almost owed her a grudge for having deprived me of\nthat pleasure of gradation, of carrying the defences, one by one, which\nis almost as great as that of entering the place.\n\nWould you believe that at the end of exactly twelve minutes she gave me a\nrendezvous?  It is true it was in the Galerie d'Apollon, at the Louvre;\nbut that was respectable for a beginning, and since then we have had them\nby the dozen; I have ceased to keep the account.  _Non, c'est une file\nqui me depasse_.\n\nThe little one (she has a mother somewhere, out of sight, shut up in a\ncloset or a trunk) is a good deal prettier, and, perhaps, on that account\n_elle y met plus de facons_.  She doesn't knock about Paris with me by\nthe hour; she contents herself with long interviews in the _petit salon_,\nwith the curtains half-drawn, beginning at about three o'clock, when\nevery one is _a la promenade_.  She is admirable, this little one; a\nlittle too thin, the bones rather accentuated, but the detail, on the\nwhole, most satisfactory.  And you can say anything to her.  She takes\nthe trouble to appear not to understand, but her conduct, half an hour\nafterwards, reassures you completely--oh, completely!\n\nHowever, it is the tall one, the one of the private lessons, that is the\nmost remarkable.  These private lessons, my good Prosper, are the most\nbrilliant invention of the age, and a real stroke of genius on the part\nof Miss Miranda!  They also take place in the _petit salon_, but with the\ndoors tightly closed, and with explicit directions to every one in the\nhouse that we are not to be disturbed.  And we are not, my good Prosper;\nwe are not!  Not a sound, not a shadow, interrupts our felicity.  My\n_cousine_ is really admirable; the shop deserves to succeed.  Miss\nMiranda is tall and rather flat; she is too pale; she hasn't the adorable\n_rougeurs_ of the little Anglaise.  But she has bright, keen, inquisitive\neyes, superb teeth, a nose modelled by a sculptor, and a way of holding\nup her head and looking every one in the face, which is the most finished\npiece of impertinence I ever beheld.  She is making the _tour du monde_\nentirely alone, without even a soubrette to carry the ensign, for the\npurpose of seeing for herself _a quoi s'en tenir sur les hommes et les\nchoses--on les hommes_ particularly.  _Dis donc_, Prosper, it must be a\n_drole de pays_ over there, where young persons animated by this ardent\ncuriosity are manufactured!  If we should turn the tables, some day, thou\nand I, and go over and see it for ourselves.  It is as well that we\nshould go and find them _chez elles_, as that they should come out here\nafter us.  _Dis donc, mon gras Prosper_ . . .\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nFROM DR. RUDOLF STAUB, IN PARIS, TO DR. JULIUS HIRSCH, AT GOTTINGEN.\n\nMy dear brother in Science--I resume my hasty notes, of which I sent you\nthe first instalment some weeks ago.  I mentioned then that I intended to\nleave my hotel, not finding it sufficiently local and national.  It was\nkept by a Pomeranian, and the waiters, without exception, were from the\nFatherland.  I fancied myself at Berlin, Unter den Linden, and I\nreflected that, having taken the serious step of visiting the\nhead-quarters of the Gallic genius, I should try and project myself; as\nmuch as possible, into the circumstances which are in part the\nconsequence and in part the cause of its irrepressible activity.  It\nseemed to me that there could be no well-grounded knowledge without this\npreliminary operation of placing myself in relations, as slightly as\npossible modified by elements proceeding from a different combination of\ncauses, with the spontaneous home-life of the country.\n\nI accordingly engaged a room in the house of a lady of pure French\nextraction and education, who supplements the shortcomings of an income\ninsufficient to the ever-growing demands of the Parisian system of sense-\ngratification, by providing food and lodging for a limited number of\ndistinguished strangers.  I should have preferred to have my room alone\nin the house, and to take my meals in a brewery, of very good appearance,\nwhich I speedily discovered in the same street; but this arrangement,\nthough very lucidly proposed by myself; was not acceptable to the\nmistress of the establishment (a woman with a mathematical head), and I\nhave consoled myself for the extra expense by fixing my thoughts upon the\nopportunity that conformity to the customs of the house gives me of\nstudying the table-manners of my companions, and of observing the French\nnature at a peculiarly physiological moment, the moment when the\nsatisfaction of the _taste_, which is the governing quality in its\ncomposition, produces a kind of exhalation, an intellectual\ntranspiration, which, though light and perhaps invisible to a superficial\nspectator, is nevertheless appreciable by a properly adjusted instrument.\n\nI have adjusted my instrument very satisfactorily (I mean the one I carry\nin my good square German head), and I am not afraid of losing a single\ndrop of this valuable fluid, as it condenses itself upon the plate of my\nobservation.  A prepared surface is what I need, and I have prepared my\nsurface.\n\nUnfortunately here, also, I find the individual native in the minority.\nThere are only four French persons in the house--the individuals\nconcerned in its management, three of whom are women, and one a man.  This\npreponderance of the feminine element is, however, in itself\ncharacteristic, as I need not remind you what an abnormally--developed\npart this sex has played in French history.  The remaining figure is\napparently that of a man, but I hesitate to classify him so\nsuperficially.  He appears to me less human than simian, and whenever I\nhear him talk I seem to myself to have paused in the street to listen to\nthe shrill clatter of a hand-organ, to which the gambols of a hairy\n_homunculus_ form an accompaniment.\n\nI mentioned to you before that my expectation of rough usage, in\nconsequence of my German nationality, had proved completely unfounded.  No\none seems to know or to care what my nationality is, and I am treated, on\nthe contrary, with the civility which is the portion of every traveller\nwho pays the bill without scanning the items too narrowly.  This, I\nconfess, has been something of a surprise to me, and I have not yet made\nup my mind as to the fundamental cause of the anomaly.  My determination\nto take up my abode in a French interior was largely dictated by the\nsupposition that I should be substantially disagreeable to its inmates.  I\nwished to observe the different forms taken by the irritation that I\nshould naturally produce; for it is under the influence of irritation\nthat the French character most completely expresses itself.  My presence,\nhowever, does not appear to operate as a stimulus, and in this respect I\nam materially disappointed.  They treat me as they treat every one else;\nwhereas, in order to be treated differently, I was resigned in advance to\nbe treated worse.  I have not, as I say, fully explained to myself this\nlogical contradiction; but this is the explanation to which I tend.  The\nFrench are so exclusively occupied with the idea of themselves, that in\nspite of the very definite image the German personality presented to them\nby the war of 1870, they have at present no distinct apprehension of its\nexistence.  They are not very sure that there are any Germans; they have\nalready forgotten the convincing proofs of the fact that were presented\nto them nine years ago.  A German was something disagreeable, which they\ndetermined to keep out of their conception of things.  I therefore think\nthat we are wrong to govern ourselves upon the hypothesis of the\n_revanche_; the French nature is too shallow for that large and powerful\nplant to bloom in it.\n\nThe English-speaking specimens, too, I have not been willing to neglect\nthe opportunity to examine; and among these I have paid special attention\nto the American varieties, of which I find here several singular\nexamples.  The two most remarkable are a young man who presents all the\ncharacteristics of a period of national decadence; reminding me strongly\nof some diminutive Hellenised Roman of the third century.  He is an\nillustration of the period of culture in which the faculty of\nappreciation has obtained such a preponderance over that of production\nthat the latter sinks into a kind of rank sterility, and the mental\ncondition becomes analogous to that of a malarious bog.  I learn from him\nthat there is an immense number of Americans exactly resembling him, and\nthat the city of Boston, indeed, is almost exclusively composed of them.\n(He communicated this fact very proudly, as if it were greatly to the\ncredit of his native country; little perceiving the truly sinister\nimpression it made upon me.)\n\nWhat strikes one in it is that it is a phenomenon to the best of my\nknowledge--and you know what my knowledge is--unprecedented and unique in\nthe history of mankind; the arrival of a nation at an ultimate stage of\nevolution without having passed through the mediate one; the passage of\nthe fruit, in other words, from crudity to rottenness, without the\ninterposition of a period of useful (and ornamental) ripeness.  With the\nAmericans, indeed, the crudity and the rottenness are identical and\nsimultaneous; it is impossible to say, as in the conversation of this\ndeplorable young man, which is one and which is the other; they are\ninextricably mingled.  I prefer the talk of the French _homunculus_; it\nis at least more amusing.\n\nIt is interesting in this manner to perceive, so largely developed, the\ngerms of extinction in the so-called powerful Anglo-Saxon family.  I find\nthem in almost as recognisable a form in a young woman from the State of\nMaine, in the province of New England, with whom I have had a good deal\nof conversation.  She differs somewhat from the young man I just\nmentioned, in that the faculty of production, of action, is, in her, less\ninanimate; she has more of the freshness and vigour that we suppose to\nbelong to a young civilisation.  But unfortunately she produces nothing\nbut evil, and her tastes and habits are similarly those of a Roman lady\nof the lower Empire.  She makes no secret of them, and has, in fact,\nelaborated a complete system of licentious behaviour.  As the\nopportunities she finds in her own country do not satisfy her, she has\ncome to Europe \"to try,\" as she says, \"for herself.\"  It is the doctrine\nof universal experience professed with a cynicism that is really most\nextraordinary, and which, presenting itself in a young woman of\nconsiderable education, appears to me to be the judgment of a society.\n\nAnother observation which pushes me to the same induction--that of the\npremature vitiation of the American population--is the attitude of the\nAmericans whom I have before me with regard to each other.  There is\nanother young lady here, who is less abnormally developed than the one I\nhave just described, but who yet bears the stamp of this peculiar\ncombination of incompleteness and effeteness.  These three persons look\nwith the greatest mistrust and aversion upon each other; and each has\nrepeatedly taken me apart and assured me, secretly, that he or she only\nis the real, the genuine, the typical American.  A type that has lost\nitself before it has been fixed--what can you look for from this?\n\nAdd to this that there are two young Englanders in the house, who hate\nall the Americans in a lump, making between them none of the distinctions\nand favourable comparisons which they insist upon, and you will, I think,\nhold me warranted in believing that, between precipitate decay and\ninternecine enmities, the English-speaking family is destined to consume\nitself; and that with its decline the prospect of general pervasiveness,\nto which I alluded above, will brighten for the deep-lunged children of\nthe Fatherland!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nMIRANDA HOPE TO HER MOTHER.\n\nOctober 22d\n\nDear Mother--I am off in a day or two to visit some new country; I\nhaven't yet decided which.  I have satisfied myself with regard to\nFrance, and obtained a good knowledge of the language.  I have enjoyed my\nvisit to Madame de Maisonrouge deeply, and feel as if I were leaving a\ncircle of real friends.  Everything has gone on beautifully up to the\nend, and every one has been as kind and attentive as if I were their own\nsister, especially Mr. Verdier, the French gentleman, from whom I have\ngained more than I ever expected (in six weeks), and with whom I have\npromised to correspond.  So you can imagine me dashing off the most\ncorrect French letters; and, if you don't believe it, I will keep the\nrough draft to show you when I go back.\n\nThe German gentleman is also more interesting, the more you know him; it\nseems sometimes as if I could fairly drink in his ideas.  I have found\nout why the young lady from New York doesn't like me!  It is because I\nsaid one day at dinner that I admired to go to the Louvre.  Well, when I\nfirst came, it seemed as if I _did_ admire everything!\n\nTell William Platt his letter has come.  I knew he would have to write,\nand I was bound I would make him!  I haven't decided what country I will\nvisit yet; it seems as if there were so many to choose from.  But I shall\ntake care to pick out a good one, and to meet plenty of fresh\nexperiences.\n\nDearest mother, my money holds out, and it _is_ most interesting!","label":"longbench","length":19020,"title":"Transcribed from the 1887 Macmillan and Co. edition by David Price, email"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nBritish nationality law\nThe primary law governing nationality in the United Kingdom is the British Nationality Act 1981, which came into force on 1 January 1983. Regulations apply to the British Islands, which include the UK itself and the Crown dependencies, and the 14 British Overseas Territories.\nThe six classes of British nationality each have varying degrees of civil and political rights, due to the UK's historical status as a colonial empire. The principal class of British nationality is British citizenship, which is associated with the British Islands. British nationals associated with an overseas territory are British Overseas Territories citizens (BOTCs). Almost all BOTCs (except for those from Akrotiri and Dhekelia) have also been British citizens since 2002. Individuals connected with former British colonies may hold residual forms of British nationality, which do not confer an automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom and generally may no longer be acquired. These residual nationalities are the statuses of British Overseas citizen, British subject, British National (Overseas), and British protected person.\nAll persons born in the British Islands before 1 January 1983 were automatically granted citizenship by birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. Individuals born in those territories since that date only receive citizenship at birth if at least the mother is a British citizen or holds settled status. Foreign nationals may naturalise as British citizens after meeting a minimum residence requirement (usually five years) and acquiring settled status.\nThe United Kingdom was previously a member state of the European Union (EU) and British citizens held full EU citizenship. They had held automatic and permanent permission to live and work in any EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country and were able to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Despite the UK's withdrawal from the union in 2020, British citizens continue to hold permanent permission to work and reside in the Republic of Ireland as part of the Common Travel Area.\n\nTerminology\nThe distinction between the meaning of the terms citizenship and nationality is not always clear in the English language and differs by country. Generally, nationality refers to a person's legal belonging to a sovereign state and is the common term used in international treaties when addressing members of a country, while citizenship usually means the set of rights and duties a person has in that nation. This distinction is clearly defined in many non-English speaking countries but not in the Anglosphere. Historically, an individual associated with Britain was neither a national nor a citizen, but a British subject. British citizenship was not created until passage of the British Nationality Act 1981. This Act defined six types of nationality with varying degrees of civil and political rights, dependent on a person's connections with the United Kingdom, overseas territories, or former colonies. British citizens hold their status because of a close connection with the British Islands, usually through their own (or parents' or grandparents') birth, adoption, naturalisation, or registration as citizens of the UK.\n\nTypes of British nationality\nThere are six types of British nationality: any person who is a British citizen, British Overseas Territories citizen (BOTC), British Overseas citizen (BOC), British National (Overseas) (BN(O)), British subject, or British protected person is a British national. Of these statuses, only British citizenship grants automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom. British Overseas Territories are areas outside of the British Islands where the UK holds sovereignty. Since 2002, nearly all BOTCs also hold British citizenship, except for those associated with Akrotiri and Dhekelia.The other four categories are residual nationality classes that generally cannot be acquired. BOCs are people connected with former British colonies who have no close ties to the UK or overseas territories. BN(O)s are Hong Kong residents who voluntarily registered for this status before the territory's transfer to China in 1997. British subjects hold their status through a connection either to former  British India or to what is now the Republic of Ireland as they existed before 1949. British protected persons come from areas controlled by the British Empire but were never formally incorporated as Crown territory; this includes protectorates, protected states, mandated territories, and Indian princely states.\n\nHistory\nDevelopment from feudal allegiance\nBefore the concept of nationality was codified in legislation, inhabitants of English communities owed allegiance to their feudal lords, who were themselves vassals of the monarch. This system of loyalty, indirectly owed to the monarch personally, developed into a general establishment of subjecthood to the Crown. Calvin's Case in 1608 established the principle of jus soli, that all those who were born within Crown dominions were natural-born subjects. After passage of the Acts of Union 1707, English and Scottish subjects became British subjects. Similarly, the Kingdom of Ireland was merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Natural-born subjects were considered to owe perpetual allegiance to the Crown and could not voluntarily renounce British subject status until this was first permitted in 1870.Prior to 1708, foreigners could only be naturalised through Acts of Parliament. Protestants fleeing religious persecution in mainland Europe were allowed to naturalise as subjects in 1708, but this was quickly repealed in 1711 in response to the number of migrants exercising that ability. A standard administrative process was not introduced until 1844, when applicants were first able to acquire naturalisation grants from the Home Office. Despite the creation of this pathway, personalised naturalising legislation continued to be enacted until 1975.The monarch could personally make any individual a subject by royal prerogative. By this method, a foreigner became a denizen \u2013 although they were no longer considered an alien, they could not pass subject status to their children by descent and were barred from Crown service and public office. This mechanism was no longer used after 1873.Until the mid-19th century, it was unclear whether nationality regulations in the United Kingdom were applicable elsewhere in the British Empire. Individual colonies had each developed their own procedures and requirements for naturalisation, granting subject status at the discretion of the local governments. In 1847, Parliament formalised a clear distinction between subjects who were naturalised in the UK and those who became British subjects in other territories. Individuals who naturalised in the UK were deemed to have received the status by imperial naturalisation, which was valid throughout the Empire. Those naturalising in colonies were said to have gone through local naturalisation and were given subject status valid only within the relevant territory; a subject who locally naturalised in Canada was a British subject there, but not in England or New Zealand. When travelling outside of the Empire, British subjects who were locally naturalised in a colony were still entitled to imperial protection.Certain territories that came under British jurisdiction were not formally incorporated as Crown territory proper. These included protectorates, protected states, mandated territories, and Indian princely states. Because domestic law treated these areas as foreign territory, birth in one of these areas did not automatically confer British subject status. Instead, most people associated with these territories were designated as British protected persons. British protected persons were treated as aliens in the United Kingdom, but both British subjects and protected persons could be issued British passports. Protected persons could not travel to the UK without first requesting permission, but were afforded the same consular protection as British subjects when travelling outside of the Empire.\n\nImperial common code\nParliament brought regulations for British subject status into codified statute law for the first time with passage of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914. British subject status was standardised as a common nationality across the Empire. Dominions that adopted Part II of this Act as part of local legislation were authorised to grant subject status to aliens by imperial naturalisation.The 1914 regulations codified the doctrine of coverture into imperial nationality law, where a woman's consent to marry a foreigner was also assumed to be intent to denaturalise; British women who married foreign men automatically lost their British nationality. There were two exceptions to this: a wife married to a husband who lost his British subject status was able to retain British nationality by declaration, and a British-born widow or divorc\u00e9e who had lost her British nationality through marriage could reacquire that status without meeting residence requirements after the dissolution or termination of her marriage.By the end of the First World War, the Dominions had exercised increasing levels of autonomy in managing their own affairs and each by then had developed a distinct national identity. Britain formally recognised this at the 1926 Imperial Conference, jointly issuing the Balfour Declaration with all the Dominion heads of government, which stated that the United Kingdom and Dominions were autonomous and equal to each other within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Full legislative independence was granted to the Dominions with passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931.Women's rights groups throughout the Empire pressured the imperial government during this time to amend nationality regulations that tied a married woman's status to that of her husband. Because the government could no longer enforce legislative supremacy over the Dominions after 1931 and wanted to maintain a strong constitutional link to them through the common nationality code, it was unwilling to make major changes without unanimous agreement among the Dominions on this issue, which it did not have. Imperial legal uniformity was nevertheless eroded during the 1930s; New Zealand and Australia amended their laws in 1935 and 1936 to allow women denaturalised by marriage to retain their rights as British subjects, and Ireland changed its regulations in 1935 to cause no change to a woman's nationality after her marriage.\n\nIrish independence\nIrish resistance to the Union and desire for local self-governance led to the Irish War of Independence. Following the war, the island of Ireland was partitioned into two parts. Southern Ireland became the Irish Free State in 1922, while Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Northern Ireland was included in the Irish Free State on independence, but had the right to opt out of the new state within one month of its establishment. This option was exercised on 7 December 1922. The 24-hour period in which Northern Ireland was officially part of the Irish Free State meant that every person ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland on 6 December who fulfilled the citizenship provisions in the Constitution of the Irish Free State had automatically become an Irish citizen on that date.At its inception, the Irish Free State gained independence as a Dominion within the British Empire. Imperial legislation at the time dictated that although individual Dominions could define a citizenship for their own citizens, that citizenship would only be effective within the local Dominion's borders. A Canadian, New Zealand, or Irish citizen who traveled outside of their own country would have been regarded as a British subject. This was reinforced by Article 3 of the 1922 Free State Constitution, which stated that Irish citizenship could be exercised \"within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State\".When Free State authorities were first preparing to issue Irish passports in 1923, the British government insisted on the inclusion of some type of wording that described the holders of these passports as \"British subjects\". The two sides could not reach agreement on this issue and when the Irish government began issuing passports in 1924, British authorities refused to accept these documents. British consular staff were instructed to confiscate any Irish passports that did not include the term \"British subject\" and replace them with British passports. This situation continued until 1930, when Irish passports were amended to describe its holders as \"one of His Majesty's subjects of the Irish Free State\". Despite these disagreements, the two governments agreed not to establish border controls between their jurisdictions and all Irish citizens and British subjects continued to have the ability to move freely within the Common Travel Area. Although Irish citizens have not been considered British subjects under Irish law since 1935, the British government continued to treat virtually all Irish citizens as British subjects, except for those who had acquired Irish citizenship by naturalisation since the Free State had not incorporated Part II of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 into its legislation.\n\nChanging relationship with the Empire and Commonwealth\nDiverging developments in Dominion legislation, as well as growing assertions of local national identity separate from that of Britain and the Empire, culminated with the creation of a substantive Canadian citizenship in 1946, breaking the system of a common imperial nationality. Combined with the approaching independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, comprehensive reform to nationality law was necessary at this point to address ideas that were incompatible with the previous system.The British Nationality Act 1948 redefined British subject as any citizen of the United Kingdom, its colonies, or other Commonwealth countries. Commonwealth citizen was first defined in this Act to have the same meaning. This alternative term was necessary to retain a number of newly independent countries in the Commonwealth that wished to become republics rather than preserve the monarch as head of state. The change in naming also indicated a shift in the base theory to this aspect of British nationality; allegiance to the Crown was no longer a requirement to possess British subject status and the common status would be maintained by voluntary agreement among the various members of the Commonwealth.British subject\/Commonwealth citizen status co-existed with the citizenships of each Commonwealth country. A person born in Australia would be both an Australian citizen and a British subject. British subjects under the previous meaning who held that status on 1 January 1949 because of a connection with the United Kingdom or a remaining colony became Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC). CUKC status was the principal form of British nationality during this period of time.There was also a category of people called British subjects without citizenship. Irish citizens who fulfilled certain requirements could file formal claims with the Home Secretary to remain British subjects under this definition. Additionally, those who did not qualify for CUKC status or citizenship in other Commonwealth countries, or were connected with a country that had not yet defined citizenship laws, would transitionally remain British subjects in this group.\n\nIrish departure from the Commonwealth\nDespite the accommodations for republics, Ireland ended its Commonwealth membership in 1948 when it formally declared itself a republic and removed the British monarch's remaining official functions in the Irish state. This was recognised by Britain after passage of the Ireland Act 1949. Although Irish citizens have no longer been defined as British subjects in British law since 1949, they continue to be treated as non-foreign in the United Kingdom and retain the same rights and privileges exercised by Commonwealth citizens; Irish citizens remain eligible to vote and stand for parliament in the UK.The British Nationality Act 1948 unintentionally excluded certain British subjects associated with Ireland from acquiring CUKC status. The wording of that law did not take into account the 24-hour period during which Northern Ireland was part of the Irish Free State in 1922. Individuals born before 1922 in the area that became the Republic of Ireland to fathers also born in that area but were domiciled in Northern Ireland on Irish independence had nevertheless automatically acquired Irish citizenship. The Ireland Act 1949 specifically addresses this by deeming any person in such circumstances who had never registered for Irish citizenship and had not permanently resided in the Republic between 10 April 1935 and 1 January 1949 as a CUKC and having never ceased to be a British subject.\n\nRestricting Commonwealth free movement\nAll British subjects under the reformed system initially continued to hold free movement rights in both the UK and Ireland. Non-white immigration into the UK was systemically discouraged, but strong economic conditions in Britain following the Second World War attracted an unprecedented wave of colonial migration. This entitlement was part of a wider initiative to preserve close relationships with certain Dominions and colonies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Southern Rhodesia) and to moderate nationalist attitudes within the Commonwealth. In response, Parliament imposed immigration controls on any subjects originating from outside the British Islands with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. This restriction was somewhat relaxed by the Immigration Act 1971 for patrials, subjects whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom, which gave effective preferential treatment to white Commonwealth citizens. Ireland mirrored this restriction and limited free movement only to people born on the islands of Great Britain or Ireland. However, individuals born in the UK since 1983 are only British citizens if at least one parent is already a British citizen. The Irish regulation created a legal anomaly where persons born in Britain without British citizenship nevertheless held an unrestricted right to settle in Ireland; this inconsistency was removed in 1999.In other parts of the Commonwealth, British subjects already did not have an automatic right to settle. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa had immigration restrictions in place for British subjects from outside their jurisdictions targeted at non-white migrants since the late 19th century. After 1949, non-local British subjects under the new definition who were resident in these independent Commonwealth countries continued to retain certain privileges. This included eligibility to vote in elections, for preferred paths to citizenship, and for welfare benefits. British subjects were eligible to vote in New Zealand until 1975 and Australia until 1984 (though subjects on the electoral roll in that year are still eligible). In Canada, voting eligibility was revoked at the federal level in 1975, but not fully phased out in provinces until 2006. All Commonwealth citizens remain eligible to vote and stand for public office in the UK.\n\nPost-imperial redefinition of nationality classes\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, most colonies of the British Empire had become independent and remaining ties to the United Kingdom had been significantly weakened. The UK updated its nationality law to reflect the more modest boundaries of its remaining territory and possessions with the British Nationality Act 1981. CUKCs were reclassified in 1983 into different nationality groups based on their ancestry, birthplace, and immigration status: CUKCs who had right of abode in the United Kingdom became British citizens while those connected with a remaining colony became British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs). Remaining CUKCs who were no longer associated with a British territory became British Overseas citizens. The definition of \"British subject\" became limited to include only the category of people previously called British subjects without citizenship who held that status through a connection with former British India or Ireland before 1949.\n\nFormer membership in the European Union\nIn 1973, the United Kingdom joined the European Communities (EC), a set of organisations that later developed into the European Union (EU). British citizens were able to work in other EC\/EU countries under the freedom of movement for workers established by the 1957 Treaty of Rome and participated in their first European Parliament elections in 1979. With the creation of European Union citizenship by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, free movement rights were extended to all nationals of EU member states regardless of their employment status. The scope of these rights was further expanded with the establishment of the European Economic Area in 1994 to include any national of an EFTA member state except for Switzerland, which concluded a separate free movement agreement with the EU that came into force in 2002.Not all British nationals were EU citizens. Only British citizens, British Overseas Territories citizens connected with Gibraltar, and British subjects under the 1981 Act who held UK right of abode were defined as UK nationals for the purposes of EU law. Although the Crown dependencies were part of the European Union Customs Union, free movement of persons was never implemented in those territories. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020, British nationals have no longer been EU citizens. Despite this, British citizens continue to have free movement in Ireland as part of the preexisting arrangement for the Common Travel Area.While the UK was a member state of the EU, Cypriot and Maltese citizens held a particularly favoured status there. While non-EU Commonwealth citizens continued to need a residence visa to live in the UK, Cypriot and Maltese citizens were able to settle there and immediately hold full rights to political participation due to their status as both Commonwealth and EU citizens. This group of EU citizens (along with Irish citizens) domiciled in the UK were able to vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum while all other non-British EU citizens could not.\n\nAcquisition and loss of nationality\nBritish citizenship\nPrior to 1983, all Individuals born within the British Islands (the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies) received British citizenship at birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. Individuals born afterwards only receive citizenship at birth if at least one parent is a British citizen or considered to have settled status in the UK. Children born overseas are British citizens by descent if either parent is a citizen otherwise than by descent, subject to regulations. Adopted children are treated as if they were naturally born to the adopting parents at the time of adoption. Children born abroad to members of the British Armed Forces or British citizens on Crown service are treated as if they were born in the UK.Children born in the UK to a resident Irish citizen at any time are always British citizens at birth. Since 1983, the status of a child born in the UK is dependent on whether their parents held British citizenship or settled status at the time of their birth. Irish citizens residing in the UK are deemed to hold settled status upon arrival .Regulations concerning settled status for other European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Swiss citizens have changed greatly over time, affecting the status of their children born during the different regulatory periods. EU\/EEA citizens living in the UK before 2 October 2000 were automatically considered to be settled. Between that date and 29 April 2006, EU\/EEA citizens were required to apply for permanent residency. Swiss citizens became subject to the same regulations on 1 June 2002. From 30 April 2006 until 30 June 2021, EU\/EEA and Swiss citizens living in the UK for at least five years automatically received permanent resident status. Permanent resident status for these citizens expired on 1 July 2021, after which they have been required to hold settled status through the European Union Settlement Scheme or another path.Foreign nationals may naturalise as British citizens after residing in the UK for more than five years and possessing indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for at least one year. The residency requirement is reduced to three years if an applicant is married to a British citizen and they immediately become eligible for naturalisation after receiving ILR or equivalent. Applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the English, Welsh, or Scottish Gaelic languages and pass the Life in the United Kingdom test.\n\nBritish Overseas Territories citizenship\nIndividuals born in a territory automatically receive BOTC status if at least one parent is a BOTC or has belonger status. Children born in an overseas territory to British citizen parents who are not settled in a territory are British citizens at birth, but not BOTCs. Parents do not necessarily need to be connected with the same overseas territory to pass on BOTC status. Alternatively, a child born in an overseas territory may be registered as a BOTC if either parent becomes a BOTC or settles in any overseas territory subsequent to birth. A child who lives in the same territory until age 10 and is not absent for more than 90 days in each year is also entitled to registration as a BOTC. Furthermore, an adopted child automatically become a BOTC on the effective day of adoption if either parent is a BOTC or has belonger status. In all cases that an individual is a British Overseas Territories citizen at birth or adoption within the territories, that person is a BOTC otherwise than by descent.Individuals born outside of the territories are BOTCs by descent if either parent is a BOTC otherwise than by descent. Unmarried fathers cannot automatically pass on BOTC status, and it would be necessary for them to register children as BOTCs. If a parent is a BOTC by descent, additional requirements apply to register children as BOTCs. Parents in Crown service who have children abroad are exempted from these circumstances, and their children would be BOTCs otherwise than by descent, as if they had been born on their home territory.Foreigners and non-BOTC British nationals may naturalise as British Overseas Territories citizens after residing in a territory for more than five years and possessing belonger status or permanent residency for more than one year. The residency requirement is reduced to three years if an applicant is married to a BOTC. All applicants for naturalisation and registration are normally considered by the governor of the relevant territory, but the Home Secretary retains discretionary authority to grant BOTC status. Since 2004, BOTC applicants aged 18 or older are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Sovereign and loyalty pledge to the relevant territory during their citizenship ceremonies.All British Overseas Territories citizens other than those solely connected with Akrotiri and Dhekelia became British citizens on 21 May 2002, and children born on qualified overseas territories to dual BOTC-British citizens since that date are both BOTCs and British citizens otherwise than by descent. Prior to 2002, only BOTCs from Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands were given unrestricted access to citizenship. BOTCs naturalised after that date may also become British citizens by registration at the discretion of the Home Secretary. Becoming a British citizen has no effect on BOTC status; BOTCs may also simultaneously be British citizens.\n\nOther nationality classes\nIt is generally not possible to acquire other forms of British nationality. British Overseas citizenship, British subjecthood, and British protected person status are only transferred by descent if an individual born to a parent holding one of these statuses would otherwise be stateless. British Overseas citizens retain their status by association with most former British colonies, British subjects are connected specifically with Ireland or British India before 1949, and British protected persons are associated with territories that were under British control but not formally incorporated as part of the British Empire. British National (Overseas) status was exclusively granted by voluntary registration to Hong Kong residents who had been British Dependent Territories citizens prior to the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997 and cannot be newly acquired in any case. Noncitizen British nationals may become British citizens by registration, rather than naturalisation, after residing in the United Kingdom for more than five years and possessing ILR for more than one year.\n\nRenunciation and restoration\nAny type of British nationality can be renounced by making a declaration to the Home Secretary, provided that the declarant possesses or intends to acquire another nationality. Former British citizens or BOTCs may subsequently apply for nationality restoration. Applicants who had originally renounced their British nationality in order to retain or acquire another nationality are entitled to register as British citizens or BOTCs once. Any subsequent renunciation and application for restoration, or someone applying for restoration who originally renounced their British nationality for a reason unrelated to acquiring or retaining an alternate nationality, would be subject to the discretionary approval of the Home Secretary.\n\nAutomatic loss of British nationality\nBritish subjects (other than British subjects by virtue of a connection with the Republic of Ireland) and British protected persons lose British nationality upon acquiring any other form of nationality.\n\nThese provisions do not apply to British citizens.\nBritish Overseas Territories citizens (BOTCs) who acquire another nationality do not lose their BOTC status but they may be liable to lose belonger status in their home territory under its immigration laws. Such persons are advised to contact the governor of that territory for information.\nBritish Overseas citizens (BOCs) do not lose their BOC status upon acquisition of another citizenship, but any entitlement to registration as a British citizen on the grounds of having no other nationality no longer applies after acquiring another citizenship.\n\nDeprivation of British nationality\nThe British government does not publish the number of people it strips of citizenship, but independent research by a lawyer-run website, in 2022, found at least 464 people's citizenship was revoked in the last 15 years. After the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 came into force British nationals could be deprived of their citizenship if and only if the Secretary of State was satisfied they were responsible for acts seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or an Overseas Territory.This was extended under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006: people with dual nationality who are British nationals can be deprived of their British citizenship if the Secretary of State is satisfied that \"deprivation is conducive to the public good\", or if nationality was obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of a material fact. Between 2006 and the end of 2021 at least 464 people have had their citizenship removed by the government since the law was introduced. There is a right of appeal. This provision has been in force since 16 June 2006 when the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006 (Commencement No 1) Order 2006 brought it into force. Loss of British nationality in this way applies also to dual nationals who are British by birth. The Secretary of State may not deprive a person of British nationality, unless obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of a material fact, if they are satisfied that the order would make a person stateless.This provision was again modified by the Immigration Act 2014 so as not to require that a third country would actually grant nationality to a person; British nationality can be revoked if \"the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is able, under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, to become a national of such a country or territory.\"The powers to strip citizenship were initially very rarely used. Between 2010 and 2015, 33 dual nationals had been deprived of their British citizenship. In the two years to 2013 six people were deprived of citizenship; then in 2013, 18 people were deprived, increasing to 23 in 2014. In 2017, over 40 people had been deprived as of July (at this time increased numbers of British citizens went to join \"Islamic State\" and then tried to return).The Home Office does not issue information on these cases and is resistant to answering questions, for example under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. It appears that the government usually waits until the person has left Britain, then sends a warning notice to their British home and signs a deprivation order a day or two later. Appeals are heard at the highly secretive Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), where the government can submit evidence that cannot be seen or challenged by the appellant.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said in 2018 that until then deprivation of nationality had been restricted to \"terrorists who are a threat to the country\", but that he intended to extend it to \"those who are convicted of the most grave criminal offences\". The acting director of Liberty responded \"The home secretary is taking us down a very dangerous road. ... making our criminals someone else\u2019s problem is ... the government washing its hands of its responsibilities ... Banishment belongs in the dark ages.\"A Nationality and Borders Bill was introduced to the British House of Commons in July 2021, sponsored by the Home Office under Home Secretary Priti Patel. In November 2021, an amendment to the Bill was introduced which, if passed, would allow people to be deprived of British citizenship without being given notice. At the time the Home Office reiterated its position on citizenship: \"British citizenship is a privilege, not a right\".\n\nBritish citizenship ceremonies\nFrom 1 January 2004, all new applicants for British citizenship by naturalisation or registration aged 18 or over if their application is successful must attend a citizenship ceremony and either make an affirmation or take an oath of allegiance to the monarch, and make a pledge to the UK.\nCitizenship ceremonies are normally organised by:\n\nlocal councils in England, Scotland, and Wales\nthe Northern Ireland Office\nthe governments of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey\nthe Governors of British Overseas Territories\nBritish consular offices outside the United Kingdom and territories.Persons from what is now the Republic of Ireland born before 1949 reclaiming British subject status under section 31 of the 1981 Act do not need to attend a citizenship ceremony. If such a person subsequently applies for British citizenship by registration or naturalisation, attendance at a ceremony is required.\nFor those who applied for British citizenship before 2004:\n\nthe oath of allegiance was administered privately through signing a witnessed form in front of a solicitor or other accredited person\nthose who already held British nationality (other than British protected persons) were exempt, as were those citizens of countries with the King as Head of State (such as Australia and Canada).\n\nSee also\nVisa policy of the United Kingdom\nVisa requirements for British citizens\nVisa requirements for British Nationals (Overseas)\nVisa requirements for British Overseas citizens\nVisa requirements for British Overseas Territories citizens\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nWebex\nWebex by Cisco is an American company that develops and sells web conferencing, videoconferencing  and contact center as a service applications. It was founded as WebEx in 1995 and taken over by Cisco Systems in 2007. Its headquarters are in San Jose, California.Its software products include Webex App, Webex Suite, Webex Meetings, Webex Messaging, Webex Calling, Webex Contact Center, and Webex Devices. All Webex products are part of the Cisco Systems collaboration portfolio.\n\nHistory\nWebEx was founded in 1995 by Subrah Iyar and Min Zhu. It had its initial public offering in July 2000. WebEx was listed on the NASDAQ National Market, and then the NASDAQ Global Select Market, when that was introduced in 2006.\n\nServices\nAt the time of the acquisition, all Webex applications were built on the MediaTone platform and supported by the Webex MediaTone Network (originally called the Webex interactive network), a global network intended for use with on-demand programs. The network was designed by Shaun Bryant, Webex's Chief Network Architect, and Zaid Ali Sr, Network Architect, to be one of the first SaaS platforms on the Internet.In July 2006, AOL and Webex launched a business version of AOL's instant messaging software, AIM Pro, with additional features to help workers collaborate using conferencing tools offered by Webex.On September 26, 2006, the company announced plans to offer a web collaboration \"mashup\" platform called \"Webex Connect\".On November 17, 2014, Cisco announced an evolution of Webex called Project Squared. On March 17, 2015 this effort was re-branded as Cisco Spark.On April 18, 2018, Cisco announced that Cisco Spark would be combined into the Cisco Webex platform. On this same date, Cisco rebranded all of the rest of their Spark products to Webex, including the Spark Room Kit\u2014now Webex Room Kit\u2014and Spark Board\u2014now Webex Board.\n\nOn May 15, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer reported in the month of April 2020, they had 500 million meeting attendees, and that equated to 25 billion meeting minutes, using its video-conferencing application Webex.In September 2020, Cisco launched a new platform Webex Classrooms for virtual homeroom encounters.On October 26, 2021, Cisco launched an update aimed to enhance virtual and hybrid in-person meetings and events, using AI-powered technology for their Webex portfolio.\n\nAcquisition\nThe company acquired Intranets.com in 2005, providing entrance into the small- and mid-size business market through the company's customer base of businesses with fewer than 100 employees. It acquired the ability to offer online collaboration tools such as discussion forums, document sharing and calendaring while Intranets.com provided access to the Webex communications environment for its customers.On March 15, 2007, Cisco Systems announced it would acquire WebEx for $3.2 billion. Cisco has said that its long-term plan is to absorb WebEx at both a technology and a sales level.In October 2020, Cisco acquired BabbleLabs.In February 2021, Cisco acquired imimobile, a provider of communications platform as a service (CPaaS) solutions for its Webex  collaboration portfolio imimobile.\n\nLegal proceedings and inquiries\nGoldman Sachs securities fraud investigation\nAs a result of a securities fraud investigation initiated by the SEC and by various state Attorney General offices, Goldman Sachs faced charges of issuing unfair research, including coverage of WebEx, and IPO violations for the period 1999 to 2001. Webex management allegedly dictated to Goldman Sachs analysts what the research should and should not include. Webex maintains the management's information was accurate. Another charge accuses Goldman Sachs of violating securities law in its allocation of shares in WebEx's initial public offering.\n\nRaindance lawsuit for patent infringement\nOn September 27, 2005, Webex sued Raindance Communications, Inc., a competitor, for patent infringement. On October 14, 2005, Raindance filed a countersuit against Webex for patent infringement. Both parties sought both damages and an injunction enjoining further acts they claim to be infringing on patents. On March 31, 2006, the parties agreed to the dismissal of both actions, releases of claims for past infringement, payments associated with those releases, and cross-licenses to each other's patents. The agreement resulted in Webex receiving 1 million dollars from Raindance.\n\nSee also\nCollaborative software\nComparison of web conferencing software\nComparison of remote desktop software\nZoom (software)\nPassage 3:\nCentral Library (Kansas City, Missouri)\nThe Central Library is the main library of the Kansas City Public Library system, which is located in the Library District of Downtown Kansas City, Missouri, United States. It is situated at 14 West 10th Street, at the corner of West 10th Street and Baltimore Avenue, across Baltimore Avenue from the Kansas City Club and up from the New York Life Building. It contains the administration of Kansas City's library system.Within the Central Library, the Missouri Valley Room contains a wide collection of items related to Kansas City local history, including original and published materials, news articles, postcards, photographs, maps, and directories dating from the city's earliest history.  The Library's Ramos Collection includes books, pamphlets, journal articles, and other materials relating to African-American history and culture.\nPassage 4:\nSalam\u00e1\nSalam\u00e1 is a city in Guatemala. It is the capital of the department of Baja Verapaz and it is situated at 940 m above sea level. The municipality of Salam\u00e1, for which the city of Salam\u00e1 serves as the administrative centre, covers a total surface area of 764 km\u00b2 and contains 65,275 people.\n\nEtymology\nSalam\u00e1 comes from K\u02bciche\u02bc Tz'alam Ha meaning table on water.\n\nHistory\nSalam\u00e1 was settled as a doctrine by the Order of Preachers in the 1550s, as part of the Tezulutl\u00e1n Capitulations that friar Bartolome de las Casas lobbied from the Crown. The friars had thousands of acres with hills, forest, a section of the plain and abundant water supply. Both location and weather were ideal for vines; the characteristic soil and dried grass from the rest of the plain was replaced by vines thanks to a superb irrigation system the friars built inspired by the Romans.After independence in 1821, the Central Ameran liberal criollos tried to remove the Catholic Church from power, along with the Guatemalan aristocrats of the Aycinena family. By 1829, the liberal forces of general Francisco Moraz\u00e1n expelled both the aristocrats and the regular orders from Central America, including the Order of Preachers, one of the richest. In Salam\u00e1, they had to leave behind their monastery, church and vines, which were confiscated by the Guatemalan State government, but remained abandoned due to the political turmoil of the times.\n\nBattle of Salam\u00e1 of 1839\nIn early 1838, Moraz\u00e1n's liberal forces were back in Guatemala after a peasant revolt ousted Guatemalan governor Mariano Galvez. Moraz\u00e1n and his Guatemalan ally Jos\u00e9 Francisco Barrundia invaded Guatemalan soil and when they arrived in San Sur, they summarily executed Ch\u00faa \u00c1lvarez, general Rafael Carrera's father-in-law, because Carrera was the leader of the revolt. Moraz\u00e1n's soldiers placed \u00c1lvarez' head on top of a spike as a warning to Carrera's followers. Upon learning the news, both Carrera and his wife, Petrona \u00c1lvarez \u2013 who had left Guatemala City to face Moraz\u00e1n and were in Mataquescuintla \u2013 promised to avenge Ch\u00faa even after Moraz\u00e1n's death. The liberals sent several envoys to try to meet with Carrera, but he did not want to talk to them \u2013especially not to Barrundia, who was told that he should not try to come in to talk to Carrera if he wanted to remain alive. After this, Moraz\u00e1n began a strong offensive, destroying every single town in his path, stealing the few belongings and forcing Carrera militants to hide in the mountains.Thinking that Carrera was completely defeated, Moraz\u00e1n and Barrundia went on to Guatemala City, where governor Valenzuela and the conservative criollos of the Aycinena family celebrated finally having a leader like Moraz\u00e1n, who had defeated Carrera and his peasant revolt once and for all. The Guatemalans offered to sponsor any campaign that Moraz\u00e1n wanted at that point. Moraz\u00e1n helped Los Altos and appointed Mariano Rivera Paz, who was close to the Aycinena family; however he did not return to the former aristocrats any of their confiscated possessions. In return, Juan Jos\u00e9 de Aycinena y Pi\u00f1ol, leader of the family, voted in favor of dissolving the Central American Federation, thus forcing Moraz\u00e1n to return to El Salvador to try to save what was left of his presidential powers. On his way to El Salvador, he increased repression, on anybody suspect of helping Carrera in the past.Knowing that Moraz\u00e1n was on his way to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take Salam\u00e1 with the little forces that he still had left, but was defeated and even lost his brother Laureano in the battle.  With only a handful of men he was able to escape, badly wounded, to Sanarate. After a halfway recovery, Carrera had a few more battles where he won, but suffered considerable casualties.Finally, the liberal forces captured Carrera, but could not shoot him, because the Central American Federation was in turmoil and they needed the caudillo to keep the peasants in check. Moraz\u00e1n was forced to appoint him as commander in Mita. Moraz\u00e1n would come to regret that decision, as Carrera would eventually defeat him in 1840, finishing the Honduran general run as the main political figure of Central America.As of 1850, the population was estimated to be 4,500.\n\nMiguel Enr\u00edquez and president Barillas in 1892\nIn 1892, president general Manuel Barillas called an election. It was the first time a Guatemalan president had become tired of the office and it was also the first election in Guatemala that allowed the candidates to run propaganda in the local newspapers. Among the candidates who ran for office were:\n\nLorenzo Mont\u00fafar y Rivera: a well known a respected liberal intellectual. He was the only one of all candidates who made an engraving of his portrait to publish it in the newspapers and was accused of wasting resources for doing this.\nGeneral Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyna Barrios: nephew of former president Justo Rufino Barrios and eventual winner.\nMiguel Enr\u00edquez: a Salam\u00e1 landowner. Enr\u00edquez had been a liberal, but became a conservative after the persecution that he suffered from the Barillas administration.Barillas was unique among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be. Satisfied with the response of Reyna Barrios, Barillas made sure a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicap\u00e1n Indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for the general. The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, so as not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.Only Enr\u00edquez was not compensated; on the contrary, after the elections he had to run away from his farmland in Salam\u00e1 after being accused of sedition; he was captured and executed near Zacapa.\n\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Asturias in Salam\u00e1\nIn 1904, the father of future Literature Nobel Prize awardee Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias, who was a judge, freed several students that had been detained after rioting. In consequence president Manuel Estrada Cabrera, and removed him from his post. In 1905, the family was forced to move to Salam\u00e1, where Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias lived on his grandparents' farm and came in contact with Guatemalan natives for the first time. His nanny, Lola Reyes, was a native girl who told him stories, myths and legends from her culture which eventually would impact heavily in his work. In 1908, when Asturias was nine years old, his family returned to Guatemala City.\n\nAnticommunist rebellion in 1953\nDuring the revolutionary government of colonel Jacobo \u00c1rbenz, the opposition \u2013 mainly formed by Guatemalan landlords and United Fruit Company executives \u2013 was completely against any reform that the government of Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo had established: social security, creation of commercial and public labor unions, democracy and freedom of press, among others. At the election of \u00c1rbenz in 1950, the Guatemalan elite was desperate, but most of its members hoped that the new president would back out of the policies of his predecessor, whom they accused of communism. \u00c1rbenz' image convinced them of that: the Guatemalan colonel was married to Mar\u00eda Cristina Vilanova, a lady from the Salvadorian elite. He was an Army officer, lived in a mansion in zone 10 in Guatemala City and had the proper aristocratic presence. But their hopes were shattered when \u00c1rbenz supported the formation of the Guatemalan Communist Party and then pushed for aggressive agrarian reform. Confronted with the situation, the opposition had only one clear goal: to defend the privileges that they had enjoyed in Guatemala for generations and so they embraced anticommunism to justify their fight against the government. On the other hand, the middle class enjoyed benefits that allowed them to prosper and they were loyal to \u00c1rbenz. The peasants were for the first time since the Rafael Carrera government treated with respect and dignity.This was the political and economic situation of the country when on 29 March 1953 the anticommunist opposition assaulted Salam\u00e1 at dawn: approximately 100 rebels invaded Salam\u00e1 and neighboring San Jer\u00f3nimo. The invasion was not properly organized and by 6:00 a.m. was completedly defeated by army forces that arrived from Cob\u00e1n. This event however began government prosecution of anticommunist elements, which gradually escalated until it became pure repression in May 1954, when CIA Operation PBSuccess and the Carlos Castillo Armas invasion were well in progress and the Arbenz regime was practically doomed.\n\nFestivals\nThe annual festival takes place from September 17 to September 22.\n\nClimate\nSalam\u00e1 has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw).\n\nGeography and location\nSettlements\nSalam\u00e1 has 146 settlements, being the main ones:\n\nSan Rafael Chilasco is the largest settlement and is a tourist attraction given that it has one of the tallest waterfalls in Central America.\n\nGeographic location\nSalam\u00e1 is surrounded by Baja Verapaz municipalities, except by South, where it borders Chuarrancho, a Guatemala Department municipality.\n\nSee also\nGuatemala portal\n Geography portal\nBaja Verapaz\nHistory of Guatemala\nOrder of Preachers\nList of places in Guatemala\n\nNotes and references\nPassage 5:\nZhu Yunlai\nLevin Zhu Yunlai (born 29 July 1958) is a Chinese businessman.

Zhu served as CEO of the firm between 2004 and 2014.Zhu and his father, Zhu Rongji, by family tradition, are descendants of Zhu Yuanzhang, the Hongwu Emperor, the founding emperor of the Ming dynasty, through the line of Zhu Pian, Zhu Yuanzhang's 18th son.\nPassage 6:\nCyprus Popular Bank\nCyprus Popular Bank (from 2006 to 2011 known as Marfin Popular Bank) was the second-largest banking group in Cyprus behind the Bank of Cyprus until it was 'shuttered' in March 2013 and split into two parts. The 'good' Cypriot part was merged into the Bank of Cyprus (including insured deposits under 100,000 Euro) and the 'bad' part or legacy entity holds all the overseas operations as well as uninsured deposits above 100,000 Euro, old shares and bonds. The uninsured depositors were subject to a bail-in and became the new shareholders of the legacy entity.  As at May 2017, the legacy entity is one of the largest shareholders of Bank of Cyprus with 4.8% but does not hold a board seat. All the overseas operations, of the now defunct Cyprus Popular Bank, are also held by the legacy entity, until they are sold by the Special Administrator, at first Ms Andri Antoniadou, who ran the legacy entity for two years, from March 2013 until 3 March 2015. She tendered her resignation due to disagreements, with the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank Board members, who amended the lawyers of the legacy entity, without consulting her. Veteran banker Chris Pavlou who is an expert in Treasury and risk management took over as Special Administrator of the legacy entity in April 2015 until December 2016. The legacy entity is pursuing legal action against former major shareholder Marfin Investment Group.\nIts shares were listed on the Cyprus Stock Exchange and the Athens Stock Exchange. CPB had a network of more than 295 branches in Cyprus, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, the UK and Malta. The bank had applied to open a representative office in Beijing, People's Republic of China.Trading on the island as Laiki Bank (Laiki being the Greek word for Popular), as of September 2012 it held a 16% share of the market in loans and a 14.4% share of deposits.  The Bank made a series of large loans, many to Greek companies prior to and during their financial crisis. What followed has been described as \"billions handed out in bad loans created a financial time-bomb\". After the bank collapsed, it was rescued by the Cypriot government, which took 84% ownership on 30 June 2012 and as of March 2013 it is being dismantled as part of the 2012\u20132013 Cypriot financial crisis.\n\nHistory\nIn 1901, four leading citizens of Limassol\u2014Agathoclis Francoudis, Ioannis Kyriakides, Christodoulos Sozos and Neoklis Ioannides\u2014established the Popular Savings Bank of Limassol to encourage saving among the workforce. More than two decades later, in 1924, the bank changed its name from the Popular Savings Bank of Limassol to the Popular Bank of Limassol. The bank also became the first company in Cyprus to register as a public-traded company.\nThen in 1967, the Popular Bank of Limassol changed its name to Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB) to reflect the bank\u2019s expansion beyond Limassol. Expansion beyond Limassol followed quickly, with the establishment of its first branches in Nicosia,  Famagusta (1969), and Paphos and Larnaca (1970). Also in 1970, Midland Bank acquired 22% of the company's shares, making Midland a major shareholder in CPB. The next year CPB relocated its headquarters from Limassol to Nicosia.\n\n1974 CPB established its first London branch.\n1983 CPB acquired all the Cyprus operations of Grindlays Bank located in the area under government control.\n1992 CPB opened the first branch of European Popular Bank in Athens.

Subsequently, the Marfin Investment Group through more acquisitions managed to take control of Laiki Bank, which it re-branded as Marfin Popular Bank.  In Greece, the Marfin Group consolidated Egnatia, Laiki and Marfin to form Marfin Egnatia Bank, which is the 95%-owned Greek subsidiary of Marfin Popular Bank.\n2007 The bank announced the planned takeover of 50.12% of the share capital of AS SBM Pank, a bank in Estonia.MPB also acquired 99.2% of the shares of Marine Transport Bank Ukraine for US$156 million.

At the time, the bank had a branch in Adelaide, four branches in Melbourne and five branches in Sydney.\n2011 MPB sold the majority of its shareholding in its Estonian subsidiary and returned to its historic name of Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB).\nIn 2012 CPB converted its Greek subsidiary into a branch of the parent bank.\nThe 2012\u20132013 Cypriot financial crisis resulted in financial difficulties at CPB. The Cypriot state recapitalized CPB on 30 June 2012 with the result that the government acquired 84% of the bank's equity. This increased the bank's core tier 1 capital ratio towards 9%, the level mandated by the European Banking Authority.\nIn early 2013 CPB renamed its Greek branches to CPB Bank and on 26 March the bank sold them to Piraeus Bank. Laiki was split into a good and bad bank, the good bank (Cyprus operations) merged with Bank of Cyprus and the bad bank is in the process of being sold and finally shuttered. The board and CEO were replaced on 27 March. The bad bank was being run by a Special Administrator Ms Andri Antoniadou who was acting CEO until 3 March 2015.

The church was completed in December 2013.  The city of Wenzhou is a port city believed to have China's largest Christian community.  Local Christians claim as many as 15 percent of the residents Christians with the majority being Protestant.  British missionaries George and Grace Stott had set up churches in this area towards the end of the 19th century.\nThe Sanjiang Church was completed in 2013 after almost six years and after local Christians pooled together between 3.2 and 4.9 million US dollars (20-30 million yuan) for the construction costs.  The building was large enough to hold up to 2,000 people with the church complex occupying more than 100,000 square feet of land. The church had been registered with the government authorities. The demolition was preceded by a petition by local believers of the Chinese folk faith accusing the church to disrupt the area's feng shui (cosmic harmony), highlighting the tensions between indigenous religious groups and Christianity.\n\n2014 Protests\nIn April 2014, thousands of Chinese Christians camped around a church to prevent it from being demolished after several crosses had been torn down.  In February 2014, local officials began an antireligious campaign to demolish any church buildings that violated local regulations.  Local Christians claim that Communist Party officials object to the bright, prominent crosses that some churches use to advertise their presence and want these crosses to be replaced with smaller crosses inside.  Government officials claim that the building is structurally unsound.\n\nDemolition\nAs of April 28, 2014, the entire church had been toppled over.\nPassage 9:\nBi\u0142goraj County\nBi\u0142goraj County (Polish: powiat bi\u0142gorajski) is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Lublin Voivodeship, eastern Poland.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nCharles Haughey\nCharles James Haughey (; 16 September 1925 \u2013 13 June 2006) was an Irish Fianna F\u00e1il politician who served as Taoiseach on three occasions \u2013 1979 to 1981, March to December 1982 and 1987 to 1992. Haughey led four governments while serving as Taoiseach; December 1979 to June 1981, March to December 1982, March 1987 to June 1989, and June 1989 to February 1992. He was also Minister for the Gaeltacht from 1987 to 1992, Leader of the Opposition from 1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1987, Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il from 1979 to 1992, Minister for Social Welfare and for Health from 1977 to 1979, Minister for Finance from 1966 to 1970, Minister for Agriculture from 1964 to 1966, Minister for Justice from 1961 to 1964 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice from 1959 to 1961. He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1957 to 1992.Haughey was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD in 1957 and was re-elected at every election until 1992, representing successively the Dublin North-East, Dublin Artane and Dublin North-Central constituencies.\nHaughey was the dominant Irish politician of his generation, as well as the most controversial. Upon entering government in the early 1960s, Haughey became the symbol of a new vanguard of Irish Ministers. As Taoiseach, he is credited by some economists with starting the positive transformation of the economy in the late 1980s. However, his career was also marked by several major scandals. Haughey was implicated in the Arms Crisis of 1970, which nearly destroyed his career. His political reputation revived, his tenure as Taoiseach was then damaged by the sensational GUBU Affair in 1982; his party leadership was challenged four times, each time unsuccessfully, earning Haughey the nickname \"The Great Houdini\". Revelations about his role in a phone tapping scandal forced him to resign as Taoiseach and retire from politics in 1992.\nAfter Haughey's retirement from politics, further revelations of corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and a 27-year extra-marital affair tarnished his already chequered reputation. He died of prostate cancer in 2006, aged 80.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Castlebar, County Mayo in 1925, the third of seven children, of Se\u00e1n Haughey and Sarah McWilliams, both natives of Swatragh, County Londonderry.  Haughey's father was in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence, then in the National Army of the Irish Free State. Se\u00e1n Haughey left the army in 1928 and the family moved to County Meath; he subsequently developed multiple sclerosis and the family moved again to Donnycarney, a northern suburb of Dublin, where Charles Haughey spent his youth.Haughey was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at St Joseph's secondary school in Fairview, where one of his classmates was George Colley, subsequently his cabinet colleague and rival in Fianna F\u00e1il. In his youth he was an active amateur sportsman, playing Gaelic football with the Parnells GAA Club in Donnycarney; he won a Dublin Senior Football Championship medal in 1945. Haughey studied commerce at University College Dublin (UCD), where he took a first class Honours degree in 1946. It was at UCD that Haughey became increasingly interested in politics and was elected Auditor of the Commerce & Economics Society. He also met there one of his future political rivals, Garret FitzGerald.He joined the Local Defence Force during \"The Emergency\" in 1941 and considered a permanent career in the Army. He continued to serve in the reserve FC\u00c1 force, until entering D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in 1957.On VE-day Haughey and other UCD students burnt the British Union Jack on College Green, outside Trinity College Dublin, in response to a perceived disrespect afforded the Irish tricolour among the flags hung by the college in celebration of the Allied victory which ended World War II.\nHaughey qualified as a chartered accountant and also attended King's Inns. He was subsequently called to the Irish Bar. Shortly afterwards, he set up the accountancy firm of Haughey, Boland & Company with Harry Boland, son of Fianna F\u00e1il Minister Gerald Boland.\nOn 18 September 1951, he married Maureen Lemass, the daughter of the Fianna F\u00e1il Minister and future Taoiseach Se\u00e1n Lemass, having been close to her since their days at UCD, where they first met. They had four children together: Eimear, Conor, Ciar\u00e1n and Se\u00e1n.After selling his house in Raheny in 1969, Haughey bought Abbeville and its estate of approximately 250 acres (100 ha), located at Kinsealy, north County Dublin.  This historic house, once owned by Anglo-Irish politician John Beresford, had been extensively re-designed by the architect James Gandon in the late 18th century and it became the Haughey family home, where he lived for the rest of his life. This marked the beginning of a long period when Haughey's spending was well beyond his apparent income level. For the rest of his life Haughey would refuse to say where the extra money came from.\n\nEarly political career\nHe started his political career as a local councillor, being a member of Dublin Corporation from 1953 to 1955. Haughey's first attempt at election to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann came in June 1951, when he unsuccessfully contested the general election. While living in Raheny, Haughey was first elected to the D\u00e1il as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD at the 1957 general election for the Dublin North-East constituency; it was his fourth attempt.\nHaughey was re-elected in every election until 1992, representing Dublin North-East from 1957 to 1977, Dublin Artane from 1977 to 1981, and Dublin North-Central from 1981 until his retirement in 1992 (moving constituencies in line with boundary changes).\nIn 1959, Haughey obtained his first government position, that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, serving under his constituency colleague Oscar Traynor, appointed by the first government of his father-in-law Se\u00e1n Lemass. It is unclear whether the choice was made by Lemass directly as Taoiseach, or by the cabinet against his wishes. Lemass had advised Haughey;\n\nAs Taoiseach it is my duty to offer you the post of parliamentary secretary, and as your father-in-law I am advising you not to take it.\nHaughey ignored Lemass's advice and accepted the offer. Although officially junior to Traynor, Haughey was the de facto minister, as Traynor, a minister in governments since the 1930s, was elderly and in poor health, and only nominally running the department. Haughey and Traynor clashed openly.Haughey came to epitomise the new style of politician \u2013 the \"men in the mohair suits\". He regularly socialised with other younger cabinet colleagues, such as Donogh O'Malley and Brian Lenihan.\nBy day he impressed the D\u00e1il. By night he basked in the admiration of a fashionable audience in the Russell Hotel. There, or in Dublin's more expensive restaurants, the company included artists, musicians and entertainers, professionals, builders and business people.\nHis companions, Lenihan and O'Malley, took mischievous delight in entertaining the Russell with tales of the Old Guard. O'Malley in turn entertained the company in Limerick's Brazen Head or Cruise's Hotel with accounts of the crowd in the Russell. On the wings of such tales Haughey's reputation spread.\nHaughey's status by 1961 was such that Leader of the Opposition James Dillon complimented him lavishly on the floor of the D\u00e1il, remarking on his opponent's \"skill with which he has had recourse to his brief,\" as well as his \"extraordinary erudition\" and \"his exceptional and outstanding ability.\"\n\nMinisterial office\nMinister for Justice\nWhen Traynor retired in 1961, Haughey succeeded him as Minister for Justice. As such, he initiated an extensive scale of legislative reforms. He introduced new legislation including the Adoption Act; the Succession Act, which protected the inheritance rights of wives and children; the Criminal Justice Act, which severely restricted the application of capital punishment; and the Extradition Act, which virtually prevented extradition for IRA offences. Haughey also introduced the Special Military Courts which helped to defeat the Irish Republican Army's Border Campaign.\n\nMinister for Agriculture: 1966 Farmers' Strike\nIn 1964, Lemass appointed Haughey as Minister for Agriculture. Criticism was voiced from the National Farmers Association (NFA) of the appointment of a non-rural person to the position, and there was increased antagonism from farmers towards the government. Haughey became embroiled in a series of controversies with the NFA and with another organisation, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA). Twenty-seven ICMSA picketers outside Leinster House, were arrested on 27 April 1966 under the Offences Against the State Act, an act originally intended for use against the IRA. 78 were arrested the following day, and 80 a day later as the dispute escalated. The general public was supportive of the farmers, who were not in a position to hold a strike to air their grievances, and who were clearly only posing a problem to the Minister, rather than the state. The farmers then began a national solidarity campaign, and even farmers who supported Fianna F\u00e1il turned against the government. Haughey, who did not rely on rural voters, was under intense pressure from fearful members of his own party to negotiate a deal and reduce the tension. It was Haughey's first alienation of a significant voting block, and probably damaged him electorally in later years as many farmers remembered the events, known in folk memory as the \"Farmers' Strike\".\n\nMinister for Finance and 1966 presidential election\nHaughey was appointed by Fianna F\u00e1il to run President \u00c9amon de Valera's re-election campaign for the 1966 presidential election. His interventions proved highly controversial. Fine Gael chose a comparatively young TD and barrister, Tom O'Higgins (nephew of Kevin O'Higgins), to run against de Valera. Aware that de Valera's age (84) and almost total blindness might compare unfavourably to O'Higgins, whose campaign drew comparisons with the equally youthful US President John F. Kennedy, Haughey launched what was seen as a political stroke. He insisted that it was beneath the presidency to actively campaign, meaning that de Valera would have a low profile. Therefore, in the interests of fairness the media was asked to give O'Higgins an equally low profile, ignoring his speeches and publicity campaign. The print media, both nationally and locally, ignored Haughey's suggestion. But the state-run Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann, facing criticism from Lemass' government for being too radical in other areas, agreed and largely ignored the O'Higgins campaign.\nDe Valera got a high media profile from a different source, the fiftieth anniversary commemoration of the Easter Rising, of which he was the most senior survivor. While O'Higgins's campaign was ignored by RT\u00c9, de Valera appeared in RT\u00c9 coverage of the Rising events regularly. To add further to de Valera's campaign, Haughey as Agriculture Minister arranged for milk price increases to be given to farmers on the eve of polling, as a way of reducing farmer disquiet after they had effectively become an opposition movement to the government.\nThese tactics should have ensured an easy de Valera victory. Instead O'Higgins came within less than one percent of winning the vote, with de Valera re-elected by a narrow margin of ten thousand votes out of a total of nearly one million. De Valera came to distrust Haughey; Frank Aiken, Minister for Foreign Affairs under de Valera and his lifelong political confidant, dismissed Haughey's political motives as being entirely selfish, and believed he was motivated to hold power for its own sake and not duty.\nIn 1966, the Taoiseach Se\u00e1n Lemass retired. Haughey declared his candidature to succeed Lemass in the consequent leadership election, and George Colley and Neil Blaney did likewise. As this meant that there were three strong candidates who held strong and divisive views on the future of the party, the party elders sought to find a compromise candidate. Lemass himself encouraged his Minister for Finance Jack Lynch, to contest the party leadership, and encouraged Colley, Haughey and Blaney to withdraw in favour of Lynch, arguing that they would not win a contest against him. However, Colley refused the Taoiseach's request and insisted on remaining in the race, but he was defeated by Lynch. Upon Lynch's election as Taoiseach, Haughey was appointed Minister for Finance by Lynch, in a cabinet reshuffle, which indicated that Haughey's withdrawal was a gain at the expense of Colley. The inexpensive and socially inclusive initiatives that Haughey made caught the public imagination; these included popular decisions to introduce free travel on public transport for pensioners, subsidise electricity for pensioners, the granting of special tax concessions for the disabled and tax exemptions for artists. They increased Haughey's populist appeal and his support from certain elements in the media and artistic community.\nAs Minister for Finance, Haughey on two occasions arranged foreign currency loans for the government which he then arranged to be left on deposit in foreign countries (Germany and the United States), in the local currencies, instead of immediately changing the loans to Irish pounds and depositing them in the exchequer. These actions were unconstitutional, because it effectively meant that the Minister for Finance was making a currency speculation against his own currency. When this was challenged by the Comptroller and Auditor General Eugene Francis Suttle, Haughey introduced a law to retrospectively legalise his actions. The debate was very short and the record shows no understanding of the issue by the Opposition Spokesperson for Finance, O'Higgins for Fine Gael and Tully for Labour. The legislation was passed on 26 November 1969.\n\nArms crisis\nThe late 1960s saw the old tensions boil over into an eruption of violence in Northern Ireland. Haughey was generally seen as coming from the pragmatist wing of the party, and was not believed to have strong opinions on the matter, despite having family links with Derry. Indeed, many presumed that he had a strong antipathy to physical force Irish republicanism; during his period as Minister for Justice he had followed a tough anti-IRA line, including using internment without trial against the IRA. The hawks in the cabinet were seen as Kevin Boland and Neil Blaney, both sons of founding fathers in the party with strong Old IRA pasts. Blaney was also a TD for Donegal; a staunchly Republican area which bordered Derry. They were opposed by those described as the \"doves\" of the cabinet; T\u00e1naiste Erskine Childers, George Colley and Patrick Hillery. A fund of \u00a3100,000 was set up to give to the Nationalist people in the form of aid. Haughey, as Finance Minister would have a central role in the management of this fund.\nThere was general surprise when, in an incident known as the Arms Crisis, Haughey, along with Blaney, was sacked from Lynch's cabinet amid allegations of the use of the funds to import arms for use by the IRA. The Garda Special Branch informed the Minister for Justice M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in and Taoiseach Jack Lynch that a plot to import arms existed and included government members, however Lynch took no action until the Special Branch made Leader of the Opposition Liam Cosgrave aware of the plot. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the D\u00e1il the next day if he didn't act. Lynch subsequently requested Haughey and Blaney to resign from cabinet. Both men refused, saying they did nothing illegal. Lynch then asked President de Valera to terminate their appointments as members of the government, a request that de Valera was required to grant by convention. Boland resigned in sympathy, while M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in was dismissed one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure a subservient Minister for Justice was in place when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Desmond O'Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain James Kelly, and Albert Luykx, a former Flemish National Socialist and businessman, who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms. After trial all the accused were acquitted but many refused to recognise the verdict of the courts. Although cleared of wrongdoing, it looked as if Haughey's political career was finished. Blaney and Boland eventually resigned from Fianna F\u00e1il but Haughey remained. He spent his years on the backbenches \u2013 the wilderness years \u2013 building support within the grassroots of the party; during this time, he remained loyal to the party and served the leader, but after the debacle of the \"arms crises\" neither man trusted the other.\n\nLeadership years\nOpposition to Jack Lynch\nIn 1975, Fianna F\u00e1il was in opposition and Haughey had achieved enough grassroots support to warrant a recall to Jack Lynch's opposition front bench. Haughey was appointed Spokesman on Health and Social Welfare, a fairly minor portfolio at the time, but Haughey used the same imagination and skill he displayed in other positions to formulate innovative and far reaching policies. Two years later in 1977, Fianna F\u00e1il returned to power with a massive parliamentary majority in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, having had a very populist campaign (spearhead by Colley and O'Malley) to abolish rates, vehicle tax and other extraordinary concessions, which were short-lived. Haughey returned to the cabinet, after an absence of seven years, as Minister for Health and Social Welfare.\nIn this position he continued the progressive policies he had shown earlier by, among others, beginning the first government anti-smoking campaigns and legalising contraception, previously banned. Following the finding by the Supreme Court of Ireland, in McGee v The Attorney General, that there was a constitutional right to use contraceptives, he introduced The Family Planning Bill which proved to be highly controversial. The bill allowed a pharmacist to sell contraceptives on presentation of a medical prescription. Haughey called this bill \"an Irish solution to an Irish problem\". It is often stated that the recipient of the prescription had to be married, but the legislation did not include this requirement.\nThe fallout from the giveaway concessions that had re-elected the government under Lynch, led to a succession race to succeed Lynch. As well as this a group of backbenchers began to lobby in support of Haughey. This group, known as the \"gang of five,\" consisted of Jackie Fahey, Tom McEllistrim, Se\u00e1n Doherty, Mark Killilea Jnr and Albert Reynolds. Haughey was also helped by the TD S\u00edle de Valera. The granddaughter of \u00c9amon de Valera, she was highly critical of Jack Lynch's policy regards to Northern Ireland. In a speech at the Liam Lynch commemoration at Fermoy on 9 September, de Valera made a series of thinly veiled attacks on Lynch. Although Lynch quickly tried to impose party discipline, attempting to discipline her for opposing party policy at a parliamentary party meeting held at the 28th, de Valera correctly pointed out that she had not opposed the party policy regarding Northern Ireland which called for the declaration of the British intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland. Lynch left for a trip to the United States on 7 November. On the same day the government lost two by-elections to Fine Gael in Cork and in Cork North-East. During the trip Lynch claimed in an interview with The Washington Post that a five-kilometer air corridor between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to enhance security co-operation. This was something highly unsavoury to many in Fianna F\u00e1il. When Lynch returned he was questioned on this by a Clare backbencher Bill Loughnane, along with Tom McEllistrim at a parliamentary party meeting. Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage Lynch's position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey and George Colley caucusing opinion within the party.\nIn December 1979, Lynch announced his resignation as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna F\u00e1il. The leadership contest that resulted was a two-horse race between Haughey and the T\u00e1naiste, George Colley. Colley had the support of the entire cabinet, with the exception of Michael O'Kennedy, and felt that this popularity would be reflected within the parliamentary party as a whole.\nHaughey on the other hand was distrusted by a number of his cabinet colleagues, but was much more respected by new backbenchers who were worried about the safety of their D\u00e1il seats. When the vote was taken Haughey emerged as the victor by a margin of 44 votes to 38, a very clear division within the party. In a conciliatory gesture, Colley was re-appointed as T\u00e1naiste and had a veto over whom Haughey would appoint as Ministers for Justice and for Defence. This was due to his distrust of Haughey on security issues (because of the Arms Crisis). However, he was removed from the important position of Minister for Finance.\nNonetheless, on 11 December 1979, Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach and leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, almost a decade after the Arms Crisis set back his political career. In 2010, a founder of the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising firm, said that Haughey had asked for \"a new image\" similar to the one provided for Margaret Thatcher for the 1979 general election.\n\nTaoiseach (1979\u20131981)\nWhen Haughey came to power, the country was sinking into a deep economic crisis, following the 1979 energy crisis. Haughey effectively acted as his own Minister for Finance, ignoring the views of his Minister. One of his first functions as Taoiseach was a televised address to the nation \u2013 only the third such address in the Republic's history \u2013 in which he outlined the bleak economic picture:\nI wish to talk to you this evening about the state of the nation's affairs and the picture I have to paint is not, unfortunately, a very cheerful one. The figures which are just now becoming available to us show one thing very clearly. As a community we are living away beyond our means. I don't mean that everyone in the community is living too well, clearly many are not and have barely enough to get by, but taking us all together we have been living at a rate which is simply not justified by the amount of goods and services we are producing. To make up the difference we have been borrowing enormous amounts of money, borrowing at a rate which just cannot continue. A few simple figures will make this very clear ... we will just have to reorganise government spending so that we can only undertake those things we can afford\u2026\nWhile Haughey had identified the problem with the economy, his actions made the problem worse. He increased public spending, which soon became out of control, and led to increases in borrowing and taxation at an unacceptable level. By 1981, Haughey was still reasonably popular and decided to call a general election. However, the timing of the election was thwarted twice by external events, in particular the hunger strikes of IRA volunteers for political status. The Anti H-Block Committee announced that they would field abstentionist candidates which many predicted correctly would take Republican votes away from Fianna F\u00e1il. This coincided with the Stardust Disaster, where a fire destroyed a night club in Haughey's constituency and claimed the lives of 48 young people; these caused Haughey to delay the Ard Fheis and the election. The poll was eventually held in June, much later than Haughey wanted. In the hope of winning an overall D\u00e1il majority Haughey's campaign took a populist line with regard to taxation, spending and Northern Ireland. The campaign was enhanced and hyped up by a live debate on RT\u00c9 between Haughey and the Leader of the Opposition Garret FitzGerald, of Fine Gael, over the major issues. On the day of the vote Fianna F\u00e1il won 45.5%, failing to secure a majority in the 166-seat D\u00e1il. A Fine Gael\u2013Labour Party coalition came to power, under FitzGerald and Haughey went into opposition.\nWithin days of his becoming Taoiseach, Allied Irish Banks forgave Haughey \u00a3400,000 of a \u00a31,000,000 debt. No reason was given for this. The Economist obituary on Haughey (24 June 2006) asserted that he had warned the bank \"I can be a very troublesome adversary\".\n\nOpposition (1981\u20131982)\nFitzGerald's government lasted until January 1982, when it collapsed due to a controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having a majority in the D\u00e1il, went to \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, to advise President Hillery to dissolve the D\u00e1il and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna F\u00e1il Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna F\u00e1il to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague, the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the president's aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, \"I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't put me through immediately\". Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.\nA biography of Hillery blames Haughey for the sex scandal rumours which almost destroyed the presidency of Hillery in 1979.\n\nSecond term as Taoiseach (1982)\nAfter the February 1982 election, when Haughey failed to win an overall majority again, questions were raised about his leadership. Some of Haughey's critics in the party suggested that an alternative candidate should stand as the party's nominee for Taoiseach. Desmond O'Malley emerged as the likely alternative candidate and was ready to challenge Haughey for the leadership. However, on the day of the vote O'Malley withdrew and Haughey went forward as the nominee. He engineered confidence and supply agreements with the Independent Socialist TD, Tony Gregory (in return for \u00a3100 million of investment in the Dublin North Inner City; a deal dubbed the Gregory Deal), the Independent Fianna F\u00e1il TD Neil Blaney and three Workers' Party TDs, which saw him return as Taoiseach for a second time.\nHaughey's second term was dominated by even more economic mismanagement, based on Haughey's policy of using government policy and money, in an effort to induce a sufficiently large share of the electorate to vote him his elusive 'overall majority' in the D\u00e1il. With Haughey and his supporters taking a dangerously populist line in every area of policy, and refusing to address serious shortcomings in the performance of the state, a growing minority in his own party were becoming increasingly concerned. The issue of his leadership cropped up again when in October the backbench TD, Charlie McCreevy, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Desmond O'Malley disagreed with the timing but supported the hasty motion of no confidence all the same. O'Malley resigned from the cabinet prior to the vote as he was going to vote against Haughey. A campaign now started that was extremely vicious on the side of Haughey's supporters, with threats made to the careers of those who dissented from the leadership. After a marathon 15-hour party meeting, Haughey, who insisted on a roll-call as opposed to a secret ballot, and won the open ballot by 58 votes to 22. Not long after this, Haughey's government collapsed when the Workers' Party TD's and Tony Gregory withdrew their support for the government over a Fianna F\u00e1il policy document called \"The Way Forward,\" which would lead to massive spending cuts. Fianna F\u00e1il lost the November 1982 election and FitzGerald once again returned as Taoiseach at the head of a Fine Gael-Labour coalition with a comfortable D\u00e1il majority. Haughey found himself back in opposition.\nIn August 1982, the Attorney General Patrick Connolly was the subject of controversy when a man in his house was arrested for murder. At a press conference on the affair, Haughey was paraphrased as having described the affair as \"grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented\", from which journalist and former politician Conor Cruise O'Brien coined the term GUBU.\n\nReturn to opposition (1982\u20131987)\nHaughey's leadership came under scrutiny for a third time when a report linked Haughey with the phone tapping of political journalists. In spite of huge pressure Haughey refused to resign and survived yet another vote of no-confidence in early 1983, albeit with a smaller majority. Haughey's success was partly due to the death of the Fianna F\u00e1il TD Clement Coughlan, a supporter of O'Malley. Haughey's supporters managed to have the meeting moved to the following week after the funeral, which gave him more time to manoeuver. Having failed three times to oust Haughey, most of his critics gave up and returned to normal politics.\nIn May 1984, the New Ireland Forum Report was published. Haughey was involved in the drafting of this at the time he was in office and had agreed to potential scenarios for improving the political situation of Northern Ireland. However, on publication, Haughey rejected it and said the only possible solution was a United Ireland. This statement was criticised by the other leaders who forged the New-Ireland Forum, John Hume, Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring. Desmond O'Malley supported the Forum report and criticised Haughey's ambiguous position, accusing him of stifling debate. At a Fianna F\u00e1il Parliamentary Party meeting to discuss the report, the whip was removed from O'Malley, which meant he was no longer a Fianna F\u00e1il TD. Ironically, when Haughey returned to power he embraced the Anglo-Irish Agreement that had developed from the New Ireland Forum Report.\nIn early 1985, a bill was introduced by the Fine Gael\u2013Labour government to liberalise the sale of contraceptives in the country. Fianna F\u00e1il in opposition opposed the bill. O'Malley supported it as a matter of principle rather than a political point to oppose for opposition's sake. On the day of the vote O'Malley spoke in the D\u00e1il chamber stated:\n\nBut I do not believe that the interests of this State or our Constitution and of this Republic would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this ... I stand by the Republic and accordingly, I will not oppose this Bill.\nHe abstained rather than vote with the government. Despite this Haughey moved against O'Malley and in February 1985, O'Malley was charged with \"conduct un-becoming\". At a party meeting, even though O'Malley did not have the party whip, he was expelled from the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation by 73 votes to 9 in roll-call vote. With George Colley dead, O'Malley expelled and other critics silenced, Haughey was finally in full control of Fianna F\u00e1il.\nO'Malley decided to form a new political party and 21 December 1985, Desmond O'Malley announced the formation of the Progressive Democrats. Several Fianna F\u00e1il TDs joined including Mary Harney and Bobby Molloy.\nIn November 1985, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed between Garret FitzGerald and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The agreement gave Ireland a formal say in Northern Ireland and its affairs. As was the case with the New Ireland Forum Report, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was harshly criticised by Haughey, who said that he would re-negotiate it, if re-elected. FitzGerald called a general election for February 1987. The campaign was dominated by attacks on the government over severe cuts in the budget and the general mismanagement of the economy. When the results were counted Haughey had failed once again to win an overall majority for Fianna F\u00e1il. When it came to electing a Taoiseach in the D\u00e1il Haughey's position looked particularly volatile. When it came to a vote the Independent TD Tony Gregory voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the \"lesser of two evils\" (the reason for this was Gregory's opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement as well as his personal dislike of Garret FitzGerald and Fine Gael). Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.\n\nFinal term as Taoiseach (1987\u20131992)\nHaughey now headed a minority Fianna F\u00e1il government. Fine Gael under leader Alan Dukes, made the unprecedented move, with its Tallaght strategy, of supporting the government and voting for it when it came to introducing tough economic policies. The national debt had doubled under previous administrations, so the government introduced severe budget cuts in all departments. The taxation system was transformed to encourage enterprise and employment. One of the major schemes put forward, and one which would have enormous economic benefits for the country, was the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin.\nIn late April 1989, Haughey returned from a trip to Japan, to the news that the government was about to be defeated in a D\u00e1il vote, on a private members' motion regarding provision of funds for HIV\/AIDS sufferers. The government lost the vote, which was seen as merely embarrassing, but Haughey, buoyed by opinion polls which indicated the possibility of winning an overall majority, called a general election for 15 June. Fianna F\u00e1il however ended up losing four seats and the possibility of forming another minority government looked slim. For the first time in history a nominee for Taoiseach failed to achieve a majority when a vote was taken in the D\u00e1il, on 29 June 1989. Constitutionally Haughey was obliged to resign, however he refused to, for a short period. He eventually tendered his resignation to President Hillery and remained on as Taoiseach, albeit in an acting capacity. A full 27 days after the election had taken place a coalition government was formed between Fianna F\u00e1il and the Progressive Democrats. It was the first time that Fianna F\u00e1il had entered into a coalition, abandoning one of its \"core values\" in the overwhelming need to form a government.\nHaughey in 1990 had more difficulties than successes. The first half of the year saw Haughey in a leading role as European statesman, when Ireland held the presidency of the European Community, which rotated semi-annually between the member states of the European Union. Haughey supported German Reunification and during the extraordinary Dublin Summit, which he called for in April, he pressed this viewpoint forward. He believed both Ireland and Germany were similar in that both countries were divided. During a D\u00e1il debate on German Reunification, Haughey stated \"I have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two German States for unification\".The presidential election was disappointing for Haughey with Brian Lenihan, the T\u00e1naiste, who was nominated as the party's candidate, being defeated by Mary Robinson. During the campaign the controversy over the phone calls made to the \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in in 1982, urging the then President not to dissolve the D\u00e1il resurfaced. Lenihan was accused of calling and attempting to influence the President, who as Head of State is above politics. The Progressive Democrats threatened to pull out of the coalition and support a Fine Gael no-confidence motion unless Haughey forced Lenihan out. Haughey tried to force Lenihan to resign, and sacked him when he refused to do so. Lenihan's dismissal damaged Haughey's standing in the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation.\nHaughey's grip on political power began to slip in the autumn of 1991. There was a series of resignations by chairmen of semi-state companies, followed by an open declaration by Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds, that he had every intention of standing for the party leadership if Haughey resigned. Following a heated parliamentary party meeting, Se\u00e1n Power, one of Reynolds's supporters, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his supporters were sacked from the government by Haughey, who went on to win the no-confidence motion by 55 votes to 22.\n\nHaughey's victory was short-lived, as a series of political errors would lead to his demise as Taoiseach. Controversy erupted over the attempted appointment of Jim McDaid as Minister for Defence, which saw him withdraw his nomination under pressure from O'Malley. Worse was to follow when Se\u00e1n Doherty, who as Minister for Justice had taken the blame for the phone-tapping scandal of the early 1980s, went on RT\u00c9 television, and after ten years of insisting that Haughey knew nothing of the tapping, claimed that Haughey had known and authorised it. Haughey denied this, but the Progressive Democrats members of the government stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach. Haughey told Desmond O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, that he intended to stand down shortly, but wanted to choose his own time of departure. O'Malley agreed to this and the government continued.\nOn 30 January 1992, Haughey resigned as leader of Fianna F\u00e1il at a parliamentary party meeting. He remained as Taoiseach until 11 February 1992, when he was succeeded by the former Finance Minister, Albert Reynolds. During his final address to the D\u00e1il he quoted Othello, saying \"I have done the state some service, they know it, no more of that\". Haughey then returned to the backbenches before retiring from politics at the 1992 general election. His son, Se\u00e1n Haughey, was elected at the election that followed, in his father's old constituency. Se\u00e1n Haughey was appointed as a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science in December 2006.\n\nRetirement, tribunals and scandal\nFinancial scandals\nHaughey's personal wealth and extravagant lifestyle (he owned racehorses, a large motor sailing yacht Celtic Mist, an Inishvickillane island and a Gandon-designed mansion) had long been a point of speculation. He refused throughout his career to answer any questions about how he financed this lifestyle on a government salary. Despite his professed desire to fade from public attention, these questions followed him into retirement, eventually exploding into a series of political, financial and personal scandals that tarnished his image and reputation.\nIn 1997, a government-appointed tribunal, led by Judge Brian McCracken, first revealed that Haughey had received substantial monetary gifts from businessmen and that he had held secret offshore bank accounts in the Ansbacher Bank in the Cayman Islands. Haughey faced criminal charges for obstructing the work of the McCracken tribunal. His trial on these charges was postponed indefinitely after the judge in the case found that he would not be able to get a fair trial following prejudicial comments by the then PD leader and T\u00e1naiste Mary Harney.Also in 1997, the public were shocked by allegations that Haughey had embezzled money destined for the Fianna F\u00e1il party, taxpayers' money taken from government funds earmarked for the operation of a political party, and that he had spent large portions of these funds on Charvet shirts and expensive dinners in a top Dublin restaurant, while preaching belt-tightening and implementing budget cuts as a national policy.The subsequent Moriarty Tribunal delved further into Haughey's financial dealings. In his main report on Charles Haughey released on 19 December 2006, Mr Justice Moriarty made the following findings:\n\nHaughey was paid more than IR\u00a38 million between 1979 and 1986 from various benefactors and businessmen, including \u00a31.3 million from the Dunnes Stores supermarket tycoon Ben Dunne. The tribunal described these payments as \"unethical\".\nIn May 1989 one of Haughey's lifelong friends, former government minister Brian Lenihan, underwent a liver transplant which was partly paid for through fundraising by Haughey. The Moriarty tribunal found that of the \u00a3270,000 collected in donations for Brian Lenihan, no more than \u00a370,000 ended up being spent on Lenihan's medical care. The tribunal identified one specific donation of \u00a320,000 for Lenihan that was surreptitiously appropriated by Haughey, who took steps to conceal this transaction.\nThe tribunal found evidence of favours performed in return for money (bribes): Saudi businessman Mahmoud Fustok paid Haughey \u00a350,000 to support applications for Irish citizenship.\nIn other evidence of favours performed, the tribunal reported that Haughey arranged meetings between Ben Dunne and civil servant Seamus Pairceir of the Revenue Commissioners. These discussions resulted in an outstanding capital gains tax bill for Dunne being reduced by \u00a322.8 million. Moriarty found that this was \"not coincidental\", and that it was a substantial benefit conferred on Dunne by Haughey's actions.\nAllied Irish Banks settled a million-pound overdraft with Haughey soon after he became Taoiseach in 1979; the tribunal found that the lenience shown by the bank in this case amounted to an indirect payment by the bank to Haughey.The tribunal rejected Haughey's claims of ignorance of his own financial affairs and Haughey was accused by the tribunal of \"devaluing democracy\".Haughey eventually agreed a settlement with the revenue and paid a total of \u20ac6.5 million in back taxes and penalties to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to these donations. In August 2003 Haughey was forced to sell his large estate, Abbeville, in Kinsealy in north County Dublin for \u20ac45 million to settle legal fees he had incurred during the tribunals. He continued to live at Abbeville and own the island of Inishvickillane off the coast of County Kerry until his death.\n\nTerry Keane affair\nIn May 1999, Terry Keane, gossip columnist and once wife of former Chief Justice of Ireland Ronan Keane, revealed on The Late Late Show that she and Haughey had conducted a 27-year extramarital affair. In a move that she subsequently said she deeply regretted, Keane confirmed that the man she had been referring to for years in her newspaper column as \"sweetie\" was indeed Haughey. The revelation on the television programme shocked at least some of the audience, including Haughey's son Se\u00e1n who was watching the show. Haughey's wife Maureen was also said to have been deeply hurt by the circumstances of the revelation.\n\nDeath and funeral\nHaughey's attendance before the tribunals had repeatedly been disrupted by illness. He died from prostate cancer, from which he had suffered for a decade, on 13 June 2006, at his home in Kinsealy, County Dublin, aged 80.Haughey received a state funeral on 16 June 2006. He was buried in St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton in County Dublin, following mass at Donnycarney. The then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern delivered the graveside oration.The funeral rites were screened live on RT\u00c9 One and watched by a quarter of a million people. It was attended by President Mary McAleese, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, members of the Oireachtas, many from the world of politics, industry and business. The chief celebrant was Haughey's brother, Father Eoghan Haughey.\n\nLegacy\nFormer Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald said that Haughey had the potential to be one of the best Taoisigh that the country ever had, had his preoccupation with wealth and power not clouded his judgement: Charles Haughey spent much energy fending off leadership challenges, chasing an elusive D\u00e1il majority and dealing with GUBU-like events.\"\nHe comes with a flawed pedigree. ... His motives can ultimately only be judged by God, but we cannot ignore the fact that he differs from his predecessors in that these motives have been widely impugned, most notably by those in his own party who have observed him over many years.\nTaoiseach Bertie Ahern said,\nHe had an immense ability to get things done and he inspired great loyalty amongst many of his followers both inside and outside Fianna F\u00e1il.\nIn recent times, these achievements have become clouded by the revelations that are the subject of inquiry by the Moriarty Tribunal.\n\nHistory will have to weigh up both the credit and the debit side more dispassionately than may be possible today, but I have no doubt its ultimate judgement on Mr Haughey will be a positive one.\nHistorian Diarmaid Ferriter said, He was a very promising minister in the '60s, but once he became leader all he was concerned with was staying leader. It was always about the cult of leadership. His sense of himself was much more important than any vision he had for the country. People say he discovered fiscal rectitude in '87, and people talk about his contribution to Anglo-Irish affairs, but really if you try and look for any consistency in his affairs after the late '70s you can't find it because it's just about him.\nHistorian John A. Murphy said, His vision was one of personal vanity. I don't think history's assessment will be the one Bertie uttered over his grave.\nHaughey was characterised in a 2012 novel Ratlines, by Stuart Neville. A three-part television drama Charlie, covering Haughey between 1979 and 1992, d\u00e9buted on RT\u00c9 in January 2015, with Aidan Gillen in the title role .\n\nGovernments\nThe following governments were led by Haughey:\n\n16th Government of Ireland (December 1979 \u2013 June 1981)\n18th Government of Ireland (March 1982 \u2013 December 1982)\n20th Government of Ireland (March 1987 \u2013 July 1989)\n21st Government of Ireland (July 1989 \u2013 February 1992)\n\nSee also\nFamilies in the Oireachtas\nHaughey\nHaughey (TV series)\nPassage 2:\nMembers of the 25th D\u00e1il\nThe 25th D\u00e1il was elected at the 1987 general election on 17 February 1987 and met on 10 March 1987.

J. Mara\nPatrick James Mara (1 February 1942 \u2013 15 January 2016) was an Irish public affairs consultant and politician who served as Senator from July 1981 to October 1981 and May 1982 to December 1982. He was most renowned for being the political adviser to former Taoiseach Charles Haughey. He also served as Press Secretary to Fianna F\u00e1il from 1983 to 1987 and Government Press Secretary from 1987 to 1992.He was appointed the Fianna F\u00e1il Director of Elections for the 1997, 2002, and 2007 general elections. He was a member of the board of Digicel, the company founded by Denis O'Brien to build mobile networks in the Caribbean.\nHe was regularly lampooned on the satirical Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann (RT\u00c9) radio sketch show Scrap Saturday, which ran from 1989 to 1991.\n\nEarly life\nMara was born in Galway, but was raised in Millmount Avenue in Drumcondra, Dublin. He was educated at O'Connell's Richmond Street, and at Col\u00e1iste Mhuire, an Irish-language Christian Brothers secondary school (Gaelscoil) on Parnell Square. Mara's father, a Garda, died when Mara was still in school. He was raised by his mother and sister. After school, Mara worked at Boland's Mill for a short time. After a few more jobs, he started working in the textiles industry.\n\nEarlier career\nMara started becoming actively involved in politics in his late 20s, having come from a family background of support for Fianna F\u00e1il. He unsuccessfully ran for public office multiple times.\nMara began to show interest in the career of Charles Haughey in 1970, during the Arms Trial, and began a professional relationship with him, eventually becoming his right hand man and confidante. Haughey and Mara at the time would travel around Ireland visiting local branches of Fianna F\u00e1il. Mara assisted Haughey with strategy during election campaigns. His attempts at a non-political entrepreneurial career were sidelined by his political aspirations, including his carpet sales business, which failed.\nWhen Haughey came back from the political wilderness in the late 1970s, Mara helped to secure support for him in the 1979 leadership election of the party. In his first government, Haughey appointed Mara as a senator.\nIn 1982, despite having no previous experience in public relations, Mara was appointed press secretary for Fianna F\u00e1il by Haughey. He made innovations in how to operate public relations for the party, including holding opposition press briefings. He also tried to increase the electability of Haughey, particularly among young people. \nMara adopted techniques of electioneering from US politics for the campaign for the 1987 Irish general election. He devised a strategy for the election by consulting with a broad range of people, to aid re-election. When the party went back into government in 1987 with Haughey as Taoiseach, Mara served as the press secretary for the new government, and until the resignation of Haughey. He did not work with Albert Reynolds in government.\n\nFlood Tribunal\nMara was one of the components of the so-called Century Radio module at the Flood Tribunal. Mara told the Tribunal that during the course of his employment as a Press Secretary, his financial remuneration was not sufficient to meet his immediate financial requirements, and he experienced financial difficulties. He said he received assistance from his friends, Oliver Barry and financier Dermot Desmond, in the form of loans. However, there was no interest charge, nor was there any fixed schedule for repayment. Those making the loans did not intend that the sums advanced would be treated as gifts by Mara, but were content to receive their money back, once Mara was in a position so to do. Desmond told the Tribunal that he had lent \u00a346,000 to Mara between 1986 and 1989. Barry said he remembered lending Mara a sum of \u00a32,000 on one occasion between 1982 and 1984.In the Second Interim Report of the Flood Tribunal, Judge Feargus Flood found that Mara failed to co-operate with the Tribunal by: \"Failing to provide the Tribunal with details of an account in the name of Pullman Limited, operated by him at Royal Bank of Scotland in the Isle of Man, when swearing his Affidavit of Discovery made pursuant to an Order of the Tribunal requiring him to discover, inter alia, any such account.\"\n\nLater career\nMara was the director of elections for Fianna F\u00e1il when Bertie Ahern was leader, which included managing the campaigns for the party in the general elections in 1997, 2002, and 2007.\nStarting in the 1990s, Mara began working as a public relations consultant for many prominent Irish businessmen. He worked closely with Denis O'Brien in the later stages of his life.\n\nPersonal life\nMara married Breda Brogan from Kinvara, County Galway, who was a model and later an entrepreneur, setting up a clothing wholesales company which was later bought out by Penney's. They had one son, John. Breda died in 2003. With his partner Sheila, Mara had a daughter, Elena, born in 2013. Mara pursued unsuccessful business ventures, which included selling carpets.  While Mara was wealthy in his earlier career before politics, and during it, at one point after he could not even get the credit to buy a used car.\n\nDeath\nMara died at the Beacon Hospital after a long illness on 15 January 2016 at the age of 73. He died without a will, leaving an estate of \u20ac1,593,213. He was buried in Kinvara, County Galway.\nPassage 6:\nMembers of the 28th D\u00e1il\nThe 28th D\u00e1il was elected at the 1997 general election on 6 June 1997 and met on 26 June 1997.

At the ensuing Arms Trial, charges against Blaney were dropped, and Haughey, along with co-defendants Captain James Kelly, John Kelly and Belgian businessman Albert Luykx, were found not guilty of conspiracy. Blaney claimed that the then government knew about the plan, while Haughey denied this.\n\nBackground\nThe events occurred during the Fianna F\u00e1il government of Jack Lynch. Amid the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, which would lead to the Troubles, nationalist families were being forced from their homes, and refugees \"streamed over the border\" into the Republic. The Dublin government established a cabinet subcommittee to organise emergency assistance and relief.  Haughey, then Minister for Finance and the hardline Blaney, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who was from the Donegal North-East constituency bordering Northern Ireland were members of the subcommittee, along with P\u00e1draig Faulkner and Joseph Brennan. Jack Lynch took little interest in the work of the subcommittee, and after an initial meeting, Faulkner and Brennan seem to have left their senior colleagues Haughey and Blaney to their own devices. A government fund of \u00a3100,000 was set up to provide relief to civilians forced out of their homes by the Troubles, and Haughey was given sole authority over this money.Haughey and Blaney disapproved of the cautious policies of Taoiseach Lynch on Northern Ireland and favoured a more robust approach. In August 1969, after Blaney had proposed military intervention in Northern Ireland, Lynch had asked Irish Army Intelligence to draft proposals for limited military intervention in Northern Ireland to protect nationalist areas from Ulster loyalist mobs, known as Exercise Armageddon, but it was seen to be unworkable and was not adopted by the cabinet. The nationalist areas were given a form of protection later in August by British forces in Operation Banner, and Lynch saw this as an effective short-term measure. On 30 October 1968, Lynch had met with Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in London and had called on Britain to take steps to end the partition of Ireland.\nBlaney, the then Minister of Agriculture, was an outspoken critic of government policy on Northern Ireland. In a speech in 1969 he said \"the Fianna Fail party has never taken a decision to rule out the use of force if the situation in the Six Counties so demand\". Haughey had not publicly opposed Lynch's policy, but was concerned about being outflanked by his Fianna Fail leadership rival.\nIn October 1969, a meeting of the Northern Citizen Defence Committees, which had been set up to defend nationalist areas from unionist attack, and which included IRA officers, was held in Bailieborough, County Cavan, with Irish Army intelligence officer Captain James Kelly in attendance. Captain Kelly promised the Northern Citizen Defence Committees  \u00a350,000, that would be made available to buy weapons for defense of nationalist areas against loyalist attack.\nAfter the Bailiebourough meeting, Kelly reported directly to Blaney, who in turn brought him to Haugheys's house to give account of the meeting. Kelly suggested that the government should support the IRA, acknowledging \"this would mean accepting the possibility of armed action of some sort as the ultimate solution\".Blaney allegedly made plans with Captain Kelly to import weapons from continental Europe. Haughey provided the money for the purchase from his civilian relief fund, and also made a failed attempt to arrange customs clearance for the shipment.Haughey met with the IRA Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding. Garda Special Branch informed the Minister for Justice M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in of this meeting and he reported it to the Cabinet, but Haughey dismissed it as a chance encounter. In November 1969, a Belfast republican leader named John Kelly, and Haughey's brother Jock, traveled to London to purchase arms, but Kelly became suspicious that their plot had been discovered and they returned to Ireland.\n\nRevelation and trial\nBy late April 1970, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Special Branch were aware of the plot and had informed Lynch. However, Lynch took no action until the leader of the opposition, Liam Cosgrave was also informed by the Special Branch of the smuggling scheme and pressed the Taoiseach to take action. Haughey and Blaney were sacked by Lynch on 6 May when they refused to resign.  Kevin Boland, the Minister for Social Welfare resigned from the government in protest at the sackings as he was adamant (as were the accused) that Jack Lynch and most of the Cabinet\u2014in particular Jim Gibbons, then Minister for Defence\u2014knew about the plan to import arms. The Minister for Justice, M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in who was in hospital at the time was asked to resign on 4 May. He later claimed that he had in fact informed Lynch of the individuals involved.\nOn 28 May 1970, Haughey and Blaney went on trial in Dublin, together with an Irish Army intelligence officer, Captain James Kelly, John Kelly and Belgian businessman Albert Luykx, who had allegedly agreed to use his contacts to acquire the weapons. All charges against Blaney were dropped in the District Court on 2 July 1970 and as a result he was not tried, before the main trial got underway under Justice Aindrias \u00d3 Caoimh. The trial collapsed a week later as \u00d3 Caoimh withdrew after allegations of bias. Following a second trial, presided over by Justice Seamus Henchy, the other four defendants were cleared on 23 October.At the trial there was a direct contradiction of evidence regarding the sanctioning of the imports between Haughey and the chief prosecutorial witness, Jim Gibbons, Minister for Defence at the time of the attempted imports. Haughey admitted arranging customs clearance for the shipment, but claimed in his defence that he did not know it consisted of weapons. This directly contradicted the evidence of Gibbons and Peter Berry that Haughey was fully aware of all the details of the conspiracy. It also contradicted the testimony of his co-defendants, who admitted that they had tried to import weapons, but maintained that the shipment had been legally authorised by the government. During the trial the judge remarked that either Haughey or Gibbons had to be committing perjury.\n\nImpact\nThe resignations and sackings left four vacancies in cabinet.  As a result, there was a major cabinet reshuffle and some senior politicians of the future, such as Desmond O'Malley and Gerry Collins, got their first step on the ministerial ladder.\nThe scandal led to bitter divisions in Fianna F\u00e1il between supporters of the sacked ministers Haughey and Blaney and supporters of Lynch.  The same divisions affected government policy on Northern Ireland.  Although the events led to Haughey being demoted to the back-benches, he remained a member of Fianna F\u00e1il, while Boland was expelled in 1970 and Blaney in 1971.  Blaney went on to found his own party, Independent Fianna F\u00e1il, which re-joined Fianna F\u00e1il in 2006, eleven years after Blaney's death.  Haughey later returned to ministerial office and succeeded Lynch as party leader in 1979. There was no rapprochement in the relationship between Gibbons and Haughey and when Haughey became Taoiseach, Gibbons was dropped from his ministerial office.  During a later leadership contest, Gibbons was assaulted in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann by Haughey supporters in retaliation for his testimony at the Arms Trial.The events came to be one of the defining periods of Lynch's term as leader, during which there were several crises.  Lynch supporters saw him as exhibiting strength in facing down the rebel ministers and his detractors saw it as an illustration of his weakness on the national question and procrastination in the face of difficult decisions.\nAs state papers relating to the period were released after 1995, further light was shed on the events, questioning the outcome.  Much remains unknown about the truthfulness of the various personalities involved, and what exactly each knew, and when they came to know it. The diaries of Peter Berry, Secretary of the Department of Justice, published in Magill magazine, claimed that Lynch had not been forthright publicly. Documents released through the Freedom of Information Act 30 years later showed that the state had altered statements by Colonel Hefferon to suppress the fact that he and Captain Kelly had kept Gibbons informed. This caused the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to publicly state that Captain Kelly had done nothing wrong.\n\nSee also\nExercise Armageddon\nPassage 8:\nMembers of the 27th D\u00e1il\nThe 27th D\u00e1il was elected at the 1992 general election on 25 November 1992 and met on 14 December 1992.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nHughesville, Maryland\nHughesville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Charles County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,197 at the 2010 census. Truman's Place was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 11.2 square miles (29.1 km2), of which 11.2 square miles (28.9 km2) is land and 0.08 square miles (0.2 km2), or 0.69%, is water.Hughesville was a tobacco market town.  The former tobacco warehouses are now used for second-hand thrift stores and boutique gift and craft shops.Because Hughesville, though small, is considered the strategic geographic center of the tri-county Southern Maryland region, it houses institutions such as the headquarters for the Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, an animal shelter, an economic development council, a board of realtors, and a homeless women's shelter, which serve the tri-county area. There is also a Girl Scout camp. The town has no traditional grid-layout streets, but consists of merely businesses along the highway and some very small outlying housing developments. It was announced in 2013 that the College of Southern Maryland is building their fourth campus in the town.A 5.5-MW solar farm near Hughesville generates enough power for 600 homes, and offsets the pollution of 1,600 cars.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,537 people, 503 households, and 407 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 137.4 inhabitants per square mile (53.1\/km2). There were 529 housing units at an average density of 47.3 per square mile (18.3\/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 82.04% White, 13.08% African American, 0.72% Native American, 2.73% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 0.13% from other races, and 1.24% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.65% of the population.\nThere were 503 households, out of which 36.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.2% were married couples living together, 7.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.9% were non-families. 12.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.97 and the average family size was 3.25.\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out, with 26.3% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.4 males.\nThe median income for a household in the CDP was $90,697, and the median income for a family was $103,393. Males had a median income of $49,500 versus $36,563 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $29,884. About 4.8% of families and 7.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.9% of those under age 18 and 5.1% of those age 65 or over.\nPassage 2:\nMinsk Region\nMinsk Region, also known as Minsk Oblast or Minsk Voblasts (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0301\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0446\u044c, romanized: Minskaja voblas\u0107, IPA: [\u02c8m\u02b2inskaja \u02c8vob\u026bas\u02b2ts\u02b2]; Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0301\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c, romanized: Minskaya oblast), is one of the regions of Belarus. Its administrative center is Minsk, although it is a separate administrative territorial entity of Belarus. As of 2011, the region's population is 1,411,500.\n\nGeography\nMinsk Region covers a total of 39,900 km2, about 19.44% of the national total area. Lake Narach, the largest lake in the country, is located in the northern part of the region. There are four other large lakes in this region: Svir (8th largest), Myadel (11th largest), Syalyava (14th largest) and Myastro (15th largest). It is the only region of Belarus whose border is not part of the international border of Belarus.\n\nHistory\nBeginning the 10th century, the territory of the current Minsk Region was part of Kievan Rus', the Principality of Polotsk, and later it was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the unification of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the territory became part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn 1793, as a result of the second partition of Polish territory, the area was annexed by Russia as the Minsk Region. During the collapse of the Russian Empire due to the Civil War, the western part was annexed to Poland in 1921, while the east became Soviet Belarus.\nThe Minsk region was established on 15 January 1938, based on the amendment of the Constitutional Law of the USSR. As of 20 February 1938, the area included 20 districts.  Following the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939, the former Eastern lands of the Second Polish Republic were annexed in accordance with the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact partitioning Poland and added to the Minsk Region.\nOn 20 September 1944, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck were removed from the Minsk region and transferred to the newly formed Bobruisk Region.\nOn 8 January 1954, by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Nesvizhski and Stolbtsovsky districts from the abolished Baranovichi Region, as well as the Glusk, Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck from the abolished Bobruisk Region, were added to the Minsk Region.\nIn 1960, following the abolition of Molodechno Region, its southern part became the northern part of the Minsk Region.\n\nTourism\nThe number of travel agencies in Minsk Region grew from twelve in 2000 to seventy in 2010. The most popular tourist destinations of the region are Zaslavskoye Lake, the Zhdanovichi area which has health resorts, Nesvizh Palace and its surroundings, as well as the alpine ski resorts of Logoysk and Silichi.\n\nAdministrative subdivisions\nThe Minsk Region comprises 22 districts (raions), 307 selsovets, 22 cities, 8 city municipalities, and 20 urban-type settlements.\n\nDistricts of Minsk Region\nCities and towns\nPopulation of cities and towns in Minsk Region\n\nDemographics\nSee also\nAdministrative divisions of Belarus\nVillages in Minsk Region\nPassage 3:\nHylestad\nHylestad is a former municipality in the old Aust-Agder county in Norway. The 570-square-kilometre (220 sq mi) former municipality existed from 1915 until its dissolution in 1962. It was located in the southern part of the present-day municipality of Valle in the traditional region of Setesdal in Agder county. The administrative centre was the village of Rysstad where the Hylestad Church was located.\n\nHistory\nThe parish of Hylestad was established as a municipality on 1 July 1915 when the municipality of Valle was divided into two municipalities: Hylestad (population: 658) in the south and Valle (population: 1,051) in the north. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, Hylestad was reincorporated into Valle. Prior to the merger Hylestad had a population of 662.\n\nName\nThe municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old Hylestad farm (Old Norse: Hyljasta\u00f0ir), since the first Hylestad Church was built there. The first element comes from hylja meaning a \"pool\" (possibly referring to the pool in the river) and the last element is sta\u00f0ir which means \"homestead\" or \"farm\".\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Hylestad, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality was governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elected a mayor.\n\nMunicipal council\nThe municipal council (Herredsstyre) of Hylestad was made up of 13 representatives that were elected to four year terms.  The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:\n\nNotable residents\nOsmund Faremo (1921-1999), a Norwegian politician\nAani Aanisson Rysstad (1894-1965), a Norwegian politician\n\nSee also\nList of former municipalities of Norway\nPassage 4:\nPort Blair\nPort Blair (pronunciation ) is the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a union territory of India in the Bay of Bengal. It is also the local administrative sub-division (tehsil) of the islands, the headquarters for the district of South Andaman and is the territory's only notified town.\nPort Blair serves as the entry point for visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Port Blair is connected with mainland India by both air and sea. It is a two to three-hour flight from mainland India to Port Blair's Veer Savarkar International Airport, and three to four days by sea to reach Kolkata, Chennai, or Visakhapatnam from Haddo Wharf in Port Blair. It is home to several museums and a major naval base INS Jarawa of the Indian Navy, along with sea and air bases of the Indian Coast Guard, Andaman and Nicobar Police, Andaman and Nicobar Command, the first integrated tri-command of the Indian Armed Forces and the Indian Air Force.Port Blair is also famous for the historic Cellular Jail and other small islands like Corbyn's Cove, Wandoor, Ross Island, Viper Island and so forth, which were once home to British colonists. Port Blair has been selected as one of the cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission.\n\nHistory\nPre-history\nThe indigenous inhabitants are the Andamanese. Radiocarbon dating studies of the kitchen refuse dumps from the mounds excavated by the Anthropological Survey of India at Choladari near Port Blair indicate human occupation for at least 2,000 years, although they are likely to have diverged from the inhabitants of the mainland significantly earlier.\n\nModern history\nIn 1789 the Government of Bengal established a penal colony on Chatham Island in the southeast bay of Great Andaman, named Port Blair in the honour of Archibald Blair of the East India Company. After two years, the colony moved to the northeast part of Great Andaman and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral William Cornwallis. However, there was much disease and death in the penal colony, and the government ceased operating it in May 1796.\nIn 1824 Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the First Anglo-Burmese War. In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives, alarming the British government. In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a convict establishment, but the Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced a delay in its construction.\nHowever, since the rebellion provided the British with a lot of new prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison an urgent necessity. Construction began in November 1857 at the renovated Port Blair, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp which seemed to have been the source of many of the old colony's problems. The penal colony was originally on Viper Island. The convicts, mostly political prisoners, suffered life imprisonment at hard labour under cruel and degrading conditions. Many were hanged, while others died of disease and starvation. Between 1864 and 1867 a penal establishment was also built with convict labour on the northern side of Ross Island. These structures now lie in ruins.As the Indian independence movement continued to grow in the late 19th century, the enormous Cellular Jail was constructed between 1896 and 1906 to house Indian convicts, mostly political prisoners, in solitary confinement. The Cellular Jail is also known as Kala Pani (translated as \"Black Waters\"), a name given to it due to the torture and general ill-treatment towards its Indian convicts.\nThe airport at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar's capital, has been named Veer Savarkar International Airport. The commemorative blue plaque on India House fixed by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England reads \"Vinayak Damodar Savarkar 1883\u20131966 Indian patriot and philosopher lived here.\"\nIn World War II the islands were occupied by the Japanese on 23 March 1942 without opposition from the garrison. From 1943 to 1944, Port Blair served as the headquarters of the Azad Hind government under Subhas Chandra Bose. British forces returned to the islands in October 1945.Although affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Port Blair survived sufficiently to act as a base for relief efforts in the islands.\n\nClimate\nPort Blair has a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Am), with little variation in average temperature and large amounts of precipitation throughout the year. All months except January, February and March receive substantial rainfall.\n\nTourism\nPort Blair being the capital city of Andaman and Nicobar Islands is the entry point for all tourism related activities. Tourists first have to arrive to Port Blair before progressing on to any other islands in Andaman. At Port Blair, the major tourist places to visit are the Cellular Jail, Corbyns Cove Beach, North Bay Island, Ross Island renamed to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, Chidiatapu, Wandoor and other museums that are present within city limits. Entry charges are applicable to some of the tourist places.\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2011 India census, Port Blair had a population of 100,608. Males constitute 52.92% (53,247) of the population and females 47.07% (47,361). 9.3% of the population is under the age of 6 years.\n\nLanguage\nBengali is the most spoken language of the city, followed by Telegu, Hindi and Tamil.\n\nReligion\nThe most common religion is Hinduism, followed by Christianity and Islam.\n\nLiteracy\nPort Blair has an average literacy rate of 89.76%, higher than the national average that is 74.04%. In Port Blair, male literacy is 92.79%, and female literacy is 86.34%.\n\nAdministration\nThe Port Blair Municipal Council, abbreviated as PBMC is the ruling civic body administering the city of Port Blair, the capital and the largest city in the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The council came into existence on 2 October 1957 after the assent by the President of India to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands (Municipal Board\u2019s) Regulation, 1957 Act on 11 March 1957. The council comprises a total of 24 wards after the recent delimitation and the expansion of the city limits with the merger of few other villages to the existing 18 wards previously.The recent elections for the council were held in 2022. U. Kavitha from ward 24 a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party was elected as the chairperson for the first term which commenced from 16 March 2022. On 14 March 2023, Telugu Desam Party councilor S.

It is administratively under the Sai Kung District.\n\nFeatures\nPak Tam Chung was described as consisting of six villages in 1911 with fewer than 405 inhabitants: Wong Yi Chau (\u9ec3\u5b9c\u6d32), Pak Tam (\u5317\u6f6d), Sheung Yiu (\u4e0a\u7ab0), Tsak Yue Wu (\u9bfd\u9b5a\u6e56), Wong Keng Tei (\u9ec3\u9e96\u5730) and Tsam Chuk Wan. The six villages were all inhabited by Hakka people, with the exception of two hamlets in Pak Tam.There is a visitor centre for nature education set up by the Hong Kong Government. Near the centre is a vehicle barrier leading to the restricted portion of Sai Kung East Country Park in Pak Tam Chung. For vehicles, only those with authorisation can enter the area and reach places like Hoi Ha, Pak Tam Au and High Island Reservoir.\nThere are a number of picnic and barbecue facilities within Pak Tam Chung, including a site designed for physically disabled visitors.\nPo Leung Kuk owns a holiday camp site in Pak Tam Chung, the Po Leung Kuk Pak Tam Chung Camp (\u4fdd\u826f\u5c40\u5317\u6f6d\u6d8c\u6e21\u5047\u71df).\n\nSee also\nSheung Yiu Folk Museum\nHistoric churches of Sai Kung Peninsula\nSai Kung Town\nTai Po District\nPassage 6:\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York is the United States bankruptcy court within the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The Southern District of New York is a major venue for bankruptcy, as it has jurisdiction over the corporate headquarters and major financial institutions located in Manhattan.\nOriginally, the District Court itself handled bankruptcies; these and admiralty court cases dominated nearly to the exclusion of all other cases, which were primarily handled by a Circuit Court for the District of New York and its successor Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York, until that court was abolished and its cases handled by the District Court as well.  The district became widely recognized for its expertise in handling large bankruptcies, leading companies to seek a way to file in this court.  Modern examples include the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization and the Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies.From 1980 through 2014, the Southern District Bankruptcy Court for New York handled over 18% of all large, public-company bankruptcy filings in the United States while the Delaware District Bankruptcy Court handled nearly 36%.\n\nList of judges\nThe following is a list of the bankruptcy judges, as of May 2023, for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nSee also\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York\nList of judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York\nPassage 7:\nAlamnagar\nAlamnagar (community development block) is one of the administrative divisions of Madhepura district in the Indian state of Bihar.

Khara is located 12 km from Alamnagar.\n\nGeography\nAlamnagar is located at 25\u00b032\u203256\u2033N 86\u00b054\u203240\u2033E\n\nPanchayats\nPanchayats in Alamnagar community development block are: Bispatti, Basanbara, [Khurhan, Bargaon, Singhar, Itahari, Alamnagar North, Alamnagar South, Alamnagar East, Northua Bhagipur, Kujauri, Gangapur, Kishanpur Ratwara and Khapur.\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2001 census Alamnagar Block had a population of 129,226.\nPassage 8:\nCeres Nunataks\nThe Ceres Nunataks (72\u00b03\u2032S 70\u00b025\u2032W) are a group of three nunataks located immediately east of the base of Shostakovich Peninsula in southern Alexander Island, Antarctica. They were mapped by the Directorate of Overseas Surveys from satellite imagery supplied by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey, and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Ceres, one of the asteroids lying between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter.\n\nGeology\nAccording to the British Antarctic Survey's (BAS) aeromagnetic 1975 survey of Ceres Nunataks and nearby Astraea Nunatak, this geographical feature is rich in the igneous rocks Diorite and Tonalite as presumed by the rock samples which were observed by BAS during this survey.\n\nAeromagnetic Survey of Ceres Nunataks and Astraea Nunatak\nIn December 1975, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) (originally known as the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS)) embarked on an 8-week long survey observing the proposed theory of Ceres Nunataks and Astraea Nunatak having an aeromagnetic connection between one another. I. A. Crawford and R. W. Girdler embarked on the survey, along with other accompanists and personnel members, flying at a constant barometric altitude of approximately 1130 meters (3707 feet, with an east\u2013west flightline separation of about 7.5 kilometers. Here, they proved that these geographical features were rich in geologic minerals which shared similar characteristics. Data was sampled at one-second intervals, which, at ground speed of approximately 240 kilometers per hour, equates to 15 data points for every kilometer covered. The total distance traveled on the surface was 2200 kilometers (1367 miles). The equipment used included a Geometrics G-803 proton precision magnetometer with both analogue and digital recording, a Bendix DRA-12 Doppler navigation system and Sperry C-12 gyro-magnetic compass, and a Bonzer radio altimeter.\nOverall, the 2-month long survey was a successful event and contributed to the history of Alexander Island and the Antarctic Peninsula in itself. Former contributors to this survey include:\n\nBarker, P. F. - Studied the Cenozoic subduction history of the Antarctic Peninsula region.\nBell, C. M. - Observed the geology of the southern portion of Alexander Island.\nBhattacharyya, B. K. - Examined the magnetic anomalies due to prism-shaped bodies with arbitrary polarization.\nBurn R. W. - Studied multiple fields of Alexander Island, such as the early Tertiary calc-alkaline volcanism on the island and researching the geology of the nearby LeMay Mountain Range due 40-50 kilometers north of Staccato Peaks.\nCare, B. W. - Like Burn, Care studied the vast majority of fields involving Alexander Island, such as archiving geographic reports on the Havre Mountains, Lassus Mountains and other miscellaneous peaks within the vicinity of northern Alexander Island.\nColes R. W. - Conducted two magnetic interpretation methods using rectangular prisms.\nCollinson, D. W. - Created an anisotropic susceptibility meter, along with Molyneux, L. and Stone, D. B.\nCrabtree, R. D. - Constructed a British Antarctic Territory ice thickness map\nCrawford, I. A. - Proposed an analysis of aeromagnetic data over the Staccato Peaks region of Alexander Island, Antarctica, along with Girdler, R. W.\nEdwards, C. W. - Collected early Mesozoic marine fossils from the central portion of Alexander Island.\nFabiano, E. B. - Observed grid values of total magnetic intensity, along with the help of former geophysicist Peddie, N. W.\nPankhurst, R. J. - Studied the geochronology of Graham Land, Antarctica.\nPeddie, N. W. - Former geophysicist of BAS.\nRenner R. G. B. - Former member of BAS and accepted the aeromagnetic survey to commence, chief of the 1975 survey.\nSmellie, J. L. - A complete arc-trench system recognized in Gondwana sequences of the Antarctic Peninsula region.\nStreckeisen, A. - Gave to each plutonic body its proper name.\nSuarez, M. - Credited for having charted a Plate-tectonic model for the southern portion of the Antarctic Peninsula (Palmer Land) and its relation to the southern Andes Mountain Range.\nPassage 9:\nBeryslav Raion\nBeryslav Raion (Ukrainian: \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d, romanized: Beryslavs'kyi raion) is one of the five administrative raions (a district) of Kherson Oblast in southern Ukraine. Its administrative center is located in the city of Beryslav. Its population was 55,976 as of the 2001 Ukrainian Census. Current population: 94,103 (2022 est.).The January 2020 estimate of the raion population was 45,931 (2020 est.). However, on 18 July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, the number of raions of Kherson Oblast was reduced to five, and the area of Beryslav Raion was significantly expanded. Three raions (Novovorontsovka, Velyka Oleksandrivka, and Vysokopillia Raions) were abolished and their territories were merged into an enlarged Beryslav Raion.\n\nSubdivisions\nCurrent\nAfter the reform in July 2020, the raion consisted of 11 hromadas:\nBeryslav urban hromada with the administration in the city of Beryslav, retained from Beryslav Raion;\nBorozenske rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Borozenske, transferred from Velyka Oleksandrivka Raion;\nKalynivske settlement hromada with the administration in the urban-type settlement of Kalynivske, transferred from Velyka Oleksandrivka Raion;\nKochubeivka rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Kochubeivka, transferred from Vysokopillia Raion;\nMylove rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Mylove, retained from Beryslav Raion;\nNovooleksandrivka rural hromada with the administration in the selo of Novooleksandrivka, transferred from Novovorontsovka Raion;\nNovoraisk rural hromada with the administration in the settlement of Novoraisk, retained from Beryslav Raion;\nNovovorontsovka settlement hromada with the administration in the urban-type settlement of Novovorontsovka, transferred from Novovorontsovka Raion;\nTiahynka rural hromada with the administration in the settlement of Tiahynka, retained from Beryslav Raion;\nVelyka Oleksandrivka settlement hromada with the administration in the urban-type settlement of Velyka Oleksandrivka, transferred from Velyka Oleksandrivka Raion.\nVysokopillia settlement hromada with the administration in the urban-type settlement of Vysokopillia, transferred from Vysokopillia Raion;\n\nBefore 2020\nBefore the 2020 reform, the raion consisted of four hromadas:\nBeryslav urban hromada with the administration in Beryslav;\nMylove rural hromada with the administration in Mylove;\nNovoraisk rural hromada with the administration in Novoraisk;\nTiahynka rural hromada with the administration in Tiahynka.Beryslav Raion was divided in a way that followed the general administrative scheme in Ukraine. Local government was also organized along a similar scheme nationwide. Consequently, raions were subdivided into councils, which were the prime level of administrative division in the country.\nEach of the raion's urban localities administered their own councils, often containing a few other villages within its jurisdiction. However, only a handful of rural localities were organized into councils, which also might contain a few villages within its jurisdiction.\nAccordingly, Beryslav Raion was divided into:\n1 city council\u2014made up of the city of Beryslav (administrative center)\n1 settlement council\u2014made up of the urban-type settlement of Kozatske\n29 village councilsOverall, the raion had a total of 43 populated localities, consisting of one city, one urban-type settlement, 34 villages, and seven rural settlements.\n\nGeography\nBeryslav Raion is located in the central part of Kherson Oblast on the right-bank of the Dnieper River and the Kakhovka Reservoir. Geographically, it lies in the lowland immediately before the Black Sea.\n\nHistory\nBeryslav Raion was first established on March 7, 1923 as part of a full-scale administrative reorganization of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, almost the whole of Beryslav Raion was initially occupied by Russian forces, apart from a few villages in the north of the Raion. However, by late October 2022 the majority of the rural districts had been re-taken by Ukrainian forces, although the city of Beryslav remained in Russian hands as at 29 October. The rest of the raion was retaken on 10 November 2022, when the Russian troops withdrew from the right bank of the Dnieper.\n\nSee also\nVysoke, Kherson Oblast\nPassage 10:\nKiri Territory\nKiri Territory is an administrative region of Mai-Ndombe Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The headquarters is the town of Kiri.\n\nLocation\nKiri territory has sandy clay soils, supporting food crops that include cassava, maize, banana, peanut, yams, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, rice, beans, vegetables, robusta coffee, cocoa and palm.\nMost of the land is covered with rain forest.\nThe southern boundary is defined by the Lokoro River, which flows from the southeast, entering Lake Mai-Ndombe at the westernmost point of the territory. \nKiri Territory is divided into the Beronge, Lutoy and Pendjwa sectors.\n\nEconomy\nThe Kiri General Hospital was rehabilitated in 1983, and a farmers cooperative was established in 1995.\nAs of 1997 Kiri Territory had a population of 121,604 within an area of 12,070 square kilometres (4,660 sq mi), or about 11 people per square kilometer. Trade was mostly with Kinshasa via the neighboring territory of Inongo to the west, handled by a cartel of traders who controlled prices. \nLocal products such as manioc or fish were exchanged for manufactured goods such as hammocks or machetes.As of 2004 the territory lacked electricity and drinking water supplies, and had no telephone, radio or television service.\nIt does have an airport (Basango Mboliasa Airport) in good condition that is used for occasional unscheduled flights.\nPassage 11:\nSouthern California Edison\nSouthern California Edison (or SCE Corp), the largest subsidiary of Edison International, is the primary electricity utility for much of Southern California. It provides 15 million people with electricity across a service territory of approximately 50,000 square miles. However, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), Imperial Irrigation District, and some smaller municipal utilities serve substantial portions of the southern California territory. The northern part of the state is generally served by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company of San Francisco. Other investor-owned utilities (IOUs) in California include SDG&E, PacifiCorp, Bear Valley Electric, and Liberty Utilities.\n\nSouthern California Edison (SCE) still owns all of its electrical transmission facilities and equipment, but the deregulation of California's electricity market in the late 1990s forced the company to sell many of its power plants, though some were probably sold by choice. In California, SCE retained only its hydroelectric plants, totaling about 1,200 MW, and its 75% share of the 2,150-MW San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, which has been shut down since January 2012; in June 2013 the company announced its intention to permanently close and decommission the nuclear plant. The utility lost all of its natural gas-fired plants, which provided most of its electrical generation. The large, aging plants were bought by out-of-state companies such as Mirant and Reliant Energy, which allegedly used them to manipulate the California energy market.Southern California Edison's power grid is linked to PG&E's by the Path 26 wires that generally follow Interstate 5 over Tejon Pass. The interconnection takes place at a large substation at Buttonwillow. PG&E's and WAPA's Path 15 and Path 66, respectively, from Buttonwillow north eventually connect to BPA's grid in the Pacific Northwest. There are several other interconnections with local and out-of-state utilities, such as Path 46.\nIn addition, SCE operates a regulated gas and water utility. SCE is the sole commercial provider of natural gas and fresh water service to Santa Catalina Island, including the city of Avalon, California. SCE operates the utilities under the names of Catalina Island Gas Company and Catalina Island Water Company.\n\nHistory\nThe origins of the company lie with the grand scheme of business magnate Henry E. Huntington and hydraulic engineer John S. Eastwood, developed around 1908, for a vast complex of reservoirs to be constructed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of central California.  Huntington founded Pacific Light and Power, one of the roughly two dozen companies he controlled at the time, to execute what would eventually become one of the largest hydropower systems in the United States, the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project.  Pacific Light and Power was one of the predecessor companies to SCE, along with Edison Electric, Mt. Whitney Power & Electric Co., California Electric Power Co., Southern California Power Co., and others.\n\nSettlement for blackout\nSouthern California Edison agreed to pay a $650,000 settlement for the 2011 blackout with FERC and NERC.\n\nShooting\nOn December 16, 2011, a shooting occurred when an employee of Southern California Edison opened fire at an office building in Irwindale. The employee killed two co-workers and seriously wounded two others before committing suicide.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nIn March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 8,000 of the 13,000 employees were shifted to remote work. The US Department of Homeland Security has named utilities like SCE part of the 16 sectors designated \u201ccritical infrastructure sectors. The group of remote workers was set up so the company can operate if it faces workforce disruptions or shortages if employees become stricken or quarantined because of COVID-19.\nThe company also ceased power disconnections for non-payment.\n\nRenewable energy\nSouthern California Edison allows its customer to obtain their electricity entirely from renewable sources by subscribing to a \"green rate\".In 2006, Southern California Edison planned to secure 1,500 megawatts or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm area. The contract, which more than doubles SCE's wind energy portfolio, envisions more than 50 square miles (130 km2) of wind parks in the Tehachapi region, which is triple the size of any existing U.S. wind farm.In March 2008, Southern California Edison announced a $875 million project to build a network of 250 megawatts of photovoltaic solar power generation, making it the biggest solar cell project in the nation. The photovoltaic cells will cover 65,000,000 square feet (6,000,000 m2) of rooftops in southern California and will generate enough power to serve 162,000 homes.In 2009, Southern California Edison entered into a contract with Solar Millennium to purchase solar thermal power up to 726 MW. Southern California Edison also entered into a contract with Stirling Energy Systems to buy electricity from a 500 megawatt, 4,600 acre (19 km2), solar power plant which was due to open in 2009. The purchase was canceled in late 2010, as changes in technology reduced the cost of photovoltaic-based solar power to below that of solar Stirling generated power. This would have been the first commercial application of the dish stirling system. A different technology from the more familiar solar panel, the dish concentrates solar energy by the use of reflective surfaces and by the use of the Stirling heat engine to convert the heat into electricity.\nIn 2014, Southern California Edison installed the Tehachapi Energy Storage Project, which is composed of more than 600,000 lithium-ion battery cells at Monolith Substation in Tehachapi, California in order to test storing power generated from an area that currently has 5,000 wind turbines.In 2014 SCE had a renewables mix of 23%. By 2016, 28.2% of SCE's power sources were renewable.\n\nNatural gas and energy storage\nIn 2017, the company opened two new hybrid electric gas turbine (EGT) units called peaker plants, that combine gas turbines and storage batteries at the same site. Each plant delivers around 50-megawatts; the batteries can provide 10-megawatts and four megawatt-hours of power. Both the turbines and the batteries are designed and manufactured by General Electric\u2019s Power Division.The plant runs the battery first in a series of short bursts, saving gas usage for longer power demand. The combination of a 30-minute duration battery improves the environmental impact of the gas turbine.  The SCE setup (the first of its kind) cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, reduced annual water usage by 2 million gallons and lowered the number of gas starts by 50%.\n\nElectric vehicles\nSouthern California Edison has a number of resources and a rate designed specifically for electric vehicle users.As of July 2018, Southern California Edison plans to add thousands of new charging stations for passenger electric vehicles (EV). This addition is a component of the company's \"Charge Ready\" program, a pilot program with the aim of increasing the availability of charging ports for EVs. Since 2016, Southern California Edison has installed 1,000 charging stations throughout their Southern and Central California service area.The company also runs a rebate program for electric vehicle purchases. Southern California Edison gives people in its service area who purchase a new or used, or lease, an electric vehicle a $450 rebate. The program will run until 2020.\n\nEnergy research and policy\nSouthern California Edison has a long history of research in the energy arena. Often this includes working with other companies and government entities. One example is the SOLARII feasibility generator, which was a solar-powered energy plant that could produce electricity 24 hours a day. This was done by heating molten salts that would hold the heat during the day and would be used to generate power at night.Dr. John Jurewitz served as Director of Regulatory Policy for Southern California Edison for 15 years until his retirement in July 2007. His major areas of research are in oil, gas, and electricity policy and greenhouse gas regulation. He has testified and participated in government-sponsored proceedings addressing electric industry restructuring and energy policy at the state, federal, and international levels.In November, 2014, SCE announced a partnership with Ice Energy to provide more efficient energy storage by freezing water at night when electricity is cheaper. (Ice Energy filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2019.)\n\nLabor practice controversy\nIn April 2015, Southern California Edison laid off about 400 IT employees, with an additional 100 IT workers leaving voluntarily. Meanwhile, the utility company hired  immigrants from India through Infosys, based in Bangalore, and Tata Consultancy Services in Mumbai, which are among the largest users of H-1B visas. About 70% of the work to be done by Tata and Infosys will be completed offshore, according to SCE. The company claimed it had to lay off US-based employees to stay competitive. The layoffs were questioned by members of the United States Senate. SCE was subsequently investigated by the US Department of Labor for potential H1-B visa abuse. In October, Department of Labor concluded Infosys did not abuse the H1-B program in the dealings with SCE, while Tata's case remained open.\n\nSee also\nEnergy use in California\nSolar power plants in the Mojave Desert\nWind power in California\nList of articles associated with nuclear issues in California\nPassage 12:\nDunbar Hospital\nThe Dunbar Hospital was the first hospital for the black community in Detroit, Michigan. It is located at 580 Frederick Street, and is currently the administrative headquarters of the Detroit Medical Society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nBuilding construction and description\nThe building housing the Dunbar Hospital was built in 1892 by the Guy W. Vinton Company as a home for real estate developer Charles W. Warren. The home was constructed in a fashionable 19th century residential district.The structure is a three-story home of mixed Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne style, built of red brick and rough-cut ashlar. The entrance is through a recessed, arched first-floor porch and the second story has a double-arch brick balcony. The roof is slate, with a bay-windowed gabled dormer surmounting the front fa\u00e7ade.\n\nFounding of the Dunbar Hospital\nIn 1894, Dr. James W. Ames, a graduate of both Straight University and Howard University, arrived in Detroit after a stint of teaching in New Orleans. He quickly became influential in both Detroit's white community and its then-small black community. Detroit's mayor at the time was Hazen Pingree. During his subsequent re-election campaign, Pingree actively courted the black vote, in part by supporting Ames's bid for election to the Michigan state legislature.The nationally famous black poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, popular in both the black and white community, visited Detroit and lent his voice to those supporting Pingree, penning the poem, \"Vote for Pingree and Vote for Bread.\" Both Ames and Pingree won their respective elections, and Ames spent the next two years in the legislature. He was the last black elected until the 1920s.Two decades later, in the years following World War I, the black population of Detroit soared. In 1910, fewer than 6000 blacks called the city home; in 1917 more than 30,000 blacks lived in Detroit. The increase in black residents led to a crisis in health care. Hospitals were still segregated, and physicians like Ames were required to ask permission to admit black patients. Often black patients were simply denied care. The increase in the black population threatened to overwhelm the city's 30 black doctors.In 1918, Ames led the group of 30 black physicians to form the Allied Medical Society. The area around Frederick street was at the cusp of becoming the center of social and cultural life for Detroit's black community, and the AMS purchased the Warren home on Frederick They opened their own non-profit hospital in the building, the first in the city to serve the black community, as well as an associated nursing school. The hospital was named for the poet Dunbar, who had died in 1906. The hospital had 27 beds and an operating room.\n\nLater history\nIn 1928, demand led Dunbar Hospital to move from its first home to a larger facility several blocks to the east. The facility was renamed Parkside Hospital, and continued in operation until 1962. Soon after Dunbar moved from its home on Frederick, Charles Diggs Sr., who was later the first African-American Democratic state senator, purchased the home. Diggs's son, Charles C. Diggs Jr., served in the Michigan State Senate from 1951 to 1954 and the U.S. House of Representatives from 1954 to 1980. In 1978, the Detroit Medical Society (the successor to the Allied Medical Society) purchased and restored the building. It now serves as their administrative headquarters and a museum.\nPassage 13:\nCampora\nCampora is a town and comune in the province of Salerno, Campania (southern Italy). It is located in the territory of Cilento and as of 2009 its population was 810.\n\nHistory\nGeography\nThe village is located in a hilly area in the middle of Cilento, close to Stio and to the area of Pruno, not far from the town of Vallo della Lucania. It borders with the municipalities of Cannalonga, Gioi, Laurino, Moio della Civitella, Novi Velia and Stio.\n\nSee also\nPruno Cilento\nCilentan language\nCilento and Vallo di Diano National Park\nPassage 14:\nSouthern Maryland Electric Cooperative\nThe Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO) is an electric distribution cooperative which is headquartered in Hughesville, Maryland, United States. SMECO serves approximately 161,000 customers in Calvert, Charles, Prince George's, and St. Mary's counties of southern Maryland. Under its rules as a nonprofit cooperative, SMECO passes on its costs to its customer-members without markup or profit.\n\nHistory\nIn 1937 two committees of citizens from three counties which were seeking aid to construct a local rural electric distribution system under the New Deal's Rural Electrictrification Administration formed the Southern Maryland Tri-County Electric Cooperative Association. This was reorganized as a cooperative under the SMECO name in 1942. Customers were allowed to select suppliers of electricity beginning in 2001 under the Maryland Electric Deregulation legislation enacted in 1999. From 2007 to 2011, SMECO has won the J.D. Power and Associates award for best customer service for a midsize utility.SMECO owned a 77 MW gas turbine generator located at the Chalk Point Generating Station which began operation in 1990 and was operated and maintained by NRG Energy. In 2015 NRG acquired the turbine plant from SMECO.\n\nFERC solar complaint\nSMECO has filed a complaint with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), alleging that the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) coerced utilities into purchasing excess solar power generated by the state's community solar program at much higher retail rates rather than paying the amount it would have cost these utilities to create the power themselves, also known as the avoided cost. This would be in violation with the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which establishes that any payment given to such qualifying power plants equate the utility's avoided cost. In addition, PURPA mandates that these plants do not exceed 80 MW of power.Recently, the development of community solar programs has become increasingly prevalent in order to meet the ever-growing demand for new, viable energy sources; however, there has been much controversy regarding the surge in net metering consumers due to the resulting cost shifts which negatively affect the non-solar community now facing much higher payments to even out the increased benefits given to solar projects.Because of the continual reduction in the cost of power, FERC has become more concerned with the discrepancy between avoided costs and wholesale prices, which continue to prevail. This has placed more focus on PURPA's roles and responsibilities in the maintenance and balance of the current energy market.\nPassage 15:\nPoum\nPoum  is a commune in the North Province of New Caledonia, an overseas territory of France in the Pacific Ocean. The small town of Poum (Latitude: 20\u00b0 13' 59 south, longitude: 164\u00b0 1' 23 east) is located in the far northwest, located on the southern part of Banare Bay, with Mouac Island just offshore. Aside from French, the native language of the Kanak inhabitants is n\u00eal\u00eamwa-nixumwak, an Austronesian language spoken by about 1,100 people. British fishermen came to the islands in 1855 seeking sea cucumbers, and settled and intermarried, and this is reflected in the last names of some clan members and on gravestones (e.g. Williams, Winchester). In the 1850s, a hundred Europeans lived on Mouac Island and John Henry Williams established a presence on N\u00e9ba island.\n\nGeography\nThe Poum massif south of Poum and Titch rises to 414 m and is rich in nickel. Other minerals like cobalt have been mined out. The hills around Poum are bare of trees and distinctively rose and red-tinged. Seasonal water shortages and bush fires are common.\n\nEconomy\nThere is one boarding middle school near Poum village. The Kanak population pursue diverse subsistence activities, sometimes combined with paid work. There is one service station and store, opened in the 2010s. Tourists can stay at a western style hotel complex, the Malabou Beach hotel on Nehoue Bay, which is owned by the Northern Province corporation, Grands H\u00f4tels - it has 35 employees. There are also two tourist cottages (Golone and Poingam),  a campsite (Pagop) and home stays are also possible.Fishing is still pursued mainly by the islanders, especially from Tiabet, although commercial fish sales are affected by the long distances to market in Noum\u00e9a and accreditation systems. Agriculture is practised, and there is some European-owned cattle ranching.\nThe Poum nickel mine was not heavily exploited fully for many years following its acquisition by SLN after the Accords de Bercy in the 1990s, and had about thirty employees in 2014. In 2015, plans to increase production to 100,000 tonnes of ore per year from 'Spur A' of the mine, with 2.5% nickel content, were announced. In 2019, a further announcement of increased production was made. The mine has been accused by the inhabitants of Titch, west of Poum centre, of creating water pollution problems.\nPassage 16:\nMenteng, Menteng\nMenteng is an administrative village in the Menteng district of Indonesia. It has a postal code of 10310. It is located on the southern area of the Menteng Project.\n\nSee also\nList of administrative villages of Jakarta\nPassage 17:\nElk Ridge (Maryland)\nElk Ridge, or Elk Mountain, is a mountain ridge of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Maryland and is the westernmost of four parallel ridges.  It forms the western side of a narrow valley in which are situated the towns of Yarrowsburg and Brownsville.  South Mountain is on the eastern side of this valley running roughly parallel to it.  The ridge runs from Rohrersville, in the north, to the Potomac River across from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, in the south.  Across the Potomac the ridge continues as Blue Ridge Mountain in Virginia and West Virginia.  To the west of Elk Mountain is the broader Cumberland Valley, in which lie the towns of Hagerstown and Chambersburg, and the Potomac River.  The southern end of the ridge, which is part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, is known as Maryland Heights.\n\nHistory\nIn the early 19th century, Elk Ridge was the site of numerous charcoal hearths, which produced charcoal for nearby iron furnaces from wood harvested on the mountain.  More than 50 hearths were constructed between 1810 and 1840.\nThe Maryland Heights portion of Elk Ridge was the scene of much activity during the American Civil War.  Artillery emplacements and fortifications were first erected on the mountain by Union forces in 1862, during Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign.  Later that year, during the Battle of Harpers Ferry, the union fortifications on the mountain were attacked by units under General Lafayette McLaws, who subsequently took control of the ridge and used it to deliver devastating artillery fire against the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry.  After the battle Confederate forces abandoned the ridge to rejoin the Army of Northern Virginia at Antietam and the Union army quickly reoccupied the heights.\nFollowing the Battle of Antietam, Abraham Lincoln came to Maryland to review the army, including the garrisons on the mountain.  He began the ascent, but because of the steepness of the slope, turned around halfway up, concluding any man who could make the climb would pass his muster.  In June 1863 Union forces again took control of the ridge and enlarged the fortifications in response to the Confederate invasion of Maryland during the Gettysburg Campaign.\nThe \"Pinnacle Lot\" of the Maryland Heights was purchased by the Maryland Park System from the grandchildren of the last private owner, Judge Patrick Chapman Savin (1820-1889) of Harper's Ferry, MD; the lot was in turn gifted by the State of Maryland to the National Park Service in the 1950s.  Judge Patrick and his brother, John Chapman Savin, and a future son-in-law, John Marion Marsteller (1841-1898) were among those who participated in the capture of John Brown and his men.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nFrederick Henry, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt\nFrederick Henry, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt (21 August 1709, in Schwedt \u2013 12 December 1788, in Schwedt) was the last owner of the Prussian secundogeniture of Brandenburg-Schwedt.\n\nEarly life\nHis was the son of Margrave Philip William, son of Philip William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt and his wife Sophia Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg. His mother was Princess Johanna Charlotte of Anhalt-Dessau, daughter of Prince John George II of Anhalt-Dessau and Princess Henriette Catherine of Nassau.\n\nLife\nAfter his father's death in 1711, his mother put Frederick Henry under the guardianship of his uncle Frederick I, and after Frederick I's death in 1713, under the guardianship of his cousin Frederick William I.  In 1711, Frederick Henry was made the chief of the Infantry Regiment No. 12.  However, he showed little interest in military affairs.  In 1733, King Frederick William I was so incensed with the disorder in Frederick Henry's regiment that he was jailed for several weeks.  Frederick the Great held little respect for Frederick Henry's abilities and did not employ him.  In 1741, Frederick Henry traded the Infantry Regiment No. 12 for the Infantry Regiment No. 42, but again, he cared little for his duties, and he left its business to the respective commanders.\nWhen his brother Frederick William died in 1771, Frederick Henry inherited the Lordship of Schwedt-Wildenbruch.  As \"Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt\", he was a patron of the arts, especially theater.  In 1755 he acquired the Prinzessinnenpalais in Berlin and in 1785, he contracted the actress Henriette Hendel-Schutz to perform in his Court Theater.\nHe married his first cousin Leopoldine Marie of Anhalt-Dessau, a daughter of Prince Leopold I of Anhalt-Dessau, nicknamed the old Dessauer.  After the birth of two daughters, he and his wife quarreled so often and so violently, that he banned her to Kolberg for the rest of her life.\nBetween 1760 and 1762, the mathematician Leonhard Euler sent numerous letters in French about mathematical and philosophical subjects to his daughter Frederike. These letters were published between 1769 and 1773 under the title \"Letters to a German Princess\" and were printed in Leipzig and St. Petersburg. The French edition alone enjoyed 12 printings. It was the Age of Enlightenment and Euler tried to explain physical issues and in particular their philosophical background in a generally understandable manner. Frederick Henry may have employed Euler as her teacher.When he died in 1788, the junior line of Brandenburg-Schwedt died out and the secundogeniture fell back to the Electorate.  His daughters and nieces received a pension.\n\nDaughters\nLouise of Brandenburg-Schwedt (10 August 1750 \u2013 21 December 1811) married Prince (later Duke) Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau (1740-1817)\nFriederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt (18 August 1745 \u2013 23 January 1808), the last Abbess of Herford Abbey\nPassage 2:\nPrincess Anna Elisabeth Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt\nPrincess and Margravine Anna Elisabeth Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt (German: Luise; 22 April 1738 \u2013 10 February 1820) was a Prussian princess by marriage to her uncle Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia. She was a daughter of Margrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt and Princess Sophia Dorothea of Prussia.\n\nEarly life\nAnna Elisabeth Louise was one of five children born to Margrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt and Sophia Dorothea of Prussia. Her siblings included Sophia Dorothea, Duchess of W\u00fcrttemberg, and Philippine, Landgravine of Hesse-Cassel.\nHer father was a son of Philip William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt and Princess Johanna Charlotte of Anhalt-Dessau.\nHer mother was a daughter of Frederick William I of Prussia and Sophia Dorothea of Hanover. Through her mother, Anna Elisabeth Louise was a niece of Frederick the Great.\n\nPrincess of Prussia\nOn 27 September 1755 in Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin, Anna Elisabeth Louise married her uncle Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia, a younger brother of her mother, Sophia Dorothea. He was eight years older than she and was a younger son of Frederick William I of Prussia and Sophia Dorothea of Hanover (herself the only daughter of George I of Great Britain).\n\nThe biological father of her daughter Louise, who was born in 1770, may have been Count Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau. Louise was described as nice, witty and kind. The Swedish Princess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte described her at the time of her visit in 1798: In the afternoon, we visited this Princess, who lives at Bellevue in the outskirts of Berlin. It is a little villa, very suitable for a private person but far from royal. The reception here was quite dissimilar from the one at my aunt. Princess Ferdinand is stiff and made it obvious that she wished to impress us. I was of course polite, but after I had noticed, that she took on a condescending tone and wished to embarrass me, I replied the same way and displayed the same haughtiness. The Princess is no longer young, has surely been beautiful, looks like an aristocratic Frenchwoman but not like a Princess, for she has nothing royal about her. I do not think she is that clever, but she can make a pleasant conversation and is quite confident, as one becomes through a long habit of socializing in the grand world. \nAnna Elisabeth Louise was one of the few members of the royal house to remain in Berlin during the French occupation in 1806. While most of the royal family left, reportedly because of the anti-Napoleonic criticism they had expressed, and the members of the royal court either followed them or left the capital for their country estates, Elisabeth Louise remained with her spouse and Princess Wilhelmina of Hesse-Kassel because of \"their great age\", as did Princess Augusta of Prussia, who was pregnant at the time.One visitor to her in 1813\u201314 commented that, \"I never saw such a formal, stiff, disagreeable old woman - vieille cour outree, and she frightened me to death. I was glad to get away...\".\n\nDeath\nAugustus Ferdinand died in Berlin on 2 May 1813. Elisabeth Louise died seven years later, on 22 February 1820. She is buried in Berlin Cathedral.\n\nIssue\nOn 27 September 1755 in Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin, Anna Elisabeth Louise married her uncle Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia\nThe couple had seven children:\n\nFriederike Elisabeth Dorothea Henriette Amalie, Princess of Prussia (1761\u20131773)\nFriedrich Heinrich Emil Karl, Prince of Prussia (1769\u20131773)\nFriederike Dorothea Louise Philippine, Princess of Prussia (1770\u20131836), married to Prince Antoni Radziwi\u0142\u0142\nHeinrich Friedrich Carl Ludwig (1771\u20131790)\nFriedrich Ludwig Christian (1772\u20131806)\nFriedrich Paul Heinrich August, Prince of Prussia (1776)\nFriedrich Wilhelm Heinrich August, Prince of Prussia (1779\u20131843)\n\nAncestry\nPassage 3:\nFrederick William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt\nFrederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt (17 November 1700 \u2013 4 March 1771) was a German nobleman. In his lifetime, from 1711 to 1771, he held the titles Prince in Prussia and Margrave of Brandenburg, with the style Royal Highness. He was made a knight of the Order of the Black Eagle.\nIn the 19th century he was retrospectively known by the title Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, in order to differentiate his branch of the Hohenzollern dynasty.  He was the second owner of the Prussian secundogeniture of Brandenburg-Schwedt. His parents were Philip William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, and Princess Johanna Charlotte of Anhalt-Dessau. He was the nephew of King Frederick I of Prussia.\n\nLife\nFrederick William was known as a brutal man because of his short temper, severity, and coarse manners. He was born at Oranienbaum Castle (modern-day Oranienbaum-W\u00f6rlitz, Wittenberg), and was educated and raised by his uncle, King Frederick I, and then by his cousin, King Frederick William I. His character closely resembled that of his second royal guardian, who like himself, hated idleness and was a terror to all loungers. The clergy were especial objects of his ridicule and persecution. His cane was as much feared as that of his royal namesake.He made the fashionable Grand Tour, travelling to Geneva 1715, and in 1716 to Italy. He returned in 1719 to Prussia, where he received the Order of the Black Eagle from Frederick William I. On 15 June 1723 he was made a Prussian major-general. On 10 July 1737 he was appointed lieutenant-general.The existence of the Schwedt branch of the Hohenzollern dynasty, descended as they were from Frederick I's father and being 'princes of the blood', posed a theoretical threat to the Prussian kings.  Frederick William I tried to neutralise this threat by keeping his cousins close, bringing the Schwedt brothers into his own household, acting as their guardian, and later marrying Frederick William to his daughter. Following the margrave's reaching adulthood the king was so fearful of any covert political activity on his cousin's part that he sent spies to Schwedt to find out who met with Frederick William and his brother.Margrave Frederick William pursued a lavish programme of building in Schwedt, both in the palace and town, and he actively purchased land and estates to augment his inheritance; this aggrandisement resulted in the king eventually forbidding him from making any more such purchases. In contrast to his father's policy Frederick II sought to distance himself from his Schwedt cousins, humiliating them at every chance. He made them unwelcome at his court, undermined the margrave's authority in his own dominions by encouraging complaints and lawsuits by his tenants and neighbours and, most effectively, he marginalised the position of the Schwedt brothers within the Prussian army.  Margrave Frederick William was removed from command in the army, a denigration the king also extended to his own brothers.Frederick William was 19 years older than his wife Sophia Dorothea of Prussia, who was his first cousin once removed.  The marriage, in 1734, was at the express wish of King Frederick William, against the wishes of his daughter; the bride was given away by her brother the future Frederick II, as the king was unwell. The relationship of the couple was not happy. Sophia often fled to the protection of her brother King Frederick. The latter did not stop at friendly admonitions, but sent General Meir to Schwedt with unlimited authority to protect the margravine from insult. Eventually they lived in separate places: Sophia lived in the castle Montplaisir, and the Margrave lived in the castle of Schwedt. Apparently they were only reconciled when the margravine was in her terminal illness; she died in her husband's arms.On 4 March 1771, Frederick William died at Wildenbruch Castle, when the heavy cold he was suffering from worsened. The Margrave acknowledged one illegitimate son, the only one of his male offspring to survive infancy. Due to his lack of surviving legitimate male issue, his lands and title were inherited by his younger brother Frederick Henry (ruled 1771\u20131788).\n\nIssue\nIn 1734, the Margrave married Sophia Dorothea of Prussia and they had five children.\nSophia Dorothea (18 December 1736 \u2013 9 March 1798); married Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg\nElisabeth Louise (22 April 1738 \u2013 10 February 1820); married her uncle Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia\nGeorge Philip (10 September 1741 \u2013 28 April 1742)\nPhilippine (10 October 1745 \u2013 1 May 1800); married Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel)\nGeorge Frederick (3 May 1749 \u2013 13 August 1751)He also fathered an illegitimate son named Georg Wilhelm von J\u00e4gersfeld (1725\u20131797).\n\nGenealogy\nFrederick William belonged to a junior branch of the House of Hohenzollern; the senior branch were the Counts of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. The junior line produced electors of Brandenburg and kings and emperors of Prussia and Germany. Frederick William was a descendant of Burkhard I, Count of Zollern. Through his daughter Sophia Dorothea he is an ancestor of Mary of Teck (Queen Mary), the wife of George V, and therefore an ancestor of the present British royal family.\n\nAncestry\nSee also\nFrederick William, Elector of Brandenburg\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nCharles Frederick Albert, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt\nKarl Friedrich Albrecht, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt (10 June 1705 \u2013 22 June 1762), a grandson of Frederick William of Brandenburg (the Great Elector) and son of Margrave Albert Frederick of Brandenburg-Schwedt, was a Prussian military officer and the Herrenmeister (grand master) of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg).\n\nLife\nCharles of Brandenburg-Schwedt was born in Berlin. He joined the Prussian Army at an early age and distinguished himself during the First Silesian War at the capture of G\u0142og\u00f3w, at the Battle of Mollwitz and the Battle of Chotusitz. He took command in Upper Silesia in the spring of 1745, to the special satisfaction of his cousin, King Frederick II of Prussia.\nDuring the Seven Years' War Margrave Charles again held independent commands, as Frederick II had confidence in him, and he distinguished himself at the Battle of Hochkirch and the Battle of Torgau. In both battles, as at Mollwitz, he was wounded.\nThe General German Biography (ADB) describes him as a noble, philanthropic character and lover of the arts and sciences.\nFor 31 years he governed the knights, the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, and its fiefs as Grand Master of the Order of St. John, having been installed at Sonnenburg in 1731. He died in Breslau.\n\nIssue\nCharles Frederick Albert was never married, but had one daughter with his mistress, Dorothea Regina Wuthner (who was raised to the nobility on 14 January 1744 as \"Frau von Carlowitz\"):\n\nCaroline Regina von Carlowitz (Soldin, 12 December 1731 \u2013 Berlin, 16 September 1755), married in Berlin on 16 June 1747 to Count Albrecht Christian von Sch\u00f6nburg-Hinterglauchau (22 January 1720 \u2013 9 March 1799), Charles's adjutant. They had three children:Countess Ernestine Caroline Wilhelmine Albertine of Sch\u00f6nburg-Hinterglauchau (6 June 1748 \u2013 21 March 1810); married in Berlin on 2 November 1770 to Count Frederick Louis Finck von Finckenstein (18 February 1745 \u2013 18 April 1818).\nCount Frederick William Charles Ernest of Sch\u00f6nburg-Hinterglauchau (9 January 1751 \u2013 17 June 1751).\nCount Christian William Charles Frederick Ernest of Sch\u00f6nburg-Hinterglauchau (14 June 1752 \u2013 9 March 1770).In 1744, Charles was engaged to marry Maria Amalia of Hesse-Cassel (1721\u20131744), but she died before they could wed.  Upon his death in 1762, lacking legitimate heirs, his estate reverted to the crown.  After the Treaty of Hubertusburg, Frederick II granted these fortunes to the two officers for whom he had particular gratitude: Hans Sigismund von Lestwitz received the estate of Friedland, and Joachim Bernhard von Prittwitz, who had led the king from the battlefield in the Kunersdorf, received the estate at Quillitz.  Theodore Fontane gave this circumstance a special mention, by quoting a proverb:   \"Lestwitz a sauv\u00e9 l'etat, Prittwitz a sauv\u00e9 le roi.\" (Lestwitz saved the state, Prittwitz the king.) The staff officers of the Lestwitz regiment received a golden medal.\n\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nCharles Philip of Brandenburg-Schwedt\nMargrave Charles Philip of Brandenburg-Schwedt (5 January 1673 in Sparnberg \u2013 23 July 1695 in Casale Monferrato) was a Hohenzollern prince and a titular Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Near the end of his life he became Grand Master of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg).\n\nLife\nCharles Philip was the third surviving son of the \"Great Elector\", Frederick William of Brandenburg (1620\u20131688) from his second marriage with Sophia Dorothea (1636\u20131689), the daughter of Philip, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg.In 1693, Charles Philip proved himself at the Battle of Neerwinden and was promoted to Lieutenant General by his brother Frederick I. He participated in the War of the Palatine Succession at the head of an auxiliary contingent.  He joined the main force of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia in Turin.In Turin, he met Countess Caterina di Salmour (1670-1719), widow of Giovanni Gabaleone, Count di Salmour and daughter of Geofredo Alberico Balbiani, Marchese di Colcavagno by his wife, Marta-Maria Benso di Cavour, heiress of Isolabella. On the afternoon of 29 May 1695 three officers of Brandenburg's army, Col. Ludwig von Blumenthal, Lt. Col. von Hackeborn and Col. von Stille learned that Charles Philipp had lodged in the recently ruined Palace of Venaria, near Turin, where he was about to marry the Countess di Salmour in secret. They hurried towards La Venaria. As they neared the ch\u00e2teau, the Margrave\u2019s Master of the Horse met them on the road and confirmed the rumour. The Margrave had invited a small gathering to his secret wedding, including three women who were friends of the Countess, her brother Flaminio Balbiano, and some local Torino notables; on the German side were a Prince of Hesse-Cassel and a Captain Beaupr\u00e9, currently serving in Brandenburg\u2019s army. The local priest Fr. Galli was summoned, and before him and in the presence of Abbot Alexander del Marro and the Chevalier Parella, they declared their determination to marry. But the priest refused to co-operate on the grounds that they were not his parishioners. The Abbot and Captain Beaupr\u00e9 fought; Staff intervened and the Margrave then fell upon the Master of Horse with drawn sword, who fled.Riding on, the three colonels came upon the Margrave, heading for the Countess\u2019 house in Turin in his carriage with his escort. They joined the cavalcade, and when they reached the destination the Prince\u2019s advisors implored him not to carry on. Neither the Elector of Brandenburg, nor the Duke of Savoy recognized the marriage. To avoid diplomatic complications, Duke Victor Amadeus imprisoned Caterina in a convent. The Curia supported Charles Philip's claim that the marriage was legal, in the hope that he would convert to Catholicism.  While the issue was still being debated, Charles Philip died of a fever or (it was said) of a broken heart. He was buried in the Hohenzollern family crypt in Berlin Cathedral.\nTwo years later, Rome ruled that the marriage was valid.  The Elector still did not recognize it.\nIn 1707, Caterina married the Saxon general Count August Christoph von Wackerbarth.\nPassage 6:\nMargrave Albert Frederick of Brandenburg-Schwedt\nAlbert Frederick, Prince of Prussia, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt (24 January 1672 \u2013 21 June 1731), was a Lieutenant General in the army of the Electorate of Brandenburg-Prussia and Grand Master of the Order of Saint John. In his lifetime he held the courtesy title of Margrave of Brandenburg. His elder brother Philip William held the town and lands of Schwedt.\n\nLife\nAlbert Frederick was born in Berlin, a son of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg and his second wife Sophia Dorothea.  His brother Philip William was from 1692 to 1711 Governor of Magdeburg.  Albrecht Frederick joined the Prussian army as a volunteer in 1689, at the beginning of the War of the Palatine Succession against France.  On 10 May 1692 he became head of a cavalry regiment and on 14 March 1693, he was promoted to major general. In 1694 he participated in the campaign in Italy and was on 9 March 1695, he was promoted to lieutenant general.  The Margrave became in 1696 Grand Master of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg) and, on 17 January 1701, one of the first knights of the Order of the Black Eagle.\nBeginning 14 February 1702 he fought against France as head of an infantry regiment in the War of Spanish Succession as the commander of the Prussian corps in the Netherlands.  In November of that year he had to leave this post because of illness.  In 1706, he was appointed governor in Pomerania. He died at Friedrichsfelde Palace, aged 59.\n\nMarriage and issue\nOn 31 October 1703 Albert Frederick married with Princess Maria Dorothea Ketteler of Courland (1684\u20131743), daughter of Frederick Casimir, Duke of Courland.

Her daughter arranged for a black marble plate in the crypt to commemorate her mother.  In the 1960s, the coffin was cremated, with permission of the Hohenzollern family, and the formerly open-ended crypt (as described by Fontane) was walled off.  Her urn was buried below the black marble plate.\nPassage 8:\nMargrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt (1715\u20131744)\nFrederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt (18 March 1715 \u2013 12 September 1744 in Prague) was a Prussian Major General and commander of the Guards on Foot.

One of her major endeavours was to ensure the financial security of her sons, mostly by the purchase of land. Shortly after the birth of Philip William, he was invested with his mother's dominion of Schwedt, later, the Brandenburg-Prussian government added the lands of Wildenbruch. Both dominions were improved by Princess Dorothea's care and investments. Following the death of his mother, Philip, in an accord of dating to 3 March 1692, reached agreement with his half-brother, the Elector Friedrich III, about income and lands left to him by the Great Elector, including the lordship, without sovereignty, of Halberstadt. Philip received for himself and his descendants guaranteed appanages generating an income of 24,000 thalers each year. Added revenue came in to the amount of 22,000 thalers from the rule of Schwedt, plus military salaries of about 20,000 thalers, so that with a total income of 66,000 crowns he was enabled to hold court, in some style, himself.\nHe held, like all the male members of his house, the courtesy title, Margrave of Brandenburg. After the coronation of his elder brother, Frederick, he became Prince in Prussia, Margrave of Brandenburg with the style Royal Highness. The nomenclature \"Brandenburg-Schwedt\" came into use in the 19th century, posthumously, to distinguish the lords of Schwedt from the main line of the Hohenzollerns. Philip William was the ancestor of the Schwedt branch of the Royal House of Hohenzollern. On 25 January 1699 Philip Wilhelm married Princess Johanna Charlotte of Anhalt-Dessau (1682\u20131750), daughter of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. As a widow she became Abbess of the Imperial Abbey of Herford.\nPhilipp Wilhelm served as a general in the campaigns against France and was promoted in 1697 to Inspector-General of the artillery.

{"context":"Introduction\nOver the past two decades, the emergence of social media has enabled the proliferation of traceable human behavior. The content posted by users can reflect who their friends are, what topics they are interested in, or which company they are working for. At the same time, users are listing a number of profile fields to define themselves to others. The utilization of such metadata has proven important in facilitating further developments of applications in advertising BIBREF0 , personalization BIBREF1 , and recommender systems BIBREF2 . However, profile information can be limited, depending on the platform, or it is often deliberately omitted BIBREF3 . To uncloak this information, a number of studies have utilized social media users' footprints to approximate their profiles.\nThis paper explores the potential of predicting a user's industry \u2013the aggregate of enterprises in a particular field\u2013 by identifying industry indicative text in social media. The accurate prediction of users' industry can have a big impact on targeted advertising by minimizing wasted advertising BIBREF4 and improved personalized user experience. A number of studies in the social sciences have associated language use with social factors such as occupation, social class, education, and income BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 . An additional goal of this paper is to examine such findings, and in particular the link between language and occupational class, through a data-driven approach.\nIn addition, we explore how meaning changes depending on the occupational context. By leveraging word embeddings, we seek to quantify how, for example, cloud might mean a separate concept (e.g., condensed water vapor) in the text written by users that work in environmental jobs while it might be used differently by users in technology occupations (e.g., Internet-based computing).\nSpecifically, this paper makes four main contributions. First, we build a large, industry-annotated dataset that contains over 20,000 blog users. In addition to their posted text, we also link a number of user metadata including their gender, location, occupation, introduction and interests.\nSecond, we build content-based classifiers for the industry prediction task and study the effect of incorporating textual features from the users' profile metadata using various meta-classification techniques, significantly improving both the overall accuracy and the average per industry accuracy.\nNext, after examining which words are indicative for each industry, we build vector-space representations of word meanings and calculate one deviation for each industry, illustrating how meaning is differentiated based on the users' industries. We qualitatively examine the resulting industry-informed semantic representations of words by listing the words per industry that are most similar to job related and general interest terms.\nFinally, we rank the different industries based on the normalized relative frequencies of emotionally charged words (positive and negative) and, in addition, discover that, for both genders, these frequencies do not statistically significantly correlate with an industry's gender dominance ratio.\nAfter discussing related work in Section SECREF2 , we present the dataset used in this study in Section SECREF3 . In Section SECREF4 we evaluate two feature selection methods and examine the industry inference problem using the text of the users' postings. We then augment our content-based classifier by building an ensemble that incorporates several metadata classifiers. We list the most industry indicative words and expose how each industrial semantic field varies with respect to a variety of terms in Section SECREF5 . We explore how the frequencies of emotionally charged words in each gender correlate with the industries and their respective gender dominance ratio and, finally, conclude in Section SECREF6 .\nRelated Work\nAlongside the wide adoption of social media by the public, researchers have been leveraging the newly available data to create and refine models of users' behavior and profiling. There exists a myriad research that analyzes language in order to profile social media users. Some studies sought to characterize users' personality BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , while others sequenced the expressed emotions BIBREF11 , studied mental disorders BIBREF12 , and the progression of health conditions BIBREF13 . At the same time, a number of researchers sought to predict the social media users' age and\/or gender BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , while others targeted and analyzed the ethnicity, nationality, and race of the users BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 . One of the profile fields that has drawn a great deal of attention is the location of a user. Among others, Hecht et al. Hecht11 predicted Twitter users' locations using machine learning on nationwide and state levels. Later, Han et al. Han14 identified location indicative words to predict the location of Twitter users down to the city level.\nAs a separate line of research, a number of studies have focused on discovering the political orientation of users BIBREF15 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 . Finally, Li et al. Li14a proposed a way to model major life events such as getting married, moving to a new place, or graduating. In a subsequent study, BIBREF22 described a weakly supervised information extraction method that was used in conjunction with social network information to identify the name of a user's spouse, the college they attended, and the company where they are employed.\nThe line of work that is most closely related to our research is the one concerned with understanding the relation between people's language and their industry. Previous research from the fields of psychology and economics have explored the potential for predicting one's occupation from their ability to use math and verbal symbols BIBREF23 and the relationship between job-types and demographics BIBREF24 . More recently, Huang et al. Huang15 used machine learning to classify Sina Weibo users to twelve different platform-defined occupational classes highlighting the effect of homophily in user interactions. This work examined only users that have been verified by the Sina Weibo platform, introducing a potential bias in the resulting dataset. Finally, Preotiuc-Pietro et al. Preoctiuc15 predicted the occupational class of Twitter users using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, which groups the different jobs based on skill requirements. In that work, the data collection process was limited to only users that specifically mentioned their occupation in their self-description in a way that could be directly mapped to a SOC occupational class. The mapping between a substring of their self-description and a SOC occupational class was done manually. Because of the manual annotation step, their method was not scalable; moreover, because they identified the occupation class inside a user self-description, only a very small fraction of the Twitter users could be included (in their case, 5,191 users).\nBoth of these recent studies are based on micro-blogging platforms, which inherently restrict the number of characters that a post can have, and consequently the way that users can express themselves.\nMoreover, both studies used off-the-shelf occupational taxonomies (rather than self-declared occupation categories), resulting in classes that are either too generic (e.g., media, welfare and electronic are three of the twelve Sina Weibo categories), or too intermixed (e.g., an assistant accountant is in a different class from an accountant in SOC). To address these limitations, we investigate the industry prediction task in a large blog corpus consisting of over 20K American users, 40K web-blogs, and 560K blog posts.\nDataset\nWe compile our industry-annotated dataset by identifying blogger profiles located in the U.S. on the profile finder on http:\/\/www.blogger.com, and scraping only those users that had the industry profile element completed.\nFor each of these bloggers, we retrieve all their blogs, and for each of these blogs we download the 21 most recent blog postings. We then clean these blog posts of HTML tags and tokenize them, and drop those bloggers whose cumulative textual content in their posts is less than 600 characters. Following these guidelines, we identified all the U.S. bloggers with completed industry information.\nTraditionally, standardized industry taxonomies organize economic activities into groups based on similar production processes, products or services, delivery systems or behavior in financial markets. Following such assumptions and regardless of their many similarities, a tomato farmer would be categorized into a distinct industry from a tobacco farmer. As demonstrated in Preotiuc-Pietro et al. Preoctiuc15 such groupings can cause unwarranted misclassifications.\nThe Blogger platform provides a total of 39 different industry options. Even though a completed industry value is an implicit text annotation, we acknowledge the same problem noted in previous studies: some categories are too broad, while others are very similar. To remedy this and following Guibert et al. Guibert71, who argued that the denominations used in a classification must reflect the purpose of the study, we group the different Blogger industries based on similar educational background and similar technical terminology. To do that, we exclude very general categories and merge conceptually similar ones. Examples of broad categories are the Education and the Student options: a teacher could be teaching in any concentration, while a student could be enrolled in any discipline. Examples of conceptually similar categories are the Investment Banking and the Banking options.\nThe final set of categories is shown in Table TABREF1 , along with the number of users in each category. The resulting dataset consists of 22,880 users, 41,094 blogs, and 561,003 posts. Table TABREF2 presents additional statistics of our dataset.\nText-based Industry Modeling\nAfter collecting our dataset, we split it into three sets: a train set, a development set, and a test set. The sizes of these sets are 17,880, 2,500, and 2,500 users, respectively, with users randomly assigned to these sets. In all the experiments that follow, we evaluate our classifiers by training them on the train set, configure the parameters and measure performance on the development set, and finally report the prediction accuracy and results on the test set. Note that all the experiments are performed at user level, i.e., all the data for one user is compiled into one instance in our data sets.\nTo measure the performance of our classifiers, we use the prediction accuracy. However, as shown in Table TABREF1 , the available data is skewed across categories, which could lead to somewhat distorted accuracy numbers depending on how well a model learns to predict the most populous classes. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide a great deal of insight into the individual performance per industry, which is one of the main objectives in this study. Therefore, in our results below, we report: (1) micro-accuracy ( INLINEFORM0 ), calculated as the percentage of correctly classified instances out of all the instances in the development (test) data; and (2) macro-accuracy ( INLINEFORM1 ), calculated as the average of the per-category accuracies, where the per-category accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified instances out of the instances belonging to one category in the development (test) data.\nLeveraging Blog Content\nIn this section, we seek the effectiveness of using solely textual features obtained from the users' postings to predict their industry.\nThe industry prediction baseline Majority is set by discovering the most frequently featured class in our training set and picking that class in all predictions in the respective development or testing set.\nAfter excluding all the words that are not used by at least three separate users in our training set, we build our AllWords model by counting the frequencies of all the remaining words and training a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. As seen in Figure FIGREF3 , we can far exceed the Majority baseline performance by incorporating basic language signals into machine learning algorithms (173% INLINEFORM0 improvement).\nWe additionally explore the potential of improving our text classification task by applying a number of feature ranking methods and selecting varying proportions of top ranked features in an attempt to exclude noisy features. We start by ranking the different features, w, according to their Information Gain Ratio score (IGR) with respect to every industry, i, and training our classifier using different proportions of the top features. INLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1\nEven though we find that using the top 95% of all the features already exceeds the performance of the All Words model on the development data, we further experiment with ranking our features with a more aggressive formula that heavily promotes the features that are tightly associated with any industry category. Therefore, for every word in our training set, we define our newly introduced ranking method, the Aggressive Feature Ranking (AFR), as: INLINEFORM0\nIn Figure FIGREF3 we illustrate the performance of all four methods in our industry prediction task on the development data. Note that for each method, we provide both the accuracy ( INLINEFORM0 ) and the average per-class accuracy ( INLINEFORM1 ). The Majority and All Words methods apply to all the features; therefore, they are represented as a straight line in the figure. The IGR and AFR methods are applied to varying subsets of the features using a 5% step.\nOur experiments demonstrate that the word choice that the users make in their posts correlates with their industry. The first observation in Figure FIGREF3 is that the INLINEFORM0 is proportional to INLINEFORM1 ; as INLINEFORM2 increases, so does INLINEFORM3 . Secondly, the best result on the development set is achieved by using the top 90% of the features using the AFR method. Lastly, the improvements of the IGR and AFR feature selections are not substantially better in comparison to All Words (at most 5% improvement between All Words and AFR), which suggest that only a few noisy features exist and most of the words play some role in shaping the \u201clanguage\" of an industry.\nAs a final evaluation, we apply on the test data the classifier found to work best on the development data (AFR feature selection, top 90% features), for an INLINEFORM0 of 0.534 and INLINEFORM1 of 0.477.\nLeveraging User Metadata\nTogether with the industry information and the most recent postings of each blogger, we also download a number of accompanying profile elements. Using these additional elements, we explore the potential of incorporating users' metadata in our classifiers.\nTable TABREF7 shows the different user metadata we consider together with their coverage percentage (not all users provide a value for all of the profile elements). With the exception of the gender field, the remaining metadata elements shown in Table TABREF7 are completed by the users as a freely editable text field. This introduces a considerable amount of noise in the set of possible metadata values. Examples of noise in the occupation field include values such as \u201cRetired\u201d, \u201cI work.\u201d, or \u201cmomma\u201d which are not necessarily informative for our industry prediction task.\nTo examine whether the metadata fields can help in the prediction of a user's industry, we build classifiers using the different metadata elements. For each metadata element that has a textual value, we use all the words in the training set for that field as features. The only two exceptions are the state field, which is encoded as one feature that can take one out of 50 different values representing the 50 U.S. states; and the gender field, which is encoded as a feature with a distinct value for each user gender option: undefined, male, or female.\nAs shown in Table TABREF9 , we build four different classifiers using the multinomial NB algorithm: Occu (which uses the words found in the occupation profile element), Intro (introduction), Inter (interests), and Gloc (combined gender, city, state).\nIn general, all the metadata classifiers perform better than our majority baseline ( INLINEFORM0 of 18.88%). For the Gloc classifier, this result is in alignment with previous studies BIBREF24 . However, the only metadata classifier that outperforms the content classifier is the Occu classifier, which despite missing and noisy occupation values exceeds the content classifier's performance by an absolute 3.2%.\nTo investigate the promise of combining the five different classifiers we have built so far, we calculate their inter-prediction agreement using Fleiss's Kappa BIBREF25 , as well as the lower prediction bounds using the double fault measure BIBREF26 . The Kappa values, presented in the lower left side of Table TABREF10 , express the classification agreement for categorical items, in this case the users' industry. Lower values, especially values below 30%, mean smaller agreement. Since all five classifiers have better-than-baseline accuracy, this low agreement suggests that their predictions could potentially be combined to achieve a better accumulated result.\nMoreover, the double fault measure values, which are presented in the top-right hand side of Table TABREF10 , express the proportion of test cases for which both of the two respective classifiers make false predictions, essentially providing the lowest error bound for the pairwise ensemble classifier performance. The lower those numbers are, the greater the accuracy potential of any meta-classification scheme that combines those classifiers. Once again, the low double fault measure values suggest potential gain from a combination of the base classifiers into an ensemble of models.\nAfter establishing the promise of creating an ensemble of classifiers, we implement two meta-classification approaches. First, we combine our classifiers using features concatenation (or early fusion). Starting with our content-based classifier (Text), we successively add the features derived from each metadata element. The results, both micro- and macro-accuracy, are presented in Table TABREF12 . Even though all these four feature concatenation ensembles outperform the content-based classifier in the development set, they fail to outperform the Occu classifier.\nSecond, we explore the potential of using stacked generalization (or late fusion) BIBREF27 . The base classifiers, referred to as L0 classifiers, are trained on different folds of the training set and used to predict the class of the remaining instances. Those predictions are then used together with the true label of the training instances to train a second classifier, referred to as the L1 classifier: this L1 is used to produce the final prediction on both the development data and the test data. Traditionally, stacking uses different machine learning algorithms on the same training data. However in our case, we use the same algorithm (multinomial NB) on heterogeneous data (i.e., different types of data such as content, occupation, introduction, interests, gender, city and state) in order to exploit all available sources of information.\nThe ensemble learning results on the development set are shown in Table TABREF12 . We notice a constant improvement for both metrics when adding more classifiers to our ensemble except for the Gloc classifier, which slightly reduces the performance. The best result is achieved using an ensemble of the Text, Occu, Intro, and Inter L0 classifiers; the respective performance on the test set is an INLINEFORM0 of 0.643 and an INLINEFORM1 of 0.564. Finally, we present in Figure FIGREF11 the prediction accuracy for the final classifier for each of the different industries in our test dataset. Evidently, some industries are easier to predict than others. For example, while the Real Estate and Religion industries achieve accuracy figures above 80%, other industries, such as the Banking industry, are predicted correctly in less than 17% of the time. Anecdotal evidence drawn from the examination of the confusion matrix does not encourage any strong association of the Banking class with any other. The misclassifications are roughly uniform across all other classes, suggesting that the users in the Banking industry use language in a non-distinguishing way.\nQualitative Analysis\nIn this section, we provide a qualitative analysis of the language of the different industries.\nTop-Ranked Words\nTo conduct a qualitative exploration of which words indicate the industry of a user, Table TABREF14 shows the three top-ranking content words for the different industries using the AFR method.\nNot surprisingly, the top ranked words align well with what we would intuitively expect for each industry. Even though most of these words are potentially used by many users regardless of their industry in our dataset, they are still distinguished by the AFR method because of the different frequencies of these words in the text of each industry.\nIndustry-specific Word Similarities\nNext, we examine how the meaning of a word is shaped by the context in which it is uttered. In particular, we qualitatively investigate how the speakers' industry affects meaning by learning vector-space representations of words that take into account such contextual information. To achieve this, we apply the contextualized word embeddings proposed by Bamman et al. Bamman14, which are based on an extension of the \u201cskip-gram\" language model BIBREF28 .\nIn addition to learning a global representation for each word, these contextualized embeddings compute one deviation from the common word embedding representation for each contextual variable, in this case, an industry option. These deviations capture the terms' meaning variations (shifts in the INLINEFORM0 -dimensional space of the representations, where INLINEFORM1 in our experiments) in the text of the different industries, however all the embeddings are in the same vector space to allow for comparisons to one another.\nUsing the word representations learned for each industry, we present in Table TABREF16 the terms in the Technology and the Tourism industries that have the highest cosine similarity with a job-related word, customers. Similarly, Table TABREF17 shows the words in the Environment and the Tourism industries that are closest in meaning to a general interest word, food. More examples are given in the Appendix SECREF8 .\nThe terms that rank highest in each industry are noticeably different. For example, as seen in Table TABREF17 , while food in the Environment industry is similar to nutritionally and locally, in the Tourism industry the same word relates more to terms such as delicious and pastries. These results not only emphasize the existing differences in how people in different industries perceive certain terms, but they also demonstrate that those differences can effectively be captured in the resulting word embeddings.\nEmotional Orientation per Industry and Gender\nAs a final analysis, we explore how words that are emotionally charged relate to different industries. To quantify the emotional orientation of a text, we use the Positive Emotion and Negative Emotion categories in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary BIBREF29 . The LIWC dictionary contains lists of words that have been shown to correlate with the psychological states of people that use them; for example, the Positive Emotion category contains words such as \u201chappy,\u201d \u201cpretty,\u201d and \u201cgood.\u201d\nFor the text of all the users in each industry we measure the frequencies of Positive Emotion and Negative Emotion words normalized by the text's length. Table TABREF20 presents the industries' ranking for both categories of words based on their relative frequencies in the text of each industry.\nWe further perform a breakdown per-gender, where we once again calculate the proportion of emotionally charged words in each industry, but separately for each gender. We find that the industry rankings of the relative frequencies INLINEFORM0 of emotionally charged words for the two genders are statistically significantly correlated, which suggests that regardless of their gender, users use positive (or negative) words with a relative frequency that correlates with their industry. (In other words, even if e.g., Fashion has a larger number of women users, both men and women working in Fashion will tend to use more positive words than the corresponding gender in another industry with a larger number of men users such as Automotive.)\nFinally, motivated by previous findings of correlations between job satisfaction and gender dominance in the workplace BIBREF30 , we explore the relationship between the usage of Positive Emotion and Negative Emotion words and the gender dominance in an industry. Although we find that there are substantial gender imbalances in each industry (Appendix SECREF9 ), we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the gender dominance ratio in the different industries and the usage of positive (or negative) emotional words in either gender in our dataset.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we examined the task of predicting a social media user's industry. We introduced an annotated dataset of over 20,000 blog users and applied a content-based classifier in conjunction with two feature selection methods for an overall accuracy of up to 0.534, which represents a large improvement over the majority class baseline of 0.188.\nWe also demonstrated how the user metadata can be incorporated in our classifiers. Although concatenation of features drawn both from blog content and profile elements did not yield any clear improvements over the best individual classifiers, we found that stacking improves the prediction accuracy to an overall accuracy of 0.643, as measured on our test dataset. A more in-depth analysis showed that not all industries are equally easy to predict: while industries such as Real Estate and Religion are clearly distinguishable with accuracy figures over 0.80, others such as Banking are much harder to predict.\nFinally, we presented a qualitative analysis to provide some insights into the language of different industries, which highlighted differences in the top-ranked words in each industry, word semantic similarities, and the relative frequency of emotionally charged words.\nAcknowledgments\nThis material is based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (#1344257) and by the John Templeton Foundation (#48503).

But each one has its proper hour in a conversation--you know\nthe pretty jest recorded by Chamfort, and said to the Duc de Fronsac:\n'Between your sally and the present moment lie ten bottles of\nchampagne.'\"\n\n\"But it is two in the morning, and the story of Rosina has prepared us,\"\nsaid the mistress of the house.\n\n\"Tell us, Monsieur Bianchon!\" was the cry on every side.\n\nThe obliging doctor bowed, and silence reigned.\n\n\"At about a hundred paces from Vendome, on the banks of the Loir,\" said\nhe, \"stands an old brown house, crowned with very high roofs, and so\ncompletely isolated that there is nothing near it, not even a fetid\ntannery or a squalid tavern, such as are commonly seen outside small\ntowns. In front of this house is a garden down to the river, where the\nbox shrubs, formerly clipped close to edge the walks, now straggle\nat their own will. A few willows, rooted in the stream, have grown\nup quickly like an enclosing fence, and half hide the house. The\nwild plants we call weeds have clothed the bank with their beautiful\nluxuriance. The fruit-trees, neglected for these ten years past,\nno longer bear a crop, and their suckers have formed a thicket. The\nespaliers are like a copse. The paths, once graveled, are overgrown with\npurslane; but, to be accurate there is no trace of a path.\n\n\"Looking down from the hilltop, to which cling the ruins of the old\ncastle of the Dukes of Vendome, the only spot whence the eye can\nsee into this enclosure, we think that at a time, difficult now to\ndetermine, this spot of earth must have been the joy of some country\ngentleman devoted to roses and tulips, in a word, to horticulture, but\nabove all a lover of choice fruit. An arbor is visible, or rather\nthe wreck of an arbor, and under it a table still stands not entirely\ndestroyed by time. At the aspect of this garden that is no more, the\nnegative joys of the peaceful life of the provinces may be divined as we\ndivine the history of a worthy tradesman when we read the epitaph on his\ntomb. To complete the mournful and tender impressions which seize the\nsoul, on one of the walls there is a sundial graced with this homely\nChristian motto, '_Ultimam cogita_.'\n\n\"The roof of this house is dreadfully dilapidated; the outside shutters\nare always closed; the balconies are hung with swallows' nests; the\ndoors are for ever shut. Straggling grasses have outlined the flagstones\nof the steps with green; the ironwork is rusty. Moon and sun, winter,\nsummer, and snow have eaten into the wood, warped the boards, peeled\noff the paint. The dreary silence is broken only by birds and cats,\npolecats, rats, and mice, free to scamper round, and fight, and eat each\nother. An invisible hand has written over it all: 'Mystery.'\n\n\"If, prompted by curiosity, you go to look at this house from the\nstreet, you will see a large gate, with a round-arched top; the children\nhave made many holes in it. I learned later that this door had been\nblocked for ten years. Through these irregular breaches you will see\nthat the side towards the courtyard is in perfect harmony with the side\ntowards the garden. The same ruin prevails. Tufts of weeds outline\nthe paving-stones; the walls are scored by enormous cracks, and the\nblackened coping is laced with a thousand festoons of pellitory. The\nstone steps are disjointed; the bell-cord is rotten; the gutter-spouts\nbroken. What fire from heaven could have fallen there? By what decree\nhas salt been sown on this dwelling? Has God been mocked here? Or was\nFrance betrayed? These are the questions we ask ourselves. Reptiles\ncrawl over it, but give no reply. This empty and deserted house is a\nvast enigma of which the answer is known to none.\n\n\"It was formerly a little domain, held in fief, and is known as La\nGrande Breteche. During my stay at Vendome, where Despleins had left me\nin charge of a rich patient, the sight of this strange dwelling became\none of my keenest pleasures. Was it not far better than a ruin? Certain\nmemories of indisputable authenticity attach themselves to a ruin; but\nthis house, still standing, though being slowly destroyed by an avenging\nhand, contained a secret, an unrevealed thought. At the very least,\nit testified to a caprice. More than once in the evening I boarded the\nhedge, run wild, which surrounded the enclosure. I braved scratches, I\ngot into this ownerless garden, this plot which was no longer public or\nprivate; I lingered there for hours gazing at the disorder. I would not,\nas the price of the story to which this strange scene no doubt was due,\nhave asked a single question of any gossiping native. On that spot I\nwove delightful romances, and abandoned myself to little debauches of\nmelancholy which enchanted me. If I had known the reason--perhaps quite\ncommonplace--of this neglect, I should have lost the unwritten poetry\nwhich intoxicated me. To me this refuge represented the most various\nphases of human life, shadowed by misfortune; sometimes the peace of the\ngraveyard without the dead, who speak in the language of epitaphs; one\nday I saw in it the home of lepers; another, the house of the Atridae;\nbut, above all, I found there provincial life, with its contemplative\nideas, its hour-glass existence. I often wept there, I never laughed.\n\n\"More than once I felt involuntary terrors as I heard overhead the dull\nhum of the wings of some hurrying wood-pigeon. The earth is dank; you\nmust be on the watch for lizards, vipers, and frogs, wandering about\nwith the wild freedom of nature; above all, you must have no fear\nof cold, for in a few moments you feel an icy cloak settle on your\nshoulders, like the Commendatore's hand on Don Giovanni's neck.\n\n\"One evening I felt a shudder; the wind had turned an old rusty\nweathercock, and the creaking sounded like a cry from the house, at\nthe very moment when I was finishing a gloomy drama to account for\nthis monumental embodiment of woe. I returned to my inn, lost in gloomy\nthoughts. When I had supped, the hostess came into my room with an air\nof mystery, and said, 'Monsieur, here is Monsieur Regnault.'\n\n\"'Who is Monsieur Regnault?'\n\n\"'What, sir, do you not know Monsieur Regnault?--Well, that's odd,' said\nshe, leaving the room.\n\n\"On a sudden I saw a man appear, tall, slim, dressed in black, hat\nin hand, who came in like a ram ready to butt his opponent, showing a\nreceding forehead, a small pointed head, and a colorless face of the hue\nof a glass of dirty water. You would have taken him for an usher. The\nstranger wore an old coat, much worn at the seams; but he had a diamond\nin his shirt frill, and gold rings in his ears.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said I, 'whom have I the honor of addressing?'--He took a\nchair, placed himself in front of my fire, put his hat on my table,\nand answered while he rubbed his hands: 'Dear me, it is very\ncold.--Monsieur, I am Monsieur Regnault.'\n\n\"I was encouraging myself by saying to myself, '_Il bondo cani!_ Seek!'\n\n\"'I am,' he went on, 'notary at Vendome.'\n\n\"'I am delighted to hear it, monsieur,' I exclaimed. 'But I am not in a\nposition to make a will for reasons best known to myself.'\n\n\"'One moment!' said he, holding up his hand as though to gain silence.\n'Allow me, monsieur, allow me! I am informed that you sometimes go to\nwalk in the garden of la Grande Breteche.'\n\n\"'Yes, monsieur.'\n\n\"'One moment!' said he, repeating his gesture. 'That constitutes a\nmisdemeanor. Monsieur, as executor under the will of the late Comtesse\nde Merret, I come in her name to beg you to discontinue the practice.\nOne moment! I am not a Turk, and do not wish to make a crime of it. And\nbesides, you are free to be ignorant of the circumstances which\ncompel me to leave the finest mansion in Vendome to fall into ruin.\nNevertheless, monsieur, you must be a man of education, and you should\nknow that the laws forbid, under heavy penalties, any trespass on\nenclosed property. A hedge is the same as a wall. But, the state in\nwhich the place is left may be an excuse for your curiosity. For my\npart, I should be quite content to make you free to come and go in the\nhouse; but being bound to respect the will of the testatrix, I have\nthe honor, monsieur, to beg that you will go into the garden no more.\nI myself, monsieur, since the will was read, have never set foot in the\nhouse, which, as I had the honor of informing you, is part of the estate\nof the late Madame de Merret. We have done nothing there but verify the\nnumber of doors and windows to assess the taxes I have to pay annually\nout of the funds left for that purpose by the late Madame de Merret. Ah!\nmy dear sir, her will made a great commotion in the town.'\n\n\"The good man paused to blow his nose. I respected his volubility,\nperfectly understanding that the administration of Madame de Merret's\nestate had been the most important event of his life, his reputation,\nhis glory, his Restoration. As I was forced to bid farewell to my\nbeautiful reveries and romances, I was to reject learning the truth on\nofficial authority.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said I, 'would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you the\nreasons for such eccentricity?'\n\n\"At these words an expression, which revealed all the pleasure which\nmen feel who are accustomed to ride a hobby, overspread the lawyer's\ncountenance. He pulled up the collar of his shirt with an air, took out\nhis snuffbox, opened it, and offered me a pinch; on my refusing, he took\na large one. He was happy! A man who has no hobby does not know all\nthe good to be got out of life. A hobby is the happy medium between a\npassion and a monomania. At this moment I understood the whole bearing\nof Sterne's charming passion, and had a perfect idea of the delight with\nwhich my uncle Toby, encouraged by Trim, bestrode his hobby-horse.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said Monsieur Regnault, 'I was head-clerk in Monsieur\nRoguin's office, in Paris. A first-rate house, which you may have heard\nmentioned? No! An unfortunate bankruptcy made it famous.--Not having\nmoney enough to purchase a practice in Paris at the price to which they\nwere run up in 1816, I came here and bought my predecessor's business.\nI had relations in Vendome; among others, a wealthy aunt, who allowed\nme to marry her daughter.--Monsieur,' he went on after a little pause,\n'three months after being licensed by the Keeper of the Seals, one\nevening, as I was going to bed--it was before my marriage--I was sent\nfor by Madame la Comtesse de Merret, to her Chateau of Merret. Her maid,\na good girl, who is now a servant in this inn, was waiting at my door\nwith the Countess' own carriage. Ah! one moment! I ought to tell you\nthat Monsieur le Comte de Merret had gone to Paris to die two months\nbefore I came here. He came to a miserable end, flinging himself into\nevery kind of dissipation. You understand?\n\n\"'On the day when he left, Madame la Comtesse had quitted la Grand\nBreteche, having dismantled it. Some people even say that she had\nburnt all the furniture, the hangings--in short, all the chattels and\nfurniture whatever used in furnishing the premises now let by the\nsaid M.--(Dear, what am I saying? I beg your pardon, I thought I was\ndictating a lease.)--In short, that she burnt everything in the meadow\nat Merret. Have you been to Merret, monsieur?--No,' said he, answering\nhimself, 'Ah, it is a very fine place.'\n\n\"'For about three months previously,' he went on, with a jerk of his\nhead, 'the Count and Countess had lived in a very eccentric way; they\nadmitted no visitors; Madame lived on the ground-floor, and Monsieur on\nthe first floor. When the Countess was left alone, she was never seen\nexcepting at church. Subsequently, at home, at the chateau, she refused\nto see the friends, whether gentlemen or ladies, who went to call on\nher. She was already very much altered when she left la Grande Breteche\nto go to Merret. That dear lady--I say dear lady, for it was she who\ngave me this diamond, but indeed I saw her but once--that kind lady was\nvery ill; she had, no doubt, given up all hope, for she died without\nchoosing to send for a doctor; indeed, many of our ladies fancied she\nwas not quite right in her head. Well, sir, my curiosity was strangely\nexcited by hearing that Madame de Merret had need of my services. Nor\nwas I the only person who took an interest in the affair. That very\nnight, though it was already late, all the town knew that I was going to\nMerret.\n\n\"'The waiting-woman replied but vaguely to the questions I asked her on\nthe way; nevertheless, she told me that her mistress had received the\nSacrament in the course of the day at the hands of the Cure of Merret,\nand seemed unlikely to live through the night. It was about eleven when\nI reached the chateau. I went up the great staircase. After crossing\nsome large, lofty, dark rooms, diabolically cold and damp, I reached the\nstate bedroom where the Countess lay. From the rumors that were current\nconcerning this lady (monsieur, I should never end if I were to repeat\nall the tales that were told about her), I had imagined her a coquette.\nImagine, then, that I had great difficulty in seeing her in the great\nbed where she was lying. To be sure, to light this enormous room, with\nold-fashioned heavy cornices, and so thick with dust that merely to see\nit was enough to make you sneeze, she had only an old Argand lamp. Ah!\nbut you have not been to Merret. Well, the bed is one of those old world\nbeds, with a high tester hung with flowered chintz. A small table stood\nby the bed, on which I saw an \"Imitation of Christ,\" which, by the\nway, I bought for my wife, as well as the lamp. There were also a deep\narmchair for her confidential maid, and two small chairs. There was no\nfire. That was all the furniture, not enough to fill ten lines in an\ninventory.\n\n\"'My dear sir, if you had seen, as I then saw, that vast room, papered\nand hung with brown, you would have felt yourself transported into a\nscene of a romance. It was icy, nay more, funereal,' and he lifted his\nhand with a theatrical gesture and paused.\n\n\"'By dint of seeking, as I approached the bed, at last I saw Madame de\nMerret, under the glimmer of the lamp, which fell on the pillows.\nHer face was as yellow as wax, and as narrow as two folded hands. The\nCountess had a lace cap showing her abundant hair, but as white as linen\nthread. She was sitting up in bed, and seemed to keep upright with\ngreat difficulty. Her large black eyes, dimmed by fever, no doubt,\nand half-dead already, hardly moved under the bony arch of her\neyebrows.--There,' he added, pointing to his own brow. 'Her forehead was\nclammy; her fleshless hands were like bones covered with soft skin;\nthe veins and muscles were perfectly visible. She must have been very\nhandsome; but at this moment I was startled into an indescribable\nemotion at the sight. Never, said those who wrapped her in her shroud,\nhad any living creature been so emaciated and lived. In short, it was\nawful to behold! Sickness so consumed that woman, that she was no more\nthan a phantom. Her lips, which were pale violet, seemed to me not to\nmove when she spoke to me.\n\n\"'Though my profession has familiarized me with such spectacles, by\ncalling me not infrequently to the bedside of the dying to record their\nlast wishes, I confess that families in tears and the agonies I have\nseen were as nothing in comparison with this lonely and silent woman in\nher vast chateau. I heard not the least sound, I did not perceive the\nmovement which the sufferer's breathing ought to have given to the\nsheets that covered her, and I stood motionless, absorbed in looking at\nher in a sort of stupor. In fancy I am there still. At last her large\neyes moved; she tried to raise her right hand, but it fell back on the\nbed, and she uttered these words, which came like a breath, for her\nvoice was no longer a voice: \"I have waited for you with the greatest\nimpatience.\" A bright flush rose to her cheeks. It was a great effort to\nher to speak.\n\n\"'\"Madame,\" I began. She signed to me to be silent. At that moment\nthe old housekeeper rose and said in my ear, \"Do not speak; Madame la\nComtesse is not in a state to bear the slightest noise, and what you say\nmight agitate her.\"\n\n\"'I sat down. A few instants after, Madame de Merret collected all her\nremaining strength to move her right hand, and slipped it, not without\ninfinite difficulty, under the bolster; she then paused a moment. With\na last effort she withdrew her hand; and when she brought out a sealed\npaper, drops of perspiration rolled from her brow. \"I place my will in\nyour hands--Oh! God! Oh!\" and that was all. She clutched a crucifix that\nlay on the bed, lifted it hastily to her lips, and died.\n\n\"'The expression of her eyes still makes me shudder as I think of it.\nShe must have suffered much! There was joy in her last glance, and it\nremained stamped on her dead eyes.\n\n\"'I brought away the will, and when it was opened I found that Madame de\nMerret had appointed me her executor. She left the whole of her property\nto the hospital at Vendome excepting a few legacies. But these were her\ninstructions as relating to la Grande Breteche: She ordered me to leave\nthe place, for fifty years counting from the day of her death, in the\nstate in which it might be at the time of her death, forbidding any one,\nwhoever he might be, to enter the apartments, prohibiting any repairs\nwhatever, and even settling a salary to pay watchmen if it were needful\nto secure the absolute fulfilment of her intentions. At the expiration\nof that term, if the will of the testatrix has been duly carried out,\nthe house is to become the property of my heirs, for, as you know, a\nnotary cannot take a bequest. Otherwise la Grande Breteche reverts to\nthe heirs-at-law, but on condition of fulfilling certain conditions\nset forth in a codicil to the will, which is not to be opened till\nthe expiration of the said term of fifty years. The will has not been\ndisputed, so----' And without finishing his sentence, the lanky notary\nlooked at me with an air of triumph; I made him quite happy by offering\nhim my congratulations.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' I said in conclusion, 'you have so vividly impressed\nme that I fancy I see the dying woman whiter than her sheets; her\nglittering eyes frighten me; I shall dream of her to-night.--But you\nmust have formed some idea as to the instructions contained in that\nextraordinary will.'\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said he, with comical reticence, 'I never allow myself\nto criticise the conduct of a person who honors me with the gift of a\ndiamond.'\n\n\"However, I soon loosened the tongue of the discreet notary of Vendome,\nwho communicated to me, not without long digressions, the opinions of\nthe deep politicians of both sexes whose judgments are law in Vendome.\nBut these opinions were so contradictory, so diffuse, that I was\nnear falling asleep in spite of the interest I felt in this authentic\nhistory. The notary's ponderous voice and monotonous accent, accustomed\nno doubt to listen to himself and to make himself listened to by his\nclients or fellow-townsmen, were too much for my curiosity. Happily, he\nsoon went away.\n\n\"'Ah, ha, monsieur,' said he on the stairs, 'a good many persons would\nbe glad to live five-and-forty years longer; but--one moment!' and he\nlaid the first finger of his right hand to his nostril with a cunning\nlook, as much as to say, 'Mark my words!--To last as long as that--as\nlong as that,' said he, 'you must not be past sixty now.'\n\n\"I closed my door, having been roused from my apathy by this last\nspeech, which the notary thought very funny; then I sat down in my\narmchair, with my feet on the fire-dogs. I had lost myself in a romance\n_a la_ Radcliffe, constructed on the juridical base given me by Monsieur\nRegnault, when the door, opened by a woman's cautious hand, turned on\nthe hinges. I saw my landlady come in, a buxom, florid dame, always\ngood-humored, who had missed her calling in life. She was a Fleming, who\nought to have seen the light in a picture by Teniers.\n\n\"'Well, monsieur,' said she, 'Monsieur Regnault has no doubt been giving\nyou his history of la Grande Breteche?'\n\n\"'Yes, Madame Lepas.'\n\n\"'And what did he tell you?'\n\n\"I repeated in a few words the creepy and sinister story of Madame de\nMerret. At each sentence my hostess put her head forward, looking at\nme with an innkeeper's keen scrutiny, a happy compromise between the\ninstinct of a police constable, the astuteness of a spy, and the cunning\nof a dealer.\n\n\"'My good Madame Lepas,' said I as I ended, 'you seem to know more about\nit. Heh? If not, why have you come up to me?'\n\n\"'On my word, as an honest woman----'\n\n\"'Do not swear; your eyes are big with a secret. You knew Monsieur de\nMerret; what sort of man was he?'\n\n\"'Monsieur de Merret--well, you see he was a man you never could see\nthe top of, he was so tall! A very good gentleman, from Picardy, and who\nhad, as we say, his head close to his cap. He paid for everything down,\nso as never to have difficulties with any one. He was hot-tempered, you\nsee! All our ladies liked him very much.'\n\n\"'Because he was hot-tempered?' I asked her.\n\n\"'Well, may be,' said she; 'and you may suppose, sir, that a man had to\nhave something to show for a figurehead before he could marry Madame de\nMerret, who, without any reflection on others, was the handsomest and\nrichest heiress in our parts. She had about twenty thousand francs\na year. All the town was at the wedding; the bride was pretty and\nsweet-looking, quite a gem of a woman. Oh, they were a handsome couple\nin their day!'\n\n\"'And were they happy together?'\n\n\"'Hm, hm! so-so--so far as can be guessed, for, as you may suppose, we\nof the common sort were not hail-fellow-well-met with them.--Madame de\nMerret was a kind woman and very pleasant, who had no doubt sometimes to\nput up with her husband's tantrums. But though he was rather haughty, we\nwere fond of him. After all, it was his place to behave so. When a man\nis a born nobleman, you see----'\n\n\"'Still, there must have been some catastrophe for Monsieur and Madame\nde Merret to part so violently?'\n\n\"'I did not say there was any catastrophe, sir. I know nothing about\nit.'\n\n\"'Indeed. Well, now, I am sure you know everything.'\n\n\"'Well, sir, I will tell you the whole story.--When I saw Monsieur\nRegnault go up to see you, it struck me that he would speak to you about\nMadame de Merret as having to do with la Grande Breteche. That put it\ninto my head to ask your advice, sir, seeming to me that you are a\nman of good judgment and incapable of playing a poor woman like me\nfalse--for I never did any one a wrong, and yet I am tormented by my\nconscience. Up to now I have never dared to say a word to the people of\nthese parts; they are all chatter-mags, with tongues like knives. And\nnever till now, sir, have I had any traveler here who stayed so long in\nthe inn as you have, and to whom I could tell the history of the fifteen\nthousand francs----'\n\n\"'My dear Madame Lepas, if there is anything in your story of a nature\nto compromise me,' I said, interrupting the flow of her words, 'I would\nnot hear it for all the world.'\n\n\"'You need have no fears,' said she; 'you will see.'\n\n\"Her eagerness made me suspect that I was not the only person to whom\nmy worthy landlady had communicated the secret of which I was to be the\nsole possessor, but I listened.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' said she, 'when the Emperor sent the Spaniards here,\nprisoners of war and others, I was required to lodge at the charge\nof the Government a young Spaniard sent to Vendome on parole.\nNotwithstanding his parole, he had to show himself every day to the\nsub-prefect. He was a Spanish grandee--neither more nor less. He had\na name in _os_ and _dia_, something like Bagos de Feredia. I wrote his\nname down in my books, and you may see it if you like. Ah! he was a\nhandsome young fellow for a Spaniard, who are all ugly they say. He was\nnot more than five feet two or three in height, but so well made; and he\nhad little hands that he kept so beautifully! Ah! you should have\nseen them. He had as many brushes for his hands as a woman has for her\ntoilet. He had thick, black hair, a flame in his eye, a somewhat coppery\ncomplexion, but which I admired all the same. He wore the finest linen\nI have ever seen, though I have had princesses to lodge here, and, among\nothers, General Bertrand, the Duc and Duchesse d'Abrantes, Monsieur\nDescazes, and the King of Spain. He did not eat much, but he had such\npolite and amiable ways that it was impossible to owe him a grudge for\nthat. Oh! I was very fond of him, though he did not say four words to me\nin a day, and it was impossible to have the least bit of talk with him;\nif he was spoken to, he did not answer; it is a way, a mania they all\nhave, it would seem.\n\n\"'He read his breviary like a priest, and went to mass and all the\nservices quite regularly. And where did he post himself?--we found this\nout later.--Within two yards of Madame de Merret's chapel. As he took\nthat place the very first time he entered the church, no one imagined\nthat there was any purpose in it. Besides, he never raised his nose\nabove his book, poor young man! And then, monsieur, of an evening he\nwent for a walk on the hill among the ruins of the old castle. It was\nhis only amusement, poor man; it reminded him of his native land. They\nsay that Spain is all hills!\n\n\"'One evening, a few days after he was sent here, he was out very late.\nI was rather uneasy when he did not come in till just on the stroke of\nmidnight; but we all got used to his whims; he took the key of the door,\nand we never sat up for him. He lived in a house belonging to us in the\nRue des Casernes. Well, then, one of our stable-boys told us one evening\nthat, going down to wash the horses in the river, he fancied he had seen\nthe Spanish Grandee swimming some little way off, just like a fish. When\nhe came in, I told him to be careful of the weeds, and he seemed put out\nat having been seen in the water.\n\n\"'At last, monsieur, one day, or rather one morning, we did not find\nhim in his room; he had not come back. By hunting through his things, I\nfound a written paper in the drawer of his table, with fifty pieces of\nSpanish gold of the kind they call doubloons, worth about five thousand\nfrancs; and in a little sealed box ten thousand francs worth of\ndiamonds. The paper said that in case he should not return, he left us\nthis money and these diamonds in trust to found masses to thank God for\nhis escape and for his salvation.\n\n\"'At that time I still had my husband, who ran off in search of him.\nAnd this is the queer part of the story: he brought back the Spaniard's\nclothes, which he had found under a big stone on a sort of breakwater\nalong the river bank, nearly opposite la Grande Breteche. My husband\nwent so early that no one saw him. After reading the letter, he burnt\nthe clothes, and, in obedience to Count Feredia's wish, we announced\nthat he had escaped.\n\n\"'The sub-prefect set all the constabulary at his heels; but, pshaw! he\nwas never caught. Lepas believed that the Spaniard had drowned himself.\nI, sir, have never thought so; I believe, on the contrary, that he had\nsomething to do with the business about Madame de Merret, seeing that\nRosalie told me that the crucifix her mistress was so fond of that she\nhad it buried with her, was made of ebony and silver; now in the early\ndays of his stay here, Monsieur Feredia had one of ebony and silver\nwhich I never saw later.--And now, monsieur, do not you say that I need\nhave no remorse about the Spaniard's fifteen thousand francs? Are they\nnot really and truly mine?'\n\n\"'Certainly.--But have you never tried to question Rosalie?' said I.\n\n\"'Oh, to be sure I have, sir. But what is to be done? That girl is like\na wall. She knows something, but it is impossible to make her talk.'\n\n\"After chatting with me for a few minutes, my hostess left me a prey\nto vague and sinister thoughts, to romantic curiosity, and a religious\ndread, not unlike the deep emotion which comes upon us when we go into a\ndark church at night and discern a feeble light glimmering under a lofty\nvault--a dim figure glides across--the sweep of a gown or of a priest's\ncassock is audible--and we shiver! La Grande Breteche, with its rank\ngrasses, its shuttered windows, its rusty iron-work, its locked doors,\nits deserted rooms, suddenly rose before me in fantastic vividness. I\ntried to get into the mysterious dwelling to search out the heart of\nthis solemn story, this drama which had killed three persons.\n\n\"Rosalie became in my eyes the most interesting being in Vendome. As\nI studied her, I detected signs of an inmost thought, in spite of the\nblooming health that glowed in her dimpled face. There was in her soul\nsome element of ruth or of hope; her manner suggested a secret, like\nthe expression of devout souls who pray in excess, or of a girl who has\nkilled her child and for ever hears its last cry. Nevertheless, she was\nsimple and clumsy in her ways; her vacant smile had nothing criminal\nin it, and you would have pronounced her innocent only from seeing the\nlarge red and blue checked kerchief that covered her stalwart bust,\ntucked into the tight-laced bodice of a lilac- and white-striped gown.\n'No,' said I to myself, 'I will not quit Vendome without knowing the\nwhole history of la Grande Breteche. To achieve this end, I will make\nlove to Rosalie if it proves necessary.'\n\n\"'Rosalie!' said I one evening.\n\n\"'Your servant, sir?'\n\n\"'You are not married?' She started a little.\n\n\"'Oh! there is no lack of men if ever I take a fancy to be miserable!'\nshe replied, laughing. She got over her agitation at once; for every\nwoman, from the highest lady to the inn-servant inclusive, has a native\npresence of mind.\n\n\"'Yes; you are fresh and good-looking enough never to lack lovers! But\ntell me, Rosalie, why did you become an inn-servant on leaving Madame de\nMerret? Did she not leave you some little annuity?'\n\n\"'Oh yes, sir. But my place here is the best in all the town of\nVendome.'\n\n\"This reply was such an one as judges and attorneys call evasive.\nRosalie, as it seemed to me, held in this romantic affair the place of\nthe middle square of the chess-board: she was at the very centre of the\ninterest and of the truth; she appeared to me to be tied into the knot\nof it. It was not a case for ordinary love-making; this girl contained\nthe last chapter of a romance, and from that moment all my attentions\nwere devoted to Rosalie. By dint of studying the girl, I observed in\nher, as in every woman whom we make our ruling thought, a variety of\ngood qualities; she was clean and neat; she was handsome, I need not\nsay; she soon was possessed of every charm that desire can lend to a\nwoman in whatever rank of life. A fortnight after the notary's visit,\none evening, or rather one morning, in the small hours, I said to\nRosalie:\n\n\"'Come, tell me all you know about Madame de Merret.'\n\n\"'Oh!' she said, 'I will tell you; but keep the secret carefully.'\n\n\"'All right, my child; I will keep all your secrets with a thief's\nhonor, which is the most loyal known.'\n\n\"'If it is all the same to you,' said she, 'I would rather it should be\nwith your own.'\n\n\"Thereupon she set her head-kerchief straight, and settled herself to\ntell the tale; for there is no doubt a particular attitude of confidence\nand security is necessary to the telling of a narrative. The best tales\nare told at a certain hour--just as we are all here at table. No one\never told a story well standing up, or fasting.\n\n\"If I were to reproduce exactly Rosalie's diffuse eloquence, a whole\nvolume would scarcely contain it. Now, as the event of which she gave me\na confused account stands exactly midway between the notary's gossip and\nthat of Madame Lepas, as precisely as the middle term of a rule-of-three\nsum stands between the first and third, I have only to relate it in as\nfew words as may be. I shall therefore be brief.\n\n\"The room at la Grande Breteche in which Madame de Merret slept was on\nthe ground floor; a little cupboard in the wall, about four feet deep,\nserved her to hang her dresses in. Three months before the evening of\nwhich I have to relate the events, Madame de Merret had been seriously\nailing, so much so that her husband had left her to herself, and had his\nown bedroom on the first floor. By one of those accidents which it is\nimpossible to foresee, he came in that evening two hours later than\nusual from the club, where he went to read the papers and talk politics\nwith the residents in the neighborhood. His wife supposed him to have\ncome in, to be in bed and asleep. But the invasion of France had been\nthe subject of a very animated discussion; the game of billiards had\nwaxed vehement; he had lost forty francs, an enormous sum at Vendome,\nwhere everybody is thrifty, and where social habits are restrained\nwithin the bounds of a simplicity worthy of all praise, and the\nfoundation perhaps of a form of true happiness which no Parisian would\ncare for.\n\n\"For some time past Monsieur de Merret had been satisfied to ask Rosalie\nwhether his wife was in bed; on the girl's replying always in the\naffirmative, he at once went to his own room, with the good faith that\ncomes of habit and confidence. But this evening, on coming in, he took\nit into his head to go to see Madame de Merret, to tell her of his\nill-luck, and perhaps to find consolation. During dinner he had observed\nthat his wife was very becomingly dressed; he reflected as he came\nhome from the club that his wife was certainly much better, that\nconvalescence had improved her beauty, discovering it, as husbands\ndiscover everything, a little too late. Instead of calling Rosalie,\nwho was in the kitchen at the moment watching the cook and the coachman\nplaying a puzzling hand at cards, Monsieur de Merret made his way to his\nwife's room by the light of his lantern, which he set down at the lowest\nstep of the stairs. His step, easy to recognize, rang under the vaulted\npassage.\n\n\"At the instant when the gentleman turned the key to enter his wife's\nroom, he fancied he heard the door shut of the closet of which I have\nspoken; but when he went in, Madame de Merret was alone, standing in\nfront of the fireplace. The unsuspecting husband fancied that Rosalie\nwas in the cupboard; nevertheless, a doubt, ringing in his ears like a\npeal of bells, put him on his guard; he looked at his wife, and read in\nher eyes an indescribably anxious and haunted expression.\n\n\"'You are very late,' said she.--Her voice, usually so clear and sweet,\nstruck him as being slightly husky.\n\n\"Monsieur de Merret made no reply, for at this moment Rosalie came in.\nThis was like a thunder-clap. He walked up and down the room, going from\none window to another at a regular pace, his arms folded.\n\n\"'Have you had bad news, or are you ill?' his wife asked him timidly,\nwhile Rosalie helped her to undress. He made no reply.\n\n\"'You can go, Rosalie,' said Madame de Merret to her maid; 'I can put in\nmy curl-papers myself.'--She scented disaster at the mere aspect of her\nhusband's face, and wished to be alone with him. As soon as Rosalie\nwas gone, or supposed to be gone, for she lingered a few minutes in the\npassage, Monsieur de Merret came and stood facing his wife, and said\ncoldly, 'Madame, there is some one in your cupboard!' She looked at her\nhusband calmly, and replied quite simply, 'No, monsieur.'\n\n\"This 'No' wrung Monsieur de Merret's heart; he did not believe it; and\nyet his wife had never appeared purer or more saintly than she seemed\nto be at this moment. He rose to go and open the closet door. Madame de\nMerret took his hand, stopped him, looked at him sadly, and said in a\nvoice of strange emotion, 'Remember, if you should find no one there,\neverything must be at an end between you and me.'\n\n\"The extraordinary dignity of his wife's attitude filled him with deep\nesteem for her, and inspired him with one of those resolves which need\nonly a grander stage to become immortal.\n\n\"'No, Josephine,' he said, 'I will not open it. In either event we\nshould be parted for ever. Listen; I know all the purity of your soul, I\nknow you lead a saintly life, and would not commit a deadly sin to save\nyour life.'--At these words Madame de Merret looked at her husband with\na haggard stare.--'See, here is your crucifix,' he went on. 'Swear to\nme before God that there is no one in there; I will believe you--I will\nnever open that door.'\n\n\"Madame de Merret took up the crucifix and said, 'I swear it.'\n\n\"'Louder,' said her husband; 'and repeat: \"I swear before God that there\nis nobody in that closet.\"' She repeated the words without flinching.\n\n\"'That will do,' said Monsieur de Merret coldly. After a moment's\nsilence: 'You have there a fine piece of work which I never saw before,'\nsaid he, examining the crucifix of ebony and silver, very artistically\nwrought.\n\n\"'I found it at Duvivier's; last year when that troop of Spanish\nprisoners came through Vendome, he bought it of a Spanish monk.'\n\n\"'Indeed,' said Monsieur de Merret, hanging the crucifix on its nail;\nand he rang the bell.\n\n\"He had to wait for Rosalie. Monsieur de Merret went forward quickly\nto meet her, led her into the bay of the window that looked on to the\ngarden, and said to her in an undertone:\n\n\"'I know that Gorenflot wants to marry you, that poverty alone prevents\nyour setting up house, and that you told him you would not be his wife\ntill he found means to become a master mason.--Well, go and fetch him;\ntell him to come here with his trowel and tools. Contrive to wake no one\nin his house but himself. His reward will be beyond your wishes. Above\nall, go out without saying a word--or else!' and he frowned.\n\n\"Rosalie was going, and he called her back. 'Here, take my latch-key,'\nsaid he.\n\n\"'Jean!' Monsieur de Merret called in a voice of thunder down the\npassage. Jean, who was both coachman and confidential servant, left his\ncards and came.\n\n\"'Go to bed, all of you,' said his master, beckoning him to come close;\nand the gentleman added in a whisper, 'When they are all asleep--mind,\n_asleep_--you understand?--come down and tell me.'\n\n\"Monsieur de Merret, who had never lost sight of his wife while giving\nhis orders, quietly came back to her at the fireside, and began to tell\nher the details of the game of billiards and the discussion at the club.\nWhen Rosalie returned she found Monsieur and Madame de Merret conversing\namiably.\n\n\"Not long before this Monsieur de Merret had had new ceilings made to\nall the reception-rooms on the ground floor. Plaster is very scarce at\nVendome; the price is enhanced by the cost of carriage; the gentleman\nhad therefore had a considerable quantity delivered to him, knowing\nthat he could always find purchasers for what might be left. It was this\ncircumstance which suggested the plan he carried out.\n\n\"'Gorenflot is here, sir,' said Rosalie in a whisper.\n\n\"'Tell him to come in,' said her master aloud.\n\n\"Madame de Merret turned paler when she saw the mason.\n\n\"'Gorenflot,' said her husband, 'go and fetch some bricks from the\ncoach-house; bring enough to wall up the door of this cupboard; you can\nuse the plaster that is left for cement.' Then, dragging Rosalie and the\nworkman close to him--'Listen, Gorenflot,' said he, in a low voice,\n'you are to sleep here to-night; but to-morrow morning you shall have a\npassport to take you abroad to a place I will tell you of. I will give\nyou six thousand francs for your journey. You must live in that town for\nten years; if you find you do not like it, you may settle in another,\nbut it must be in the same country. Go through Paris and wait there till\nI join you. I will there give you an agreement for six thousand francs\nmore, to be paid to you on your return, provided you have carried out\nthe conditions of the bargain. For that price you are to keep perfect\nsilence as to what you have to do this night. To you, Rosalie, I will\nsecure ten thousand francs, which will not be paid to you till your\nwedding day, and on condition of your marrying Gorenflot; but, to get\nmarried, you must hold your tongue. If not, no wedding gift!'\n\n\"'Rosalie,' said Madame de Merret, 'come and brush my hair.'\n\n\"Her husband quietly walked up and down the room, keeping an eye on the\ndoor, on the mason, and on his wife, but without any insulting display\nof suspicion. Gorenflot could not help making some noise. Madame de\nMerret seized a moment when he was unloading some bricks, and when her\nhusband was at the other end of the room to say to Rosalie: 'My dear\nchild, I will give you a thousand francs a year if only you will tell\nGorenflot to leave a crack at the bottom.' Then she added aloud quite\ncoolly: 'You had better help him.'\n\n\"Monsieur and Madame de Merret were silent all the time while Gorenflot\nwas walling up the door. This silence was intentional on the husband's\npart; he did not wish to give his wife the opportunity of saying\nanything with a double meaning. On Madame de Merret's side it was pride\nor prudence. When the wall was half built up the cunning mason took\nadvantage of his master's back being turned to break one of the two\npanes in the top of the door with a blow of his pick. By this Madame de\nMerret understood that Rosalie had spoken to Gorenflot. They all three\nthen saw the face of a dark, gloomy-looking man, with black hair and\nflaming eyes.\n\n\"Before her husband turned round again the poor woman had nodded to the\nstranger, to whom the signal was meant to convey, 'Hope.'\n\n\"At four o'clock, as the day was dawning, for it was the month of\nSeptember, the work was done. The mason was placed in charge of Jean,\nand Monsieur de Merret slept in his wife's room.\n\n\"Next morning when he got up he said with apparent carelessness, 'Oh,\nby the way, I must go to the Maire for the passport.' He put on his hat,\ntook two or three steps towards the door, paused, and took the crucifix.\nHis wife was trembling with joy.\n\n\"'He will go to Duvivier's,' thought she.\n\n\"As soon as he had left, Madame de Merret rang for Rosalie, and then in\na terrible voice she cried: 'The pick! Bring the pick! and set to work.\nI saw how Gorenflot did it yesterday; we shall have time to make a gap\nand build it up again.'\n\n\"In an instant Rosalie had brought her mistress a sort of cleaver; she,\nwith a vehemence of which no words can give an idea, set to work to\ndemolish the wall. She had already got out a few bricks, when, turning\nto deal a stronger blow than before, she saw behind her Monsieur de\nMerret. She fainted away.\n\n\"'Lay madame on her bed,' said he coldly.\n\n\"Foreseeing what would certainly happen in his absence, he had laid\nthis trap for his wife; he had merely written to the Maire and sent for\nDuvivier. The jeweler arrived just as the disorder in the room had been\nrepaired.\n\n\"'Duvivier,' asked Monsieur de Merret, 'did not you buy some crucifixes\nof the Spaniards who passed through the town?'\n\n\"'No, monsieur.'\n\n\"'Very good; thank you,' said he, flashing a tiger's glare at his wife.\n'Jean,' he added, turning to his confidential valet, 'you can serve my\nmeals here in Madame de Merret's room. She is ill, and I shall not leave\nher till she recovers.'\n\n\"The cruel man remained in his wife's room for twenty days. During\nthe earlier time, when there was some little noise in the closet,\nand Josephine wanted to intercede for the dying man, he said, without\nallowing her to utter a word, 'You swore on the Cross that there was no\none there.'\"\n\n\nAfter this story all the ladies rose from table, and thus the spell\nunder which Bianchon had held them was broken.

The film was directed by Bud Pollard.\n\nThemes\nThe Black King chronicles the rise and fall of a fictionalized charismatic leader of a back-to-Africa movement, satirizing the life of Marcus Garvey. The film explores numerous critiques of Garvey's movement, including the lack of knowledge about Africa, the presumptuousness in making plans for future development and government in Africa without consultation of people already there, and conflicts between lighter skinned and darker skinned African Americans. While Garvey was a primarily a political leader with religious opinions, his counterpart in the film was primarily a preacher and religious leader. The film was intended to resonate with the audience's pre-existing disillusionment with Garvey.\n\nHistory\nThe Black King was written as a stage play by Donald Heywood and plans were publicly announced to produce it on Broadway directed by Russian choreographer L\u00e9onide Massine. This never took place. Instead, Heywood's story was adapted by Morris M. Levinson and it was produced as a film by Southland Pictures under white director Bud Pollard in 1932.

He is the god who planted the tree of life called Ulukay\u0131n. Kayra is described as both father and mother, and resides in the 17th layer of heaven.He is the supreme god of the pantheon and the son of sky deity named Tengri. This son, Kara Han (the black king or ruler of the land \u2013 Kara may mean land, earth, black or in a sense strong, powerful), left his father's home in the heaven and went to live in the underworld. On occasion, identified as Kara-Khan (black king), he was the primordial god and his father was the ancordial god called Tengri.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of this deity is found in several forms, as is that of his opponent. \"Kayra-Khan\" may be translated as \"merciful king\", while the form \"Kara Han\" signifies \"black king\". For this reason, authority on Turkic Mythology Deniz Karakurt, considers Kara-Han and Kayra-Han to be two different deities. Furthermore, the Turkish word kara can mean both black and land, with the result that Kara Han can mean not only 'Black (Dark) Ruler' but also 'Ruler of the Land'.\n\nGod of Creation\nIn ancient Turkic  belief known as Altai myth of creation, Tangri (God) Kara Han is neither male nor female nor even human in form, but a pure-white goose that flies constantly over an endless expanse of water (time), the benign creator of all that is, including the other, lesser gods. Among all Altai people the dualistic division is most clear (Ulgen and Erlik), and the highest god, Tengre Kaira Khan, is a good power. But before Ak Ana appears to urge it to create, Kara-han becomes anxious, creation occurring in a context of loneliness, turmoil and fear: the water becomes turbulent, but it reassures itself that it \"need not fear\" (the implication of such self-reassurance being that it is indeed afraid). Supreme being in the universe it created, Kara-han is the ruler of the three realms of air, water and land, seated on the seventeenth level of the universe, from which it determines the fate of its creation. After creating the universe it planted the nine-boughed tree of life, from the branches of which came the ancestors of humans. Thus emerged the nine races (nine clans).\nIt has three sons: Ulgan, Mergen and Kyzaghan.\nA Tuvinian \/ Soyoth legend, told as follows: The giant turtle which supported the earth moved, which caused the cosmic ocean to begin flooding the earth. An old man who had guessed something like this would happen, built a raft. Boarded it with his family, and he was saved. When the waters receded, the raft was left on a high wooded mountain, where, it is said, it remains today. After the flood Kaira-Khan created everything around the world. Among other things, he taught people how to make Araq (some kind of liquor).\n\nSee also\nBai-Ulgan\nTurul\nPassage 6:\nBlack King\nBlack King may refer to:\n\nThe black king (chess)\nA black king (playing card), either the King of Spades or the King of Clubs\nBlack King (comics), a number of comics characters\nBlack King, a character in Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror\nBlack King (Ultra monster), a kaiju from Return of Ultraman\nLampropeltis getula, the Black King Snake\nThe Black King (film), a 1932 race film starring A.B.

{"context":"Current address: Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.\nIn a variety of species, reduced food intake, and in particular protein or amino acid (AA) restriction, extends lifespan and healthspan. However, the underlying epigenetic and\/or transcriptional mechanisms are largely unknown, and dissection of specific pathways in cultured cells may contribute to filling this gap. We have previously shown that, in mammalian cells, deprivation of essential AAs (methionine\/cysteine or tyrosine) leads to the transcriptional reactivation of integrated silenced transgenes, including plasmid and retroviral vectors and latent HIV-1 provirus, by a process involving epigenetic chromatic remodeling and histone acetylation. Here we show that the deprivation of methionine\/cysteine also leads to the transcriptional upregulation of endogenous retroviruses, suggesting that essential AA starvation affects the expression not only of exogenous non-native DNA sequences, but also of endogenous anciently-integrated and silenced parasitic elements of the genome. Moreover, we show that the transgene reactivation response is highly conserved in different mammalian cell types, and it is reproducible with deprivation of most essential AAs. The General Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase and the downstream integrated stress response represent the best candidates mediating this process; however, by pharmacological approaches, RNA interference and genomic editing, we demonstrate that they are not implicated. Instead, the response requires MEK\/ERK and\/or JNK activity and is reproduced by ribosomal inhibitors, suggesting that it is triggered by a novel nutrient-sensing and signaling pathway, initiated by translational block at the ribosome, and independent of mTOR and GCN2. Overall, these findings point to a general transcriptional response to essential AA deprivation, which affects the expression of non-native genomic sequences, with relevant implications for the epigenetic\/transcriptional effects of AA restriction in health and disease.\nCopyright: \u00a9 2018 De Vito et al.

In particular, studies in yeast, animal models and humans have shown that reduced food intake, reducing either overall calories, or only sugars, proteins, or even single amino acids (AA), such as Methionine (Met), may extend lifespan and healthspan, and reduce the risk of cancer and other age-related diseases [3\u20139]. In addition, fasting or specific AA deprivation have shown potential therapeutic applications, owing to their ability to directly reduce the growth of some tumor types [10, 11], sensitize cancer cells to chemo- or immunotherapy [12, 13], and allow efficient hematopoietic stem cell engraftment . However, little is known about the specific processes and molecular mechanisms mediating the roles of nutrient restriction in human health and longevity.\nA properly balanced diet in metazoans contains optimal amounts of a subset of AA, which cannot be synthetized de novo and are therefore named essential amino acids (EAAs). In humans these include Met, Histidine (His), Isoleucine (Ile), Leucine (Leu), Lysine (Lys), Phenylalanine (Phe), Threonine (Thr), Tryptophan (Trp), and Valine (Val), while a few others are considered as semi-essential, such as Glutamine (Gln) and Tyrosine (Tyr) [15, 16]. Consistently, EAA deprivation triggers a cell-autonomous adaptive response, characterized by extensive metabolic and gene expression modifications, implementing biosynthetic, catabolic, and plasma membrane transport processes, aimed at reconstituting the full AA complement [17, 18]. The best known and conserved pathways responding to AA deprivation are triggered by mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) and General amino acid Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) protein kinases [15, 19, 20]. Activation of mTORC1 requires in particular the presence of Gln, Arg and Leu, but also Met , which activate the kinase through sensors mainly acting upstream of Rag GTPases at lysosomal membranes . In turn, mTORC1 promotes cell growth, proliferation and anabolism upon activation, and translational attenuation and autophagy upon inhibition [19, 20].\nBy contrast, GCN2 is activated by deprivation of any individual EAA, by means of its histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domain, which binds uncharged tRNAs accumulating during AA limitation [23, 24]. Upon activation, GCN2 phosphorylates and inhibits its only known downstream target, namely the eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 \u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), thereby initiating the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). This leads to attenuation of general translation, and induction of a transcriptional\/translational program, aimed at increasing stress resistance and restoring cell homeostasis, by upregulating a specific subset of genes, including Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) and C\/EBP-Homologous Protein (CHOP) [25\u201327]. Thus, inhibition of mTORC1 and activation of GCN2 by AA restriction cooperate to attenuate general translation at the initiation step, increase catabolism and turnover, and enhance stress resistance to promote adaptation . However, how these processes eventually induce protective mechanisms against the alterations associated with aging, which include pervasive epigenetic and transcriptional changes [28, 29], remains largely unknown.\nWe previously reported the unexpected observation that prolonged deprivation of either Tyr, or of both Methionine and Cysteine (Met\/Cys), triggers the selective and reversible reactivation of exogenous transcriptional units, including plasmids, retroviral vectors and proviruses, integrated into the genome and transcriptionally repressed by defensive mechanisms against non-native DNA sequences [30, 31]. This phenomenon was observed both in HeLa epithelial and ACH-2 lymphocytic human cells, and was independent of the transgene or provirus (Ocular Albinism type 1, OA1; Green Fluorescent Protein, GFP; Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1, LAMP1; Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1, HIV-1), or of the exogenous promoter driving their transcription, either viral (cytomegalovirus, CMV; Long Terminal Repeat, LTR) or human (Phospho-Glycerate Kinase 1, PGK1; Elongation Factor-1\u03b1, EF-1\u03b1) . Furthermore, this transgene reactivation response was not reproduced by serum starvation, activation of p38, or pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR (PP242 or rapamycin), sirtuins and DNA methylation. By contrast, it was induced by pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and by selective inhibitors of class II HDACs . Consistently, we found that the mechanism responsible involves epigenetic modifications at the transgene promoter, including reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation, and is mediated in part by reduced expression of a class II HDAC, namely HDAC4 .\nThese findings indicate that AA deprivation induces a specific epigenetic and transcriptional response, affecting the expression of newly-integrated exogenous transgenes and proviruses, and suggesting that endogenous sequences sharing similar structural and functional features may represent a transcriptional target as well [30, 31]. In particular, transposable elements, such as LTR-retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses, ERVs), are genomic \u201cparasites\u201d anciently-integrated into the genome, and silenced by epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian cells against the spreading of mobile elements, eventually becoming \"endogenized\" during evolution [32, 33]. This raises the question of whether their expression is also sensitive to AA restriction. In addition, it remains unclear whether or not the transgene reactivation response is related to specific AA deprivations, and most importantly which is the AA sensing\/signaling pathway involved, in particular whether the GCN2 kinase is implicated. Thus, here we used the reactivation of silenced transgenes in cultured cells, as a model to investigate a novel molecular pathway induced by imbalanced EAA starvation, implicated in the epigenetic\/transcriptional regulation of exogenous non-native DNA sequences and possibly of other endogenous anciently-integrated genomic elements.\nHeLa human epithelial carcinoma, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells were maintained in DMEM containing glutaMAX (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 U\/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg\/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cell lines carrying integrated and partially silenced transgenes were also maintained in 600\u20131000 \u03bcg\/ml G418.\nThe C2C12 cell line was provided by ATCC. HeLa and HepG2 cells were obtained by Drs. F. Blasi and G. Tonon at San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, respectively, and were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiling, using the Cell ID System kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, STR-based multiplex PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 \u03bcL\/reaction, including 5 \u03bcL Cell ID Enzyme Mix 5X, 2.5 \u03bcL Cell ID Primer Mix 10X and 3 ng of template DNA. The thermal cycling conditions were: 1 cycle at 96\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 32 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 62\u00b0C for 90 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 90 sec, and 1 cycle at 60\u00b0C for 45 sec. The following STR loci were amplified: AMEL, CSF1PO, D13S317, D16S539, D21S11, D5S818, D7S820, TH01, TPOX, vWA. Fragment length analysis of STR-PCR products was performed by Eurofins Genomics, using standard procedures of capillary electrophoresis on the Applied Biosystems 3130 XL sequencing machine, and assessment of the STR profile was performed at the online STR matching analysis service provided at http:\/\/www.dsmz.de\/fp\/cgi-bin\/str.html.\nStable cell clones, expressing myc-tagged human OA1 (GPR143) or GFP transcripts, were generated using pcDNA3.1\/OA1myc-His or pcDNA3.1\/EGFP vectors . Briefly, HeLa, HepG2 and C2C12 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche) and selected with 800, 1000, and 650 \u03bcg\/ml of G418 (Sigma), respectively, which was maintained thereafter to avoid loss of plasmid integration. G418-resistant clones were isolated and analyzed for protein expression by epifluorescence and\/or immunoblotting.\nFull DMEM-based medium, carrying the entire AA complement, and media deprived of Met\/Cys (both AAs), Met (only), Cys (only), Alanine (Ala), Thr, Gln, Val, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Lys and His were prepared using the Nutrition free DMEM (cat.#09077\u201305, from Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), by adding Glucose, NaHCO3, and either all 20 AAs (for full medium) or 18\u201319 AAs only (for deprivations of two-one AAs). Single AAs, Glucose, and NaHCO3 were from Sigma. Further details and amounts utilized are indicated in S1 Table. All media were supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U\/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), 100 mg\/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and G418 as required. HBSS was from Invitrogen. Cells were seeded at 10\u201330% of confluency; cells to be starved for 48 h were plated 2\u20133 times more confluent compared to the control. The following day, cells were washed and cultured in the appropriate medium, with or without EAA, for 24\u201348 h.\nL-Histidinol (HisOH), PP242, Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor (ISRIB), SP600125, Cycloheximide (CHX) were from Sigma; Salubrinal was from Tocris Bioscience; U0126 was from Promega. Drugs were used at the following final concentrations: HisOH at 4\u201316 mM; PP242 at 1\u20133 \u03bcM; ISRIB at 100 nM; SP600125 at 20 \u03bcM in HepG2 cells and 50 \u03bcM in HeLa cells; Cycloheximide (CHX) at 50 ug\/ml in HepG2 cells and 100 ug\/ml in HeLa cells; Salubrinal at 75 \u03bcM; U0126 at 50 \u03bcM. Vehicle was used as mock control. Treatments with drugs to be tested for their ability to inhibit transgene reactivation (ISRIB, SP600125 and U0126) were initiated 1h before the subsequent addition of L-Histidinol (ISRIB) or the subsequent depletion of Met\/Cys (SP600125 and U0126).\nTotal RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Equal amount (1 \u03bcg) of RNA from HeLa, HepG2 and C2C12 cells was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using oligo-dT as primers, and diluted to 5 ng\/\u03bcl. The cDNA (2 \u03bcl) was amplified by real-time PCR using SYBR green Master Mix on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The thermal cycling conditions were: 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40\u201345 cycles at 95\u00b0 for 20 sec, 56\u00b0 for 20 sec and 72\u00b0 for 20 sec. The sequences, efficiencies and annealing temperatures of the primers are provided in S2 Table. Data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel using the formula Etarget\u0394ct target (control-sample) \/Ereference\u0394ct reference (control-sample) . Reference genes for normalizations were ARPC2 (actin-related protein 2\/3 complex, subunit 2) for HeLa and HepG2 cells; and Actb (actin beta) for C2C12 cells, unless otherwise indicated.\nsiRNA (Mission esiRNA, 200 ng\/\u03bcL; Sigma) against ATF4 and GCN2 were designed against the targeted sequences NM_001675 and NM_001013703, respectively. Cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of siRNAs and 5 \u03bcL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following manufacturer\u2019s instructions, at day 1 post-plating for ATF4 and at day 1 and 2 post-plating for GCN2. At day 2 (ATF4) or 3 (GCN2) post-plating, cells were washed and cultured in medium in the absence or presence of HisOH 4 mM for 6 h. siRNAs against RLuc (Sigma), targeting Renilla Luciferase, were used as negative control. For CRISPR\/Cas9 experiments, we used the \u201call-in-one Cas9-reporter\u201d vector, expressing GFP (Sigma), which is characterized by a single vector format including the Cas9 protein expression cassette and gRNA (guide RNA). GFP is co-expressed from the same mRNA as the Cas9 protein, enabling tracking of transfection efficiency and enrichment of transfected cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The human U6 promoter drives gRNA expression, and the CMV promoter drives Cas9 and GFP expression. The oligonucleotide sequences for the three gRNAs targeting GCN2 exon 1 or 6 are listed in S2 Table. We transfected HeLa and HepG2 cells with these plasmids individually (one plasmid one guide) and sorted the GFP-positive, transfected cells by FACS. Screening GCN2-KO clones was performed by western blotting. In the case of HepG2-OA1 cells, two rounds of selection were necessary to obtain three GCN2-KO clones by using a guide RNA against exon 1. Compared to the original HepG2-OA1 cell line and to the clone resulting from the first round of selection (185#27), the selected clones E23, F22 and F27 showed a very low amount\u2014if any\u2014of residual GCN2 protein (see results).\nGenomic DNA of HeLa and HepG2 cells was purified using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). PCR conditions for amplification of GCN2 exon 1 and 6 were as follows: 1 cycle at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 40 sec, 56\u00b0C for 40 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 40 sec; and a final extension step of 5 min at 72\u00b0C. The primer sequences are provided in S2 Table.\nFor OA1, western immunoblotting was carried out as described . For GCN2, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel; immunoblotting was then performed following standard procedures. Primary Abs were as follows: anti-human OA1, previously developed by our group in rabbits ; anti-GCN2 (Cell Signaling, Cat. #3302).\nStatistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel for Mac (version 15.32, Microsoft) for Student\u2019s t-test; or GraphPad Prism (version 5.0d for Mac, GraphPad Software, Inc.) for one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett\u2019s or Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons post-tests. T-test was used when only two means, typically sample versus control, were compared, as specified in the figure legends. One way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons, followed by either a Dunnett\u2019s (to compare every mean to a control mean), or a Tukey\u2019s (to compare every mean with every other mean) post-test, by setting the significance level at 0.05 (95% confidence intervals). Both tests compare the difference between means to the amount of scatter, quantified using information from all the groups. Specifically, Prism computes the Tukey-Kramer test, allowing unequal sample sizes. P values in Figures are generally referred to comparison between a sample and the control (full medium\/mock), and are indicated as follows: *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. Comparisons not involving the control are similarly indicated, by a horizontal line at the top of the graphs, encompassing the two samples under analysis. Additional details regarding the specific experiments are reported in the Figure Legends.\nTo examine the expression behavior of genomic repeats upon AA starvation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis taking advantage of an intramural sequencing facility. HeLa-OA1 cells were cultured in normal medium (for 6-30-120 hours) or in absence of Met\/Cys (for 6-15-30-72-120 hours). Total RNA was prepared using Trizol (Sigma) to preserve transcripts of both small and long sizes (from Alu, of about 0.3 kb, to Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements, LINEs, and ERVs, up to 6\u20138 kb long), DNase treated to avoid contamination of genomic DNA, and processed for NGS sequencing by Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 protocol and HiSeq 2000 apparatus. Raw sequence data (10\u201320 M reads\/sample) were aligned to the human genome (build hg19) with SOAPSplice . Read counts over repeated regions, defined by RepeatMasker track from UCSC genome browser , were obtained using bedtools suite . Normalization factors and read dispersion (d) were estimated with edgeR , variation of abundance during time was analyzed using maSigPro package , fitting with a negative binomial distribution (\u0398 = 1\/d, Q = 0.01), with a cutoff on stepwise regression fit r2 = 0.7. Read counts were transformed to RPKM for visualization purposes. The expression of the OA1 transgene and HDAC4, which are progressively up- and down-regulated during starvation, respectively , were used as internal controls.\nFor genomic repeat analysis, reads belonging to repetitive elements were classified according to RepeatMasker and assigned to repeat classes (total number in the genome = 21), families (total number in the genome = 56) and finally subfamilies (total number in the genome = 1396), each including a variable number of genomic loci (from a few hundred for endogenous retroviruses, up to several thousand for Alu). Repeat subfamilies were then clustered according to their expression pattern in starved vs control cells, by maSigPro using default parameters, and repeats classes or families that are significantly enriched in each cluster, compared to all genomic repeats, were identified by applying a Fisher Exact test (using scipy.stats, a statistical module of Python). Alternatively, differentially expressed repeat subfamilies were identified by averaging three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. Repeats significantly up- or downregulated (104 and 77, respectively) were selected based on a P value <0.05 (unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test, assuming equal variance), and analyzed for their class enrichment by a Fisher Exact test as described above.\nFor gene set enrichment analysis of Met\/Cys deprived vs control HeLa cells, differentially expressed genes were selected considering three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls, based on a P value <0.05 (unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test, assuming equal variance) and a fold change >2. This led to a total of 2033 differentially expressed genes, 996 upregulated and 1037 downregulated. The enrichment analysis was performed separately for up and down regulated genes, or with all differentially expressed genes together (both), using the KEGG database. The analysis was performed with correction for the background of all expressed genes (about 13600 genes showing an average expression over 3 starvation and 3 control samples of at least 5 counts) and by using default parameters (adjusted P value and q-value cut-off of <0.05 and 0.2, respectively). Differentially expressed genes were also selected considering all starvation time points, as with genomic repeats, by maSigPro using default parameters, and a fold change of at least 1.5, leading to similar enrichment results (not shown). RNAseq gene expression data are available in the ArrayExpress database under the accession number E-MTAB-6452.\nTo provide proof-of-principle that AA starvation may affect the expression of transposable elements, we performed an RNAseq analysis of the previously described HeLa-OA1 cells, carrying an integrated and partially silenced OA1 transgene . Since the reactivation of the transgene by starvation is a progressive phenomenon , we performed a time-course experiment, where each time point represents one biological sample, rather than a biological triplicate of a single time point. To this aim, cells were cultured either in normal medium, or in absence of Met\/Cys for different time points (6-15-30-72-120 hours), resulting in the progressive upregulation of the OA1 transgene during starvation (Fig 1A and 1B), consistent with previously published results . The expression of genomic repeats was determined according to RepeatMasker annotation and classification into classes, families, and subfamilies. Repeat species were then subjected to differential expression and enrichment analyses in starved vs control conditions. Out of 1396 annotated repeat subfamilies, 172 species displayed a differential expression profile during starvation.\nFig 1. Exogenous transgene and endogenous retroviruses are upregulated in Met\/Cys-deprived HeLa cells.\n(A,B) Exogenous integrated transgene (OA1) mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 cells, cultured in Met\/Cys-deprived medium for the indicated time points, and analyzed by RNAseq (A), or RT-qPCR (B), compared to full medium. Data represent RPKM (A), or mean \u00b1 SD of 2 technical replicates, expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium at 6 h = 1) (B). (C) Clustering of 172 genomic repeat subfamilies, differentially expressed upon starvation, according to their expression profile. (D) Class distribution of repeat subfamilies belonging to differential expression clusters, compared to all genomic repeat subfamilies (first column). Class DNA includes DNA transposons; SINE includes Alu; LINE includes L1 an L2; LTR includes endogenous retroviruses and solitary LTRs; Satellite includes centromeric acrosomal and telomeric satellites; Others includes SVA, simple repeats, snRNA, and tRNAs. LTR-retroelements are significantly enriched among repeats that are upregulated upon starvation, while LINEs are significantly enriched among repeats that are downregulated. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001 (Fisher exact test).\nAs shown in Fig 1C, the clustering of differentially expressed repeats, according to their expression pattern, reveals profiles comparable to the behavior of the transgene in the same conditions, i.e. upregulation upon starvation and no change in regular medium (Cluster 1 and 2). In particular, Cluster 1 contains sequences that, similarly to the OA1 transgene, are progressively upregulated upon starvation (Fig 1A and 1C) , while Cluster 2 contains sequences that are upregulated at early time points. Interestingly, repeat families that are significantly enriched in these two clusters belong mostly to the group of LTR-retrotransposons, including ERV1, ERVK, ERVL, ERVL-MaLR and other LTR sequences (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). By contrast, DNA transposons (such as TcMar-Tigger) and L1 non-LTR retrotransposons are enriched among repeats that are downregulated during starvation, particularly at late time points (Clusters 3 and 4) (Fig 1D; S1A and S2A Figs). Consistent results were obtained by selecting significantly up- or downregulated genomic repeats (overall 181 species), based on their average expression out of three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h, when the transgene upregulation is more homogeneous) and controls, and on a P value <0.05 (S1B and S2B Figs). These findings suggest that EAA starvation induces genome-wide effects involving repetitive elements, and that\u2014among major repeat classes\u2014it upregulates in particular the expression of ERVs.\nIn addition, to obtain a general overview of main gene pathways changing their expression together with the transgene during AA starvation, we performed gene expression and enrichment analyses of regular genes, by considering three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls. Differentially expressed genes were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change between means of at least 2, and analyzed with the EnrichR tool . As shown in Fig 2 and S1 File, enrichment analyses against the KEGG and Reactome databases reveals a predominance of downregulated pathways, namely ribosome and translation, proteasome, AA metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and other pathways related to mitochondrial functions, which are affected in Huntington, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (http:\/\/www.genome.jp\/kegg\/pathway.html). In particular, a large fraction of ribosomal protein mRNAs is downregulated upon Met\/Cys starvation (Fig 2A and 2C; S1 File), consistent with the notion that their genes\u2013despite being scattered throughout the genome\u2014are coordinately expressed in a variety of conditions . This reduced expression may depend on multiple pathways that control ribosome biogenesis in response to external stimuli, including the downregulation of Myc activity , the downregulation of mTORC1 [42, 44], or possibly the activation of the ISR, as described in yeast . By contrast, upregulated genes show a significant enrichment for transcription and gene expression (Fig 2B). Similar results were obtained by the Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP) database (S1 File), overall indicating a general downregulation of translation and metabolism, and upregulation of transcription, during the time interval of Met\/Cys starvation corresponding to the transgene upregulation.\nFig 2. Gene set enrichment analysis of Met\/Cys-deprived HeLa cells.\nDifferentially expressed genes between three time points of starvation (15-30-72 h) and controls were selected based on a P value <0.05 and a fold change of at least 2, leading to a total of 996 upregulated, and 1037 downregulated genes. The enrichment analysis was performed separately for up and down regulated genes, using the EnrichR tool and the KEGG (A) and REACTOME (B, C) databases. Ranking is based on the combined score provided by EnrichR, and categories are displayed up to 20 items with an Adjusted P value <0.05. No significant categories were found with upregulated genes against the KEGG database. All data are shown in S1 File. The enrichment analysis using all differentially expressed genes together did not reveal any additional enriched process.\nTo characterize the pathway leading to the reactivation of silenced transgenes, we used HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, as described . In addition, to test cell types relevant for AA metabolism, such as liver and muscle, we generated clones of HepG2 human hepatoma and C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells, stably transfected with plasmids for OA1 and GFP transgenes, respectively (HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells; endogenous OA1 is not expressed in any of these cell types). In all cases, the integrated transgenes are under the control of the CMV promoter in the context of a pcDNA3.1 plasmid, are partially silenced, and can be efficiently upregulated by HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A, TSA; ref.  and S3A, S3B and S4A Figs), indicating that their expression is controlled at least in part by epigenetic mechanisms, as previously described .\nTo establish whether the reactivation response results from the shortage of specific AAs only, such as Met\/Cys, or it is triggered by any AA deprivations, we cultured HeLa-OA1, HeLa-GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells for 24\u201348 hours with a battery of media deprived of EAAs or semi-EAAs, including Met\/Cys, Thr, Gln, Val, Leu, Tyr, Trp, Lys, and His. As negative controls, cells were cultured in full medium, carrying the entire AA complement, and in a medium deprived of Ala, a non-essential AA. The expression of the transgene transcript was then evaluated by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig 3, and in S3C and S4B Figs, most EAA-deficiencies induced reactivation of the OA1 or GFP transgenes in all four cell lines, with the notable exception of Trp deprivation, which consistently resulted in no or minimal reactivation of the transgenes. Indeed, despite some variability, Met\/Cys deficiency, but also Thr, Val, Tyr, and His deprivation always gave an efficient response, while Leu, Gln and Lys elicited evident responses in some cases, but not in others. Depletion of Phe gave results comparable to Tyr deprivation, however it significantly altered multiple reference genes used for normalization and therefore was eventually omitted from the analysis (not shown). Finally, in the above experiments we used a combined Met\/Cys deficiency, to avoid the potential sparing of Met by Cys  and for consistency with our previous studies . Nevertheless, the analysis of single Met or Cys starvation, both at the protein and transcript levels, revealed an exclusive role of Met deprivation in transgene reactivation, consistent with the notion that Cys is not an EAA (S3D and S3E Fig).\nFig 3. EAA deprivation induces reactivation of silent transgenes in HeLa and HepG2 cells.\nRelative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in various AA-deprived media for 48 h and 24 h, respectively, compared to full medium. Mean \u00b1 SEM of 3 independent experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-test vs. full medium).\nCollectively, these results indicate that transgene reactivation by EAA starvation is reproducible with most EAAs, shared by different cell types (epithelium, liver, and skeletal muscle), and conserved in different mammalian species (human, mouse).\nmTORC1 inhibition and GCN2 activation trigger the best-known signaling pathways responding to AA starvation . We previously showed that inhibition of mTORC1 is not sufficient to reproduce transgene reactivation in HeLa cells . By contrast, the involvement of GCN2 and the ISR, including the downstream effectors ATF4 and CHOP, has never been tested. In addition, this pathway has been typically assessed in transient assays, lasting for a few hours, which may not be comparable with the prolonged starvation conditions necessary to reactivate the transgene expression (at least 15\u201324 h). Thus, we tested whether CHOP expression was upregulated upon incubation of HeLa-OA1, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells in media deprived of different EAAs for 24\u201348 h.\nAs shown in Fig 3 and S4B Fig, we found that CHOP expression is increased in all EAA-starvation conditions, but not in the absence of Ala, in all tested cell lines. Similar, yet less pronounced, results were obtained with ATF4, consistent with the notion that activation of this transcription factor is mainly mediated by translational upregulation (not shown) [15, 26]. However, the upregulation of CHOP does not parallel quantitatively that of the transgene, neither appears sufficient to induce it. In fact, CHOP is highly upregulated even upon Trp starvation, which consistently results in no or minimal reactivation of the transgenes (compare CHOP with OA1 or GFP expression; Fig 3 and S4B Fig). Thus, while the ISR appears widely activated upon EAA starvation, the upregulation of its downstream effector CHOP only partly correlates with transgene reactivation and may not be sufficient to induce it.\nThe activation of the ISR upon AA starvation suggests that GCN2 may be involved in the transgene reactivation response. Therefore, we tested whether direct pharmacological activation of this kinase is sufficient to trigger the transgene reactivation similarly to starvation. In addition, we used pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR to corroborate previous negative results in HeLa cells  in the other cell lines under study. To this aim, HeLa-OA1 or GFP, HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor) or L-Histidinol (GCN2 activator, inhibiting tRNAHis charging by histidyl-tRNA synthetase), either alone or in combination for 24 h, compared to Met\/Cys-deprived and full medium. As shown in Fig 4 and S5 Fig, while inhibition of mTORC1 consistently leads to minor or no effects, in agreement with previous findings , treatment with L-Histidinol results in efficient reactivation of the transgene in HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells, but not in HeLa cells.\nFig 4. mTOR inhibition and GCN2 activation differently affect transgene expression in HeLa and HepG2 cells.\nRelative transgene (OA1) and CHOP mRNA abundance in HeLa-OA1 (A) and HepG2-OA1 (B) cells, cultured in Met\/Cys-deprived medium, or in the presence of PP242 (mTOR inhibitor; 1\u20133 \u03bcM) or L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4\u201316 mM), either alone or in combination for 24\u201348 h, compared to full medium. Mean \u00b1 SEM of 4 (A) or 3 (B) independent experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-test vs. full medium). PP-1 and PP-3, PP242 at 1 and 3 \u03bcM, respectively; HisOH-4 and HisOH-16, L-Histidinol at 4 and 16 mM, respectively.\nSpecifically, L-Histidinol is not effective in HeLa-OA1 and HeLa-GFP cells, either alone or in combination with PP242 (Fig 4A and S5A Fig), or by using different concentrations of the drug, with or without serum (not shown). In these cells, L-Histidinol appears also unable to trigger the ISR, as indicated by lack of CHOP upregulation, possibly due to their different sensitivity to the drug. These findings are consistent with previous reports, describing the use of L-Histidinol in HeLa cells in conditions of low His concentration in the culture medium , which would resemble AA starvation in our system and therefore may not be applicable. Thus, even though the amount of the amino alcohol was adapted to exceed 20 to 80 times that of the amino acid, as described , HeLa cells may be resistant or able to compensate.\nIn contrast, in other cell types, L-Histidinol has been utilized in regular DMEM, to mimic the AA response triggered by DMEM lacking His [48, 49]. Consistently, in HepG2-OA1 cells, L-Histidinol is sufficient to elicit extremely high levels of transgene reactivation, and its combination with PP242 results in additive or even synergistic effects, possibly due to an indirect effect of mTOR inhibition on GCN2 activity (Fig 4B) [50, 51]. Similarly, C2C12-GFP cells efficiently reactivate the transgene upon treatment with L-Histidinol, but not PP242 (S5B Fig). However, differently from HepG2-OA1 cells, simultaneous treatment of C2C12-GFP cells with L-Histidinol and PP242 does not lead to synergistic effects. Consistent with stimulation of the ISR, CHOP and to a minor extent ATF4 are upregulated by L-Histidinol in both cell lines, yet their expression levels show only an incomplete correlation with those of the transgene (Fig 4B, S5B Fig, and not shown).\nThe finding that GCN2 activation by L-Histidinol is sufficient to reactivate the transgenes in both HepG2-OA1 and C2C12-GFP cells pointed to this kinase, and to the downstream ISR, as the pathway possibly involved in the EAA starvation response. Thus, we investigated whether the ISR is sufficient to trigger upregulation of the OA1 transgene in HepG2-OA1 cells by pharmacological means. As CHOP expression does not correspond quantitatively and is not sufficient to induce transgene reactivation, we tested the role of the core upstream event of the ISR, namely the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 , which can be induced by pharmacological treatments, independent of GCN2 (Fig 5A). To this aim, we used Salubrinal, a specific phosphatase inhibitor that blocks both constitutive and ER stress-induced phosphatase complexes against eIF2\u03b1, thereby increasing its phosphorylation . We found that, while the ISR is activated upon Salubrinal treatment, as shown by increased CHOP expression, it does not induce OA1 transgene reactivation (Fig 5B).\nFig 5. The ISR is neither sufficient nor necessary to induce transgene reactivation in HepG2 cells.\n(A) Schematic representation of GCN2 activation by AA starvation, resulting in phosphorylation of eIF2a and initiation of the downstream ISR. In addition to GCN2, the ISR may be activated by other eIF2a kinases (PKR, HRI and PERK; not shown in the picture).

Mean \u00b1 range of two experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (DMEM = 1). **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 (one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post-test; P values refer to comparisons vs. control, unless otherwise indicated). (D) Relative transgene (OA1) and ATF4 mRNA abundance in HepG2-OA1 cells transfected with control (CTRL) or anti-ATF4 siRNAs, and incubated in the presence or absence of L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4 mM) for 6 h. Mean \u00b1 range of two experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (w\/o HisOH = 1, top; control siRNA = 1, bottom). *P<0.05 (one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post-test; P values refer to comparisons vs. control, unless otherwise indicated).\nTo test whether the ISR is necessary to trigger the transgene response to L-Histidinol, we used the chemical compound ISRIB, which inhibits the activation of the ISR, even in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, likely by boosting the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2\u03b1, namely eIF2B [53, 54]. HepG2-OA1 cells were stimulated with L-Histidinol, either in the presence or absence of ISRIB. As shown in Fig 5C, while the expression of CHOP is inhibited by ISRIB, as expected, the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is not affected. In addition, knockdown of the closest eIF2\u03b1 downstream effector ATF4 by siRNAs does not interfere with the reactivation of the OA1 transgene by L-Histidinol (Fig 5D). Together, these data suggest that eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and the downstream ISR pathway are neither sufficient nor necessary to induce transgene reactivation.\nTo definitively establish if GCN2 is necessary to trigger the transgene reactivation response to EAA starvation, we directly suppressed its expression by CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated knock-out (KO). We generated three independent GCN2-KO clones from the parental HeLa-OA1 cell line, by using three different guide RNAs, two against exon 1 (clones 183#11 and 185#5), and one against exon 6 (clone 239#1) of the GCN2 gene. Genomic characterization confirmed the presence of mutations on both alleles of exon 1 of the GCN2 gene in clone 183#11, and on both alleles of exon 6 in clone 239#1; by contrast, clone 185#5 showed multiple alleles in exon 1, consistent with the presence of two cell populations, and was not characterized further at the genomic level (S6 Fig). None of these clones express GCN2 at the protein level, as shown by immunoblotting (Fig 6A). To test the GCN2-KO cells for their ability to respond to EAA starvation, parental HeLa-OA1 cells and the three GCN2-KO clones were cultured in media deprived of Met\/Cys or Thr (corresponding to the most effective treatments in this cell line; see Fig 3A) for 24\u201348 h and transgene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR. We found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, thus excluding that this kinase is necessary for the response to EAA starvation in HeLa-OA1 cells (Fig 6B and 6C).\nFig 6.

Since independent clones may display variable reactivation responses (e.g. due to different levels of transgene expression in basal conditions), the results are not shown as means of the three clones, but as separate replicates.\nSimilarly, we generated GCN2-KO clones from the parental HepG2-OA1 cell line by the same strategy. By using a guide RNA against exon 1 of the GCN2 gene, we obtained three independent GCN2-KO clones, namely E23, F22 and F27. Genomic characterization confirmed the presence of mutations on both alleles of exon 1 of the GCN2 gene in clone F27 (S7 Fig) and all three clones showed a very low amount\u2014if any\u2014of residual GCN2 protein, compared to the original HepG2-OA1 cell line (Fig 7A). To assess the ability of GCN2-KO cells to reactivate the transgene upon starvation, we cultured parental HepG2-OA1 cells and the three GCN2-KO clones in media deprived of Met\/Cys or His (corresponding to the most effective treatments in this cell line; see Fig 3B) for 24 h, and evaluated the transgene expression by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig 7B and 7C, we found that the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is neither abolished, nor reduced by KO of GCN2, as in HeLa cells. To further confirm this result, we knocked-down GCN2 by RNA interference (RNAi), and incubated the cells with or without L-Histidinol for 6 h. As shown in Fig 8, treatment of HepG2-OA1 cells with L-Histidinol results in efficient transgene reactivation, even upon significant GCN2 downregulation, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, these data strongly support the conclusion that GCN2 is not necessary for transgene reactivation in response to EAA starvation, either in HeLa or in HepG2 cells.\nFig 7.

{"context":"Passage 1:\nVeera Ballala II\nVeera Ballala II (Kannada: \u0cb5\u0cc0\u0cb0 \u0cac\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cbe\u0cb3 2) (r. 1173\u20131220 CE) was the most notable monarch of the Hoysala Empire. His successes against the Yadavas of Devagiri, the Southern Kalachuris, the Pandyas of Madurai and the waning Western Chalukya Empire, and his domination over the diminishing Cholas of Tanjore took the Hoysalas to their peak of power. The historian Chaurasia claims by the end of the 12th century, Ballala II's conquests had made the Hoysalas the most powerful dynasty of the Deccan. According to historian Derrett, Ballala II was \"the most outstanding among Hoysala kings\", and historian William Coelho in comparing Ballala II to King Vishnuvardhana writes, \"he vied in glory with his grandfather\".His court was adorned with some of the most notable of medieval Kannada language poets including the Jain poets Janna and Nemichandra, and the Brahman poet Rudrabhatta. According to the historians Chopra et al., during his rule, the Hoysala kingdom consolidated into an independent empire commencing an age of \"Hoysala imperialism\". His architectural legacy includes among numerous ornate temples, the Kedareshwara temple, the Veera Narayana temple and the Amrutesvara temple. He was ably supported in war and in administrative matters by his son, prince Vira Narasimha II, and crowned queen Umadevi. His other queen Cholamahadevi was a Chola princes. His daughter Somaladevi was given in marriage to the Chola monarch Kulothunga Chola III.\n\nWars against the neighbouring kingdoms\nBallala II's ascendancy to the Hoysala throne in c. 1173 was preceded by his successful rebellion against his weak father Narasimha I with the help of some malnad chiefs, such as the Chengalvas and the Kongalvas. He later ensured the same chiefs' could not rise against him. In the late 12th century, the weakening Chalukya throne became the bone of contention between the main vassals, the Yadavas, the Hoysalas and the Kalachuris. Around c.1168, the Kalachuri King Bijjala II had gained control of the Chalukyan capital Basavakalyan (then called Kalyani, in modern Bidar district of Karnataka state). According to historian Kamath, in c.1171, an ambitious Ballala tasted first victory against Pandya king Kavadeva of the Uchchangi family. This was followed by the annexation of Hangal in c.1178. But an attempt by him to invade Belvola-300 in c.1179 led to his defeat by Kalachuri commander Sankama who seized Hangal. According to Chopra et al., in c.1179, a Kalachuri invasion into the Hoysala territory resulted in a truce with Ballala II agreeing to accept nominal subordination and to help the Kalachuri in their designs against the Chalukyas. However, by c.1183, the Kalachuris themselves were in serious decline due to the inept rule of the sons of Bijjala II. The last Chalukya scion, Someshvara IV, was back in control of his capital Basavakalyan with help from the Kalachuri commander Brahma.\nThe real contention now, for the territories in the Krishna-Tungabhadra doab region was between the Yadava King Bhillama V and the Hoysala monarch Ballala II. By c.1189, Basavakalyana had fallen to Bhillama V who nevertheless failed to gain recognition from Chalukya vassals such as the Rattas, the Kadambas of Banavasi and the Shilahara. Taking advantage of this uncertainty, Ballala II led several expeditions to Banavasi against the exiled Chalukya King Someshvara VI and defeated him by c.1190. In c.1191, the Hoysala monarch gained the upper hand over Yadava Bhillama V in the critical battles of Soratur and Lakkundi (in the modern Gadag district) where he appears to have spent much time consolidating his gains. Thus, Ballala II was able to push the northern boundaries of the Hoysala empire up to the Malaprabha river and Krishna rivers. By c.1192, Ballala II had crowned himself the emperor over the entire modern Karnataka region. A record of his dated c.1196 claims him victorious over several minor ruling families including those of Banavasi, Hangal, Halashi, Nolambavadi (Nolamba dynasty), Bagalkot, and Gulbarga (Yelburgi) indicating he had complete control over the rich Tungabhadra-Krishna river region. After c.1212, he lost all these territories north of the Tungabhadra river to Yadava king Singhana II.\n\nRelationship with Cholas\nAround c.1216, Maravarman Sundara Pandya ascended the throne at Madurai. To seek revenge for the humiliation of his elder brother Jatavarman Kulashekara by the Chola monarch Kulothunga III, he invaded the Chola territory and drove Kulothunga into exile. Kulothunga III sought the help of the Hoysalas. Ballala II promptly sent his forces under the command of prince Narasimha II who succeeded in repulsing the Pandya and re-establishing the Chola kingdom. With this victory, Ballala II not only assumed imperial titles such as Cholarajyapratishtacharya (\"Establisher of the Chola kingdom\"), Hoysala Chakravarti (\"Hoysala emperor\") and Dakshina Chakravarti (\"Emperor of the south\"), he also brought under his direct control parts of the rich Kaveri plains around Srirangam (central Tamil Nadu). A Hoysala army was left standing in Kanchi to pursue hostilities with the Telugu Chodas and their overlords, the Kakatiya dynasty. In words of historian John Keay, \"Gloriously if briefly the Hoysalas were paramount throughout most of the Kannada speaking Deccan, and could pose a arbiters in the lusher lands below the Eastern Ghats\".\n\nPatron of art and architecture\nVeera Ballala II was a great patron of Kannada literature. Janna, one of the most influential Kannada poets of the 13th century, graced his court and was honored with the title Kavichakravarthi (\"Emperor among poets\"). His most noteworthy writing and magnum opus, the Yashodhara Charitre (c.1209) deals with Jain tenets. Nemichandra was court poet to both Ballala II and the Shilahara King Lakshmana of Kholapur. He wrote Lilavati Prabandha (about c.1170), the earliest available romantic true fiction in Kannada, and an unfinished Jain epic called Neminathapurana at the instance of Ballala II's minister. Rudrabhatta, a noteworthy Brahman writer of the late 12th century was patronized by the king and one of his ministers. He composed the Jagannatha Vijaya in c.1180, the earliest available Vaishnava epic in the Kannada language.Ballala II's rule saw the proliferation of the temple construction adhering to the Vesara architecture, a style first made popular by the Western Chalukyas. Some of the best known temples built during his rule were the Kedareshwara temple at Halebidu, the Veera Narayana temple at Belavadi, the Amrutesvara Temple at Amruthapura and the twin ensemble of the Chennakeshava and Nageshvara temples at Mosale.Ballala II donated Meruhalli village and other lands in 1174 CE for providing food to Jain monks. He further gifted two villages to Vajranandi-Siddhantadeva for the same purpose. Nanjedevaragudda stone inscription of 1192 CE describes the donations by Hoysala rulers and subjects for Jain monks at Abhinava Shantideva temple at Somepur, Hassan district.\nPassage 2:\nGeorge VI\nGeorge VI (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 \u2013 6 February 1952) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death on 6 February 1952. He was also the last Emperor of India from 1936 until the British Raj was dissolved in August 1947, and the first Head of the Commonwealth following the London Declaration of 1949.\nThe future George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother Victoria; he was named Albert at birth after his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort, and was known as \"Bertie\" to his family and close friends. His father ascended the throne as George V in 1910. As the second son of the king, Albert was not expected to inherit the throne. He spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Prince Edward, the heir apparent. Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stutter, which he learned to manage to some degree. His elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936, but Edward abdicated later that year to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. As heir presumptive to Edward VIII, Albert thereby became the third monarch of the House of Windsor, taking the regnal name George VI.\nIn September 1939, the British Empire and most Commonwealth countries\u2014but not Ireland\u2014declared war on Nazi Germany. War with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George VI was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. Britain and its allies were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had largely broken away, followed by the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died at Sandringham House, aged 56, of a coronary thrombosis in 1952. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II.\n\nEarly life\nAlbert was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), was the eldest child and only daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \"rather distressed\". Two days later, he wrote again: \"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her.\"The Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good.\" Consequently, he was baptised \"Albert Frederick Arthur George\" at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham on 17 February 1896. Formally he was His Highness Prince Albert of York; within the royal family he was known informally as \"Bertie\". The Duchess of Teck did not like the first name her grandson had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name \"may supplant the less favoured one\". Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, Edward.\nAlbert was ill often and was described as \"easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears\". His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a stutter that lasted for many years. Although naturally left-handed, he was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time. He had chronic stomach problems as well as knock knees, for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.\n\nMilitary career and education\nBeginning in 1909, Albert attended the Royal Naval College, Osborne, as a naval cadet. In 1911 he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. When his grandfather Edward VII died in 1910, his father became King George V. Prince Edward became Prince of Wales, with Albert second in line to the throne.Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship HMS Cumberland in the West Indies and on the east coast of Canada. He was rated as a midshipman aboard HMS Collingwood on 15 September 1913. He spent three months in the Mediterranean, but never overcame his seasickness. Three weeks after the outbreak of World War I he was medically evacuated from the ship to Aberdeen, where his appendix was removed by Sir John Marnoch. He was mentioned in dispatches for his actions as a turret officer aboard Collingwood in the Battle of Jutland (31 May \u2013 1 June 1916), the great naval battle of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a duodenal ulcer, for which he had an operation in November 1917.In February 1918 Albert was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the Royal Naval Air Service's training establishment at Cranwell. With the establishment of the Royal Air Force Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force. He served as Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918, before reporting for duty on the staff of the RAF's Cadet Brigade at St Leonards-on-Sea and then at Shorncliffe. He completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing. He was the first member of the British royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.Albert wanted to serve on the Continent while the war was still in progress and welcomed a posting to General Trenchard's staff in France. On 23 October, he flew across the Channel to Autigny. For the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's Independent Air Force at its headquarters in Nancy, France. Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as an RAF staff officer until posted back to Britain. He accompanied King Albert I of Belgium on his triumphal re-entry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and was promoted to squadron leader the following day.In October 1919, Albert went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied history, economics and civics for a year, with the historian R. V. Laurence as his \"official mentor\". On 4 June 1920 his father created him Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney. He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the \"Industrial Prince\". His stutter, and his embarrassment over it, together with a tendency to shyness, caused him to appear less confident in public than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at Wimbledon in the Men's Doubles with Louis Greig in 1926, losing in the first round. He developed an interest in working conditions, and was president of the Industrial Welfare Society. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.\n\nMarriage\nIn a time when royalty were expected to marry fellow royalty, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite Lady Loughborough came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her. That year, he met for the first time since childhood Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore. He became determined to marry her. Elizabeth rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family. In the words of Lady Strathmore, Albert would be \"made or marred\" by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.Albert and Elizabeth were married on 26 April 1923 in Westminster Abbey. Albert's marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture. The newly formed British Broadcasting Company wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey Chapter vetoed the idea (although the Dean, Herbert Edward Ryle, was in favour).\n\nFrom December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured Kenya, Uganda, and the Sudan, travelling via the Suez Canal and Aden. During the trip, they both went big-game hunting.Because of his stutter, Albert dreaded public speaking. After his closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, Albert opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire with the Duchess in 1927. Their journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took them via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.The Duke and Duchess had two children: Elizabeth (called \"Lilibet\" by the family, and the future Elizabeth II) who was born in 1926, and Margaret who was born in 1930. The close family lived at White Lodge, Richmond Park, and then at 145 Piccadilly, rather than one of the royal palaces. In 1931, the Canadian prime minister, R. B. Bennett, considered Albert for Governor General of Canada\u2014a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, J. H. Thomas.\n\nReign\nReluctant king\nKing George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying \"After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months\" and \"I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.\" On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. In the Vigil of the Princes, Prince Albert and his three brothers (the new king, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Prince George, Duke of Kent) took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it lay in state, in a closed casket, in Westminster Hall.\nAs Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the heir presumptive to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward abdicated in order to marry Wallis Simpson, who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British prime minister Stanley Baldwin that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. He abdicated and Albert, though he had been reluctant to accept the throne, became king. The day before the abdication, Albert went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, \"When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child.\"On the day of Edward's abdication, the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Irish Free State, removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.Across Britain, gossip spread that Albert was physically and psychologically incapable of being king. No evidence has been found to support the contemporaneous rumour that the government considered bypassing him, his children and his brother Prince Henry, in favour of their younger brother Prince George, Duke of Kent. This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son.\n\nEarly reign\nAlbert assumed the regnal name \"George VI\" to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy. The beginning of George VI's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as \"His Royal Highness Prince Edward\" for the abdication broadcast, but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession, Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including \"Royal Highness\". In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title \"Duke of Windsor\" with the style \"Royal Highness\", but the letters patent creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, as these were private properties and did not pass to him automatically. Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new queen consort, with the Order of the Garter.\n\nGeorge VI's coronation at Westminster Abbey took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, his mother Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son. There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the Government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support British prime minister Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler. When the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family. While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian John Grigg to describe George's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as \"the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century\".\n\nIn May and June 1939, the King and Queen toured Canada and the United States; it was the first visit of a reigning British monarch to North America, although George had been to Canada prior to his accession. From Ottawa, George and Elizabeth were accompanied by Canadian prime minister Mackenzie King, to present themselves in North America as King and Queen of Canada. Both Mackenzie King and the Canadian governor general, Lord Tweedsmuir, hoped that George's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the Statute of Westminster 1931, which gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions. On 19 May, George personally accepted and approved the Letter of Credence of the new U.S. ambassador to Canada, Daniel Calhoun Roper; gave royal assent to nine parliamentary bills; and ratified two   international treaties with the Great Seal of Canada. The official royal tour historian, Gustave Lanctot, wrote \"the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality\" and George gave a speech emphasising \"the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth\".The trip was intended to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public. The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor was dispelled. They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York. A strong bond of friendship was forged between Roosevelt and the royal couple during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.\n\nSecond World War\nFollowing the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the United Kingdom and the self-governing Dominions other than Ireland declared war on Nazi Germany. The King and Queen resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The first night of the Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the couple narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, Elizabeth declared: \"I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face.\" The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country. They were subject to British rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In August 1942, the King's brother, the Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.\n\nIn 1940, Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, though personally George would have preferred to appoint Lord Halifax. After the King's initial dismay over Churchill's appointment of Lord Beaverbrook to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed \"the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister\". Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940, the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness. George related much of what the two discussed in his diary, which is the only extant first-hand account of these conversations.Throughout the war, George and Elizabeth provided morale-boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. George visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and Malta in June 1943, Normandy in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944. Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance. At a social function in 1944, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Alan Brooke, revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, he thought Montgomery was after his job. George replied: \"You should worry, when I meet him, I always think he's after mine!\"In 1945, crowds shouted \"We want the King!\" in front of Buckingham Palace during the Victory in Europe Day celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain's appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with the royal family on the balcony to public acclaim. In January 1946, George addressed the United Nations at its first assembly, which was held in London, and reaffirmed \"our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small\".\n\nEmpire to Commonwealth\nGeorge VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the British Empire. The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the Commonwealth, gathered pace after the Second World War. During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent Dominions of India and Pakistan in August 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India, and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In late April 1949, the Commonwealth leaders issued the London Declaration, which laid the foundation of the modern Commonwealth and recognised George as Head of the Commonwealth. In January 1950, he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic. He remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as Burma in January 1948, Palestine (divided between Israel and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.In 1947, George and his family toured southern Africa. The prime minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Smuts, was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit. George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites, and referred to his South African bodyguards as \"the Gestapo\". Despite the tour, Smuts lost the election the following year, and the new government instituted a strict policy of racial segregation.\n\nIllness and death\nThe stress of the war had taken its toll on George's health, made worse by his heavy smoking, and subsequent development of lung cancer among other ailments, including arteriosclerosis and Buerger's disease. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after George developed an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right lumbar sympathectomy in March 1949. His elder daughter and heir presumptive, Elizabeth, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Princess Elizabeth and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, taking the place of the King and Queen.\nGeorge was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 4 June it was announced that he would need immediate and complete rest for the next four weeks, despite the arrival of Haakon VII of Norway the following afternoon for an official visit. On 23 September 1951, he underwent a surgical operation where his entire left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found. In October 1951, Elizabeth and Philip went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to George's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds, read the King's speech from the throne. The King's Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, George went to London Airport to see Elizabeth and Philip off on their tour to Australia via Kenya. It was his last public appearance. Six days later, at 07:30 GMT on the morning of 6 February, he was found dead in bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk. He had died in the night from a coronary thrombosis at the age of 56. His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.From 9 February George's coffin rested in St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, before lying in state at Westminster Hall from 11 February. His funeral took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on the 15th. He was interred initially in the Royal Vault until he was transferred to the King George VI Memorial Chapel inside St George's on 26 March 1969. In 2002, fifty years after his death, the remains of his widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and the ashes of his younger daughter, Princess Margaret, who both died that year, were interred in the chapel alongside him. In 2022, the remains of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, were also interred in the chapel.\n\nLegacy\nIn the words of Labour Member of Parliament (MP) George Hardie, the abdication crisis of 1936 did \"more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda\". George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed \"a rocking throne\" and tried \"to make it steady again\". He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign, his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded. However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.The George Cross and the George Medal were founded at the King's suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery. He bestowed the George Cross on the entire \"island fortress of Malta\" in 1943. He was posthumously awarded the Order of Liberation by the French government in 1960, one of only two people (the other being Churchill in 1958) to be awarded the medal after 1946.Colin Firth won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as George VI in the 2010 film The King's Speech.\n\nTitles, honours and arms\nAs Duke of York, Albert bore the royal arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing an anchor azure\u2014a difference earlier awarded to his father, George V, when he was Duke of York, and then later awarded to his grandson Prince Andrew, Duke of York. As king, he bore the royal arms undifferenced.\n\nIssue\nAncestry\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nThe King's Speech\nThe King's Speech is a 2010 historical drama film directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler. Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian speech and language therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast upon Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.\nSeidler read about George VI's life after learning to manage a stuttering condition he developed during his own youth. He started writing about the relationship between the therapist and his royal patient as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King's widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, the filmmakers learned of the existence of notes written by Logue that were being used by his grandson Mark and Peter Conradi as the basis of a book, and were granted permission to incorporate material from the notes and book into the script.\nPrincipal photography took place in London and around Britain from November 2009 to January 2010. Hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider-than-normal lenses were employed to recreate the Duke of York's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre framing of characters.\nThe King's Speech was a major box office and critical success. It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, screenplay, directing, score, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance, which resulted in his first Academy Award for Best Actor. At the 83rd Academy Awards, The King's Speech received 12 Oscar nominations, more than any other film in that year, and subsequently won four, including Best Picture. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of \u00a38 million, it earned over \u00a3250 million internationally.\n\nPlot\nAt the official closing of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, Prince Albert, Duke of York, the second son of King George V, addresses the crowd with a strong stammer. His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife, Elizabeth, persuades him to see the Australian-born Lionel Logue, a non-medically trained Harley Street speech defects therapist. \"Bertie\", as he is called by his family, believes the first session is not going well, but Lionel, who insists that all his patients address him as such, has his potential client recite Hamlet's \"To be, or not to be\" soliloquy while hearing classical music played on a pair of headphones. Bertie is frustrated at the experiment but Lionel gives him the acetate recording that he has made of the reading as a souvenir.\nAfter Bertie's father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 Royal Christmas Message, he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Bertie's brother's neglect of his responsibilities make training in it necessary. The attempt at reading the message himself is a failure, but that night Bertie plays the recording Lionel gave him and is astonished at the lack of stutter there. He therefore returns for daily treatments to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his speaking difficulty.\nGeorge V dies in 1936, and his eldest son David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII. A constitutional crisis arises with the new king over a prospective marriage with the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. Edward, as the supreme governor of the Church of England, cannot marry her, even if she receives her second divorce, since both her previous husbands are alive.\nAt an unscheduled session, Bertie expresses his frustration that, while his speech has improved when speaking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David, at the same time revealing the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie himself could make a good king, Bertie accuses Lionel of speaking treason and quits Lionel in anger. Bertie must now face the Accession Council without any assistance.\nBertie and Lionel only come together again after King Edward decides to abdicate in order to marry. Bertie, urged ahead by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, ascends the throne as King George VI and visits Lionel's home with his wife before their coronation, much to the surprise of Mrs. Logue when she comes upon Queen Elizabeth having tea at her dining room table. This is the first time that she learns who her husband's patient has been.\nBertie and Lionel's relationship is questioned by the King's advisors during the preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. The archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, brings to light that George never asked for advice from his advisors about his treatment and that Lionel has never had formal training.  Lionel explains to an outraged Bertie that at the time he started with speech defects there were no formal qualifications and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shell-shocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience. Bertie remains unconvinced until provoked to protest at Lionel's disrespect for King Edward's Chair and the Stone of Scone. Only at this pivotal moment, after realising he has just expressed himself without impairment, is Bertie able to rehearse with Lionel and complete the ceremony.\nAs the new king, Bertie is in a crisis when he must broadcast to Britain and the Empire following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany in 1939. Lionel is summoned to Buckingham Palace to prepare the king for his speech. Knowing the challenge that lies before him, Lang, Winston Churchill, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain are present to offer support. The King and Logue are then left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, but by the end he is speaking freely. Preparing to leave the room for the congratulations of those present, Logue mentions to the King that he still has difficulty enunciating w and the King jokes back, \"I had to throw in a few so they'd know it was me.\"\nAs the Royal Family step onto the palace balcony and are applauded by the crowd, a title card explains that Logue, who received the Royal Victorian Order for service to the Crown, was always present at King George VI's speeches during the war and that they remained friends until the King's death from lung cancer in 1952.\n\nCast\nColin Firth as King George VI\nGeoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue\nHelena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth\nGuy Pearce as King Edward VIII\nTimothy Spall as Winston Churchill\nDerek Jacobi as Cosmo Gordon Lang\nJennifer Ehle as Myrtle Logue\nMichael Gambon as King George V\nFreya Wilson as Princess Elizabeth\nRamona Marquez as Princess Margaret\nPatrick Ryecart as Lord Wigram\nSimon Chandler as Lord Dawson of Penn\nClaire Bloom as Queen Mary\nOrlando Wells as Prince George, Duke of Kent\nTim Downie as Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester\nEve Best as Wallis Simpson\nAnthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin\nAndrew Havill as Robert Wood\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nAs a child, David Seidler developed a stammer, which he believes was caused by the emotional trauma of World War II and the murder of his grandparents during the Holocaust. King George VI's success in overcoming his stammer inspired the young Seidler, \"Here was a stutterer who was a king and had to give radio speeches where everyone was listening to every syllable he uttered, and yet did so with passion and intensity.\" When Seidler became an adult, he resolved to write about King George VI. During the late 1970s and 1980s he voraciously researched the King, but found a dearth of information on Logue. Eventually Seidler contacted Valentine Logue, who agreed to discuss his father and make his notebooks available if the Queen Mother gave her permission. She asked him not to do so in her lifetime, and Seidler halted the project.\n\nThe Queen Mother died in 2002. Three years later, Seidler returned to the story during a bout of creative work inspired by a recovery from cancer. His research, including a chance encounter with an uncle whom Logue had treated, indicated he used mechanical breathing exercises combined with psychological counselling to probe the underlying causes of the condition. Thus prepared, Seidler imagined the sessions. He showed the finished screenplay to his wife, who liked it, but pronounced it too \"seduced by cinematic technique\". She suggested he rewrite it as a stage play to focus on the essential relationship between the King and Logue. After he had completed it, he sent it to a few friends who worked in theatre in London and New York for feedback.In 2005, Joan Lane of Wilde Thyme, a production company in London, received the script. Lane started talking with Simon Egan and Gareth Unwin of Bedlam Productions, and they invited Seidler to London to rewrite the play again, this time for the screen. Together, Lane and Bedlam Productions organised a reading of the play in Pleasance Theatre, a small house in north London, to a group of Australian expatriates, among whom was Tom Hooper's mother. She called her son and said, \"I've found your next project\".Instead of trying to contact his agent, Lane asked an Australian staff member to hand-deliver the script to Geoffrey Rush's house, not far away from hers in Melbourne. Unwin reports that he received a four-page e-mail from Rush's manager admonishing them for the breach of etiquette, but ending with an invitation to discuss the project further. Iain Canning from See-Saw Films became involved and, in Gareth Unwin's words: \"We worked with ex-chair of BAFTA Richard Price, and started turning this story about two grumpy men sitting in a room into something bigger.\" Hooper liked the story, but thought that the original ending needed to be changed to reflect events more closely: \"Originally, it had a Hollywood ending ... If you hear the real speech, he's clearly coping with his stammer. But it's not a perfect performance. He's managing it.\"\n\nThe production team learned \u2013 some nine weeks prior to the start of filming \u2013 of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke, which was in the process of being turned into a non-fiction book by Logue's grandson Mark and journalist Peter Conradi, titled The King's Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy. Striking an agreement with the authors, they then went back and re-worked the script to reflect what was in the notes and the book. Some lines, such as at the climax, when Logue smiles and says, \"You still stammered on the W\" to the King, who replies, \"I had to throw in a few so they would know it was me\" were direct quotations from Logue's notes. Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery.Seidler thought Paul Bettany would be a good choice to play King George VI, while Hooper preferred Hugh Grant, though both actors declined the offer. Once they met with Firth and heard him read for the part, Seidler and Hooper were convinced of his suitability for the role.The UK Film Council awarded the production \u00a31 million in June 2009. Filming began in December 2009, and lasted 39 days. Most was shot in the three weeks before Christmas because Rush would be performing in a play in January. The schedule was further complicated by Bonham Carter's availability: she worked on Harry Potter during the week, so her scenes had to be filmed during the weekend.\n\nLocation and design\nThe film depicted both regal opulence and scruffy, depression-era London. On 25 November 2009 the crew took over the Pullens buildings in Southwark and gave it the appearance of a street from 1930s London. Large advertisements for (among other things) Bovril and fascism were added to walls, and grit and grime to streets and buildings. To reproduce London smog of the time \u2013 thick enough that cars might need guidance from someone walking ahead \u2013 so much artificial smoke was used that fire alarms were triggered.On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism. Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.Lancaster House, an opulent government-owned period house in London, was rented (at \u00a320,000 per day) for interior scenes of Buckingham Palace. The 1936 Accession Council at St. James's Palace, where George VI swore an oath, was filmed in the Livery Hall of Drapers' Hall. The room, ornate and vast, met the occasion: the daunting nature of the new King's responsibilities was shown by surrounding him with rich detail, flags and royal portraiture.The crew investigated Logue's former consultation rooms, but they were too small to film in. Instead, they found a high, vaulted room not far away in 33 Portland Place. Eve Stewart, the production designer, liked the mottled, peeling wallpaper there so much that she recreated the effect throughout the entire room. In his DVD commentary, Hooper said he liked Portland Place as a set because it felt \"lived in\", unlike other period houses in London. The scenes of the Duke of York at home with his family were also filmed here; showing the Prince living in a townhouse \"subverted\" expectations of a royal drama.\n\nThe opening scene, set at the closing ceremony of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, was filmed on location at Elland Road, home of Leeds United, and Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford RLFC. Elland Road was used for the speech elements of the prince stammering his way through his first public address, and Odsal Stadium was selected because of the resemblance of its curved ends to Wembley Stadium in 1925. The crew had access to the stadium only at 10 pm, after a football game. They filled the terraces with inflatable dummies and over 250 extras dressed in period costumes. Live actors were interspersed to give the impression of a crowd. Additional people, as well as more ranks of soldiers on the pitch, were added in post-production with visual effects.Other locations include Cumberland Lodge, Harley Street, Knebworth, Hatfield House, the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Queen Street Mill Textile Museum in Burnley, and Battersea Power Station, which doubled as a BBC wireless control room. The final cut of the film was completed on 31 August 2010.\n\nDialogue\nIn developing his portrayal of George VI's stammer, Firth worked with Neil Swain, the voice coach for the film. His sister, Kate Firth, also a professional voice coach to actors, proposed exercises the King might have done with Logue, and made suggestions on how to imagine Logue's mix of physical and psychological coaching for the film.In addition, Firth watched archive footage of the King speaking. In an interview with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: \"[It] was very interesting while we were working on the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [Hooper] \u2013 and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [Firth] \u2013 might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did.\" In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: \"You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it's quite infectious. You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it's an insight into what it feels like.\"\n\nMusic\nThe film's original music is composed by Alexandre Desplat, which consisted of a sparse arrangement of strings and piano. The London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Terry Davies, limited orchestral score by only adding oboe and harp in one cut, to convey the character of the king, while also using single note to represent the stickiness of the King's speech. Old microphones extracted from the EMI archives, specially made for the royal family, had been used to record the score, to create a dated sound.The use of the 2nd movement (Allegretto) of Beethoven's 7th Symphony, played during the broadcast of the 1939 radio speech from the film's climax, was played as a temp track added by editor Tariq Anwar. Desplat did not want to change the track and defended Anwar's suggestion, as the theme has a universal quality. Hooper further remarked that the stature of the piece helps elevate the status of the speech to a public event. The score album also featured Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Marriage of Figaro overture. The score was nominated for several awards, including Best Original Score at the Oscars, Golden Globes, and BAFTAs, winning the latter award. The score also won a Grammy at the 54th Grammy Awards.\n\nVisual style\nHooper employed a number of cinematic techniques to evoke the King's feelings of constriction. He and cinematographer Danny Cohen used wider than normal lenses to photograph the film, typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm, where the subtle distortion of the picture helps to convey the King's discomfort. For instance, the subjective point of view shot during the Empire exhibition speech used a close up of the microphone with a wider lens, similar to the filming technique used for one of the Duke's early consultations with a physician. In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the feeling of entrapment inside the King's head was rendered overly literal with what she believed to be a fisheye lens, though in these scenes the wider lenses were used. Hooper also discussed using the 18mm lens, one he likes \"because it puts human beings in their context\".Roger Ebert noted that the majority of the film was shot indoors, where oblong sets, corridors, and small spaces manifest constriction and tightness, in contrast to the usual emphasis on sweep and majesty in historical dramas. Hooper used wide shots to capture the actors' body language, particularly that of Geoffrey Rush, who trained at L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq in Paris and \"is consequently brilliant in the way he carries his body\". Hooper widened his scope first to capture Rush's gestures, then full body movements and silhouettes. The approach carried over to Firth as well. In the first consultation scene, the Duke is squeezed against the end of a long couch framed against a large wall, \"as if to use the arm of the sofa as a kind of friend, as a security blanket?\" Martin Filler praised the \"low-wattage\" cinematography of Danny Cohen's, as making everything look like it has been \"steeped in strong tea\".At other times, the camera was positioned very close to the actors to catch the emotion in their faces: \"If you put a lens 6 inches from somebody's face, you get more emotion than if you're on a long lens 20 feet away,\" Cohen said in an interview. Hooper sought a second subtlety while filming the first consultation room scene between the two men, having placed the camera 18 inches from Colin Firth's face: \"I wanted the nervousness of the first day to percolate into his performances,\" he said.Historical dramas traditionally tend to use \"soft light\", but Hooper wanted to use a harsher glare, which gives a more contemporary feel, and thus a greater emotional resonance. To achieve the effect, the lighting team erected huge blackout tents over the Georgian buildings and used large lights filtered through Egyptian cotton.\n\nHistorical accuracy\nSeveral events in the film did not happen, or were exaggerated. The visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 74.4% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarising: \"Some nips and tucks of the historical record, but mostly an accurate retelling of a unique friendship\".\n\nRelationship with Lionel Logue\nThe filmmakers not only tightened the chronology of the events to just a few years but even shifted the timeline of treatment. The Duke of York actually began working with Logue in October 1926, ten years before the abdication crisis, and the improvement in his speech was apparent in months rather than years as suggested by the film. When he was dispatched to Australia to open their new Parliament House in Canberra in 1927, the Duke gave numerous speeches during the journey and performed well despite Logue not accompanying him on the trip. He wrote to Logue from the Caribbean, \"You remember my fear of 'The King'. I give it every evening at dinner on board. This does not worry me any more.\" Of his speech opening Parliament it was observed that he spoke \"resonantly and without stuttering\".Robert Logue, a grandson of Lionel, doubted the film's depiction of the speech therapist, stating \"I don't think he ever swore in front of the King and he certainly never called him 'Bertie'\". Andrew Roberts, an English historian, states that the severity of the King's stammer was exaggerated and the characters of Edward VIII, Wallis Simpson, and George V made more antagonistic than they really were, to increase the dramatic effect.\n\nPolitics\nChristopher Hitchens and Isaac Chotiner have criticised the film for failing to indict the appeasement of the era or to portray Edward VIII's sympathetic attitude to Nazi Germany.  The Guardian also corrected the portrayal of Stanley Baldwin as having resigned due to his refusal to order Britain's re-armament, when he in fact stepped down as \"a national hero, exhausted by more than a decade at the top\". Stanley's grandson, Earl Baldwin, was particularly unhappy with this film due to its factual distortions and portrayal of his grandfather as a dithering fool who misunderstood Hitler's intentions.Hugo Vickers, an adviser on the film, agreed that the alteration of historical details to preserve the essence of the dramatic story was sometimes necessary. The high-ranking officials, for instance, would not have been present when the King made his speech, nor would Churchill have been involved at any level, \"but the average viewer knows who Churchill is; he doesn't know who Lord Halifax and Sir Samuel Hoare are.\"Hitchens and Chotiner also challenged the film's portrayal of Winston Churchill's role in the abdication crisis. It is well established that Churchill encouraged Edward VIII to resist pressure to abdicate, whereas he is portrayed in the film as supportive of the Duke of York and not opposed to the abdication. Hitchens attributes this treatment to the \"cult\" surrounding Churchill's legacy. In a smart, well-made film \"would the true story not have been fractionally more interesting for the audience?\", he wondered.\n\nRealism\nMartin Filler acknowledged that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, such as in the probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis.Commenting on the film's final scene on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, Andrew Roberts has written, \"The scene is fairly absurd from a historical point of view \u2013 Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill were not present and there were no cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace.\" However, Roberts praises the film overall as a sympathetic portrayal of the King's \"quiet, unassuming heroism [...] The portrayals by Firth and Bonham Carter are sympathetic and acute, and the movie's occasional factual b\u00eatises should not detract from that.\"\n\nRelease\nCinema release\nThe film had its world premi\u00e8re on 6 September 2010 at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States. It was screened at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, on Firth's 50th birthday, where it received a standing ovation and won the People's Choice Award. The cinema release poster was re-designed to show an extreme close-up of Firth's jaw and a microphone after Hooper criticised the first design as a \"train smash\". Tim Appelo called the original, air-brushed effort, which showed the three leads, \"shockingly awful\" though the new one \"really is worthwhile\".The film was distributed by Transmission Films in Australia and by Momentum Pictures in the United Kingdom. The Weinstein Company distributed it in North America, Germany, Benelux, Scandinavia, China, Hong Kong, and Latin America. The film was released in France on 2 February 2011 by Wild Bunch under the title Le discours d'un roi.\n\nRatings controversy\nThe film was initially given a 15 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification, due to a minute-long scene where Logue encourages the King to swear, which he could do without stuttering. At the London Film Festival, Hooper criticised the decision, questioning how the board could certify the film \"15\" for bad language but allow films such as Salt (2010) and Casino Royale (2006) to have \"12A\" ratings, despite their graphic torture scenes. Following Hooper's criticism, the board lowered the rating to \"12A\", allowing children under 12 years of age to see the film if they are accompanied by an adult. Hooper levelled the same criticism at the Motion Picture Association of America, which gave the film an \"R\" rating, preventing anyone under the age of 17 from seeing the film without an adult. In his review, Roger Ebert criticised the \"R\" rating, calling it \"utterly inexplicable\", and wrote, \"This is an excellent film for teenagers.\"In January 2011 Harvey Weinstein, the executive producer and distributor, said he was considering having the film re-edited to remove some profanity, so that it would receive a lower classification and reach a larger audience. Hooper refused to cut the film, though he considered covering the swear words with bleeps. Helena Bonham Carter also defended the film, saying, \"[The film] is not violent. It's full of humanity and wit. [It's] for people not with just a speech impairment, but who have got confidence [doubts].\" After receiving his Academy Award, Colin Firth noted that he does not support re-editing the film; while he does not condone the use of profanity, he maintains that its use was not offensive in this context. \"The scene serves a purpose\", Firth states. An alternative version, with some of the profanities muted out, was classified as \"PG-13\" in the United States; this version was released to cinemas on 1 April 2011, replacing the R-rated one. The PG-13 version of this film is not available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nReception\nBox office\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, the film was the highest earning film on its opening weekend. It took in \u00a33,510,000 from 395 cinemas. The Guardian said that it was one of the biggest takes in recent memory, and compared it to Slumdog Millionaire (2008), which, two years earlier, earned \u00a31.5 million less. The King's Speech continued a \"stunning three weeks\" atop the UK Box office, and earned over \u00a33 million for four consecutive weekends, the first film to do so since Toy Story 3 (2010). After five weeks on UK release, it was hailed as the most successful independent British film ever.In the United States The King's Speech opened with $355,450 (\u00a3220,000) in four cinemas. It holds the record for the highest per-cinema gross of 2010. It was widened to 700 screens on Christmas Day and 1,543 screens on 14 January 2011. It eventually made $138 million in North America overall.In Australia The King's Speech made more than A$6,281,686 (\u00a34 million) in the first two weeks, according to figures collected by the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia. The executive director of Palace Cinemas, Benjamin Zeccola, said customer feedback on the film was spectacular. \"It's our No.1 for all the period, all throughout the country. ... I think this is more successful than Slumdog Millionaire and a more uplifting film. It's a good example of a film that started out in the independent cinemas and then spread to the mainstream cinemas.\"Of the film's net profit, estimated to amount to $30\u201340 million (\u00a320\u201325 million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% was to be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who were to receive their bonuses before the other stakeholders. The remaining profit was to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors. The UK Film Council invested \u00a31 million of public funds from the United Kingdom lottery into the film. In March 2011 Variety estimated that the return could be between fifteen and twenty times that. The Council's merger into the British Film Institute means that the profits were to be returned to that body.\n\nCritical response\nThe King's Speech has received widespread critical acclaim, with Firth's performance receiving universal praise. Bonham Carter and Rush were also widely praised with both going on to win BAFTAs and receiving Academy Award nominations. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 94% based on reviews from 297 critics; the film's average rating was calculated as 8.60\/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Colin Firth gives a masterful performance in The King's Speech, a predictable but stylishly produced and rousing period drama.\" Metacritic gave the film a weighted score of 88\/100, based on 41 critical reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade. Empire gave the film five stars out of five, commenting, \"You'll be lost for words.\" Lisa Kennedy of The Denver Post gave the film full marks for its humane qualities and craftsmanship: \"It is an intelligent, winning drama fit for a king \u2013 and the rest of us\", she said. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars, commenting that \"what we have here is a superior historical drama and a powerful personal one.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave four stars out of five, stating, \"Tom Hooper's richly enjoyable and handsomely produced movie ... is a massively confident crowd-pleaser.\"Manohla Dargis, whilst generally ambivalent towards the film, called the lead performances one of its principal attractions. \"With their volume turned up, the appealing, impeccably professional Mr. Firth and Mr. Rush rise to the acting occasion by twinkling and growling as their characters warily circle each other before settling into the therapeutic swing of things and unknowingly preparing for the big speech that partly gives the film its title,\" she wrote. The Daily Telegraph called Guy Pearce's performance as Edward VIII \"formidable ... with glamour, charisma and utter self-absorption\". Empire said he played the role well as \"a flash harry flinty enough to shed a nation for a wife.\" The New York Times thought he was able to create \"a thorny tangle of complications in only a few abbreviated scenes\". Hooper praised the actor in the DVD commentary, saying he \"nailed\" the 1930s royal accent. Richard Corliss of Time magazine named Colin Firth's performance one of the Top 10 Movie Performances of 2010.\n\nAllocin\u00e9, a French cinema website, gave the film an average of four out of five stars, based on a survey of 21 reviews. Le Monde, which characterised the film as the \"latest manifestation of British narcissism\" and summarised it as \"We are ugly and boring, but, By Jove!, we are right!\", nevertheless admired the performances of Firth, Rush, and Bonham Carter. It said that, though the film swept British appeasement under the carpet, it was still enjoyable.Slovenian Marxist philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has incorporated the film into his critique of ideology by describing it as \"reactionary,\" interpreting the king's stutter as evidence that he \"displays a minimum of common sense, experiencing the stupidity of seriously accepting that one is king by divine will\" and claiming that \"the task of the Australian voice-coach is to render him stupid enough to accept his being a king as his natural property.\" \u017di\u017eek thus interprets the king's stutter as a case of what is referred to in Lacanian psychoanalysis as \"symbolic castration.\"Queen Elizabeth II, the daughter and successor of King George VI, was sent two copies of the film before Christmas 2010. The Sun newspaper reported she had watched the film in a private screening at Sandringham House. A palace source described her reaction as being \"touched by a moving portrayal of her father\". Seidler called the reports \"the highest honour\" the film could receive.\n\nDepiction of stuttering\nThe British Stammering Association welcomed the release of The King's Speech, congratulating the film makers on their \"realistic depiction of the frustration and the fear of speaking faced by people who stammer on a daily basis.\" It said that \"Colin Firth's portrayal of the King's stammer in particular strikes us as very authentic and accurate.\" The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists welcomed the film, and launched their \"Giving Voice\" campaign around the time of its commercial release.Disfluency advocate Jonah Lehrer called the film \"an inspiring tale\" and praised its portrayal of the troubles suffered by Firth's character.\n However, Lehrer and other advocates criticized the film's depiction of stuttering as a result of emotional repression and childhood trauma. The treatment performed by Rush's character also drew criticism. Lehrer did admit it was a necessary artistic license: \"[the film] would have been a rather tedious piece of entertainment if the climactic scene involved Logue telling the monarch that his primary motor cortex was to blame.\"Science journalist Jeremy Hsu wrote that the film \"mainly succeeds by tackling the social stigma that surrounds stuttering.\" However, similar to Lehrer, he disapproved that it perpetuated myths about the condition, namely its relationship with childhood trauma and overly strict parenting.Columnist Jane Ahlin praised the film as it \"brings out of the shadows a common problem figuring into the lives of children and adults from every culture around the world.\" At the same time, she stated, \"heartwarming though the movie The King's Speech is, as someone who married a stutterer and is the mother of a stutterer, I'm not sure it does anything to put myths about stuttering to rest.\" She criticized the depiction of family and social dynamics as causes of the condition, as well as the portrayal of stutterering as connected to emotional or psychological problems.\n\nAwards and nominations\nAt the 83rd Academy Awards, The King's Speech won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth), and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler). The film had received 12 Oscar nominations, more than any other film in that year. Besides the four categories it won, the film received nominations for Best Cinematography (Danny Cohen) and two for the supporting actors (Bonham Carter and Rush), as well as two for its mise-en-sc\u00e8ne: Art Direction and Costumes.At the 64th British Academy Film Awards, it won seven awards, including Best Film, Outstanding British Film, Best Actor for Firth, Best Supporting Actor for Rush, Best Supporting Actress for Bonham Carter, Best Original Screenplay for Seidler, and Best Music for Alexandre Desplat. The film had been nominated for 14 BAFTAs, more than any other film. At the 68th Golden Globe Awards, Firth won for Best Actor.  The film won no other Golden Globes, despite earning seven nominations, more than any other film.At the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards, Firth won the Best Actor award and the entire cast won Best Ensemble, meaning Firth went home with two acting awards in one evening. Hooper won the Directors Guild of America Awards 2010 for Best Director. The film won the Darryl F. Zanuck Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture at the Producers Guild of America Awards 2010.The King's Speech won the People's Choice Award at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, Best British Independent Film at the 2010 British Independent Film Awards, and the 2011 Goya Award for Best European Film from the Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematogr\u00e1ficas de Espa\u00f1a (Spanish Academy of Cinematic Art and Science).\n\nSee also\nBertie & Elizabeth (2002), a television film which also addresses the stammering of the king (played by James Wilby).

Vernon Watson (1886\u20131952), better known under his stage name Nosmo King, was a popular English variety artist. He was touring the music halls before World War I, but he remained relatively obscure until the 1920s, when he went by Nosmo King. He was the father of actor Jack Watson.\n\nEarly years\nComing from a rural background near Peterborough, Watson showed a leaning towards things theatrical and it was evident that he had a rare talent for mimicry. In 1911, he turned professional, using his real name, doing impressions of the leading comedians of the day.\nThen, when Frank Tinney, the American black-faced comedian, came to the UK, Watson added an impression of him to his repertoire. He noticed that this impression gained him great applause, and when Tinney returned to the United States, Watson gave thought to a different style of act based on a black-faced personality.\n\nFame\nOpportunity for this came about in the early 1930s in Leeds, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, which boasted two variety theatres, run by two rival organisations. The Great Depression was beginning to bite, and on hearing that the rival theatre had lost its comic, he determined to double his income by doing both shows (four performances a night), travelling between the two theatres by taxi, disguising himself by blacking up.\nWatson had the black-face study ready, but was stuck for a name. Then inspiration came to his aid. The scene dock doors backstage were partly open and the two halves read \"No Smo\" & \"king\". That was it. From then on, the character would be Nosmo King.\nNosmo King became a huge star and a household name. The stage act of Nosmo King & Hubert developed when his son Jack Watson joined him as straight man directly from school. Vernon Watson made his last bow and he was to be Nosmo for good when his speciality became long comic monologues.\nDuring a later interview, he made two remarkable confessions. Someone pointed out that a cigar-smoking figure was hardly compatible with the name and suggested he gave up. This he found remarkably difficult, but he eventually accomplished it with the aid of snuff. The second confession was that he had never at any time set eyes on Frank Tinney.\nDuring World War II, Nosmo King reverted to going solo, the reason being that his son, playing \"Hubert,\" had joined up.\nThe end came for Nosmo King early in 1952 when Watson died in his sleep in his Chelsea flat.\nHe is buried in Thorney Cemetery near Peterborough, with \"Nosmo King\" on his headstone.\n\nActs\nOne of Nosmo's act starters was when a young pageboy would come over to him carrying his luggage. Once he had handed it to Nosmo, Nosmo would say to him \"how much do I owe you\" and the boy would say \"2 nicker\" (a colloquialism for two pounds) whilst making a V sign at him. Nosmo took this as an insult and would slap the boy across the face, then the boy would slap Nosmo across his face in return.\n\nSee also\nPaul Shannon, a Pittsburgh radio announcer, also used the name 'Nosmo King' for a character.\nNosmo King was the name of a 1994 album by jazz guitarist John Abercrombie and Andy LaVerne.\nSee also English singer Jonathan King who appeared on Top of the Pops in the early 1970s as Nosmo King. When he was asked about the name, he said it was a pun which I didn't get at the time as I was very young. He also implied that he had come up with the name himself.","label":"longbench","length":16273,"title":"Passage 1:"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nGold Hill, North Carolina\nGold Hill is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in southeastern Rowan County, North Carolina, United States near the Cabarrus County line. It was first listed as a CDP in the 2020 census with a population of 372. It is situated near the Yadkin River and is served by U.S. Highway 52 and Old Beatty Ford Road. Gold was found in this small town outside Salisbury in the 19th century.\n\nMining\nGold was first discovered in what would become the town of Gold Hill in southeastern Rowan County in 1824. $6 million in gold was mined here prior to the Civil War and a mint was located in Charlotte as a result. In the 1840s, Gold Hill was \"a raucous mining camp town with a considerable number of saloons and brothels.\" The Barnhardt shaft, named for Col. George Barnhardt of the Reed Mine (NC State Historic Site) family, was opened in 1842 and reached a depth of 435 feet. The Earnhardt\/Randolph Mine Shaft was opened in 1843 across the street from the Barnhardt Mine and reached a depth of 850 feet becoming the deepest gold mine in the United States. The Barnhardt and Randolph mines together were described as \"the richest and most productive gold mines east of the Mississippi\". Gold Hill was incorporated in 1843 and had a population of 3000 people and a total of 23 mines in the Gold Hill Mining District. The California Gold Rush and the American Civil War significantly reduced the mining activity. Although some mining occurred in the years following the Civil War a greater resurgence of mining began with the purchase of the Gold Hill Mines and the establishment of 'The New Gold Hill Mining Company' based in London, England. Considerable profits were realized with gold being shipped to England during the period of 1880-1900. Production came to an end by 1915.\n\nTourist attraction\nThe town's first Founders' Day, which was not called by that name, took place in 1989 and was not intended to become an annual event, but it ended up being so popular that a steering committee was formed for the purpose of starting a foundation to find and preserve the town's heritage. The Historic Gold Hill and Mines Foundation, Inc. began in 1992, and that year, a second Founders' Day took place. Gold Hill Mines Historic Park began with a donation of 16 acres by Billie Johnson and was dedicated in 1993; by the 25th Founders' Day it was 70 acres. Founders' Day became an annual event on the fourth Saturday in September, and they were moved from the fire department to the park located  at 735 St. Stephens Church Road.E.H. Montgomery General Store, Mauney\u2019s Store, the jail and a rock wall date back to the 1840s. Several buildings were moved to and restored for what has been described as a \"re-creation\" of a historic village. A gas station built in 1928 was moved from U.S. 52 in 1998. The File Store from Craven, North Carolina near Salisbury was built in 1906 and moved to Gold Hill in 2001. A miner's cabin was moved to Gold Hill in 2011 and became a bakery.The Daniel Isenhour House and Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.Website: https:\/\/historicgoldhill.org\n\nDemographics\n2020 census\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic\/Latino as an ethnic category. This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category. Hispanics\/Latinos can be of any race.\nPassage 2:\nCleveland, North Carolina\nCleveland is a town in the Cleveland Township of Rowan County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 871 at the 2010 census.\n\nHistory\nThe town dates from 1831 but was not incorporated until 1833.  The first post office in Cleveland, Cowansville, was established in 1831.  By 1850, prior to the US Civil War and the completion of the Western Carolina Railroad, the town was named Rowan Mills.  Rowan Mills was named for the five story flour mill that Osborn Giles Foard owned in Cleveland.  The Rowan Mills Post Office served the area north of the rail line and extended into Scotch Irish Township after the Civil War in 1870.  The town and post office kept the name Rowan Mills until 1876 when it was renamed Third Creek Station.  In the 1880 U.S. Census, there were 17 families and 89 persons living in the Village of Third Creek Station.  It was not until 1884 that the townspeople renamed the town after Grover Cleveland, who is supposed to have visited the town during his presidential campaign.\n\nGeography\nCleveland is located at 35\u00b043\u203252\u2033N 80\u00b040\u203244\u2033W (35.731021, -80.678963).According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2), all  land.\n\nDemographics\n2020 census\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 846 people, 392 households, and 283 families residing in the town.\n\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 871 people, 328 households, and 236 families residing in the town. The population density was 580.7 inhabitants per square mile (224.2\/km2). There were 377 housing units at an average density of 251.3 per square mile (97.0\/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 66.9% White, 24.1% African American, 5.4% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.5% of the population.\nThere were 328 households, out of which 34.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.6% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.0% were non-families. 24.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.10.\nIn the town, the population was spread out, with 28.4% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 23.4% from 45 to 64, and 11.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.2 males.\nThe median income for a household in the town was $39,474, and the median income for a family was $58,000. Males had a median income of $51,000 versus $29,500 for females. The per capita income for the town was $19,506. About 13.1% of families and 20.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 25.0% of those under age 18 and 8.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\nTown twinning \/ sister city\nSince February 8, 2008, Cleveland has been twinned with Killyleagh, Northern Ireland.\n\nSee also\nCleveland Township\n2007 Freightliner wildcat strike\nPassage 3:\nCanada\u2013United States border\nThe Canada\u2013United States border (French: Fronti\u00e8re entre le Canada et les \u00c9tats-Unis) is the longest international border in the world. The terrestrial boundary (including boundaries in the Great Lakes, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts) is 8,891 km (5,525 mi) long. The land border has two sections: Canada's border with the contiguous United States to its south, and with the U.S. state of Alaska to its west. The bi-national International Boundary Commission deals with matters relating to marking and maintaining the boundary, and the International Joint Commission deals with issues concerning boundary waters. The agencies currently responsible for facilitating legal passage through the international boundary are the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nHistory\n18th century\nThe Treaty of Paris of 1783 ended the American Revolutionary War between Great Britain and the United States. In the second article of the Treaty, the parties agreed on all boundaries of the United States, including, but not limited to, the boundary to the north along then-British North America. The agreed-upon boundary included the line from the northwest angle of Nova Scotia to the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut River and proceeded down along the middle of the river to the 45th parallel of north latitude.\nThe parallel had been established in the 1760s as the boundary between the provinces of Quebec and New York (including what would later become the State of Vermont). It was surveyed and marked by John Collins and Thomas Valentine from 1771 to 1773.The St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes became the boundary further west, between the United States and what is now Ontario. Northwest of Lake Superior, the boundary followed rivers to the Lake of the Woods. From the northwesternmost point of the Lake of the Woods, the boundary was agreed to go straight west until it met the Mississippi River. In fact, that line never meets the river since the river's source is further south.\n\nJay Treaty (1794)\nThe Jay Treaty of 1794 (effective 1796) created the International Boundary Commission, which was charged with surveying and mapping the boundary. It also provided for the removal of British military and administration from Detroit, as well as other frontier outposts on the U.S. side. The Jay Treaty was superseded by the Treaty of Ghent (effective 1815) concluding the War of 1812, which included pre-war boundaries.\n\n19th century\nSigned in December 1814, the Treaty of Ghent ended the War of 1812, returning the boundaries of British North America and the United States to the state they were prior to the war. In the following decades, the United States and the United Kingdom concluded several treaties that settled the major boundary disputes between the two, enabling the border to be demilitarized. The Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty of 1817 provided a plan for demilitarizing the two combatant sides in the War of 1812 and also laid out preliminary principles for drawing a border between British North America and the United States.\n\nLondon Convention (1818)\nThe Treaty of 1818 saw expansion of both British North America and the US, where the boundary extended westward along the 49th parallel, from the Northwest Angle at Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains. The treaty extinguished British claims to the south of that line up to the Red River Valley, which was part of Rupert's Land. The treaty also extinguished U.S. claims to land north of that line in the watershed of the Missouri River, which was part of the Louisiana Purchase. This amounted to three small areas, consisting of the northern part of the drainages of the Milk River (today in southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan), the Poplar River (Saskatchewan), and Big Muddy Creek (Saskatchewan). Along the 49th parallel, the border vista is theoretically straight, but in practice follows the 19th-century surveyed border markers and varies by several hundred feet in spots.\n\nWebster\u2013Ashburton Treaty (1842)\nDisputes over the interpretation of the border treaties and mistakes in surveying required additional negotiations, which resulted in the Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty of 1842. The treaty resolved the Aroostook War, a dispute over the boundary between Maine, New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada. The treaty redefined the border between New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York on the one hand, and the Province of Canada on the other, resolving the Indian Stream dispute and the Fort Blunder dilemma at the outlet to Lake Champlain.\nThe part of the 45th parallel that separates Quebec from the U.S. states of Vermont and New York had first been surveyed from 1771 to 1773 after it had been declared the boundary between New York (including what later became Vermont) and Quebec. It was surveyed again after the War of 1812. The U.S. federal government began to construct fortifications just south of the border at Rouses Point, New York, on Lake Champlain. After a significant portion of the construction was completed, measurements revealed that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) south of the surveyed line. The fort, which became known as \"Fort Blunder\", was in Canada, which created a dilemma for the U.S. that was not resolved until a provision of the treaty left the border on the meandering line as surveyed. The border along the Boundary Waters in present-day Ontario and Minnesota between Lake Superior and the Northwest Angle was also redefined.\n\nOregon Treaty (1846)\nAn 1844 boundary dispute during the Presidency of James K. Polk led to a call for the northern boundary of the U.S. west of the Rockies to be 54\u00b040\u2032N related to the southern boundary of Russia's Alaska Territory. However, Great Britain wanted a border that followed the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. The dispute was resolved in the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which established the 49th parallel as the boundary through the Rockies.\n\nBoundary surveys (mid\u201319th century)\nThe Northwest Boundary Survey (1857\u20131861) laid out the land boundary. However, the water boundary was not settled for some time. After the Pig War in 1859, arbitration in 1872 established the border between the Gulf Islands and the San Juan Islands.\nThe International Boundary Survey (or, the \"Northern Boundary Survey\" in the US) began in 1872. Its mandate was to establish the border as agreed to in the Treaty of 1818. Archibald Campbell led the way for the United States, while Donald Cameron, supported by chief astronomer Samuel Anderson, headed the British team. This survey focused on the border from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n20th century\nIn 1903, following a dispute that arose because of the Klondike Gold Rush, a joint United Kingdom\u2013Canada\u2013U.S. tribunal established the boundary of southeast Alaska.On April 11, 1908, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed, under Article IV of the Treaty of 1908 \"concerning the boundary between the United States and the Dominion of Canada from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean\", to survey and delimit the boundary between Canada and the U.S. through the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes, in accordance with modern surveying techniques, and thus accomplished several changes to the border.  In 1925, the International Boundary Commission's temporary mission became permanent for maintaining the survey and mapping of the border; maintaining boundary monuments and buoys; and keeping the border clear of brush and vegetation for 6 m (20 ft). This \"border vista\" extends for 3 m (9.8 ft) on each side of the line.In 1909, under the Boundary Waters Treaty, the International Joint Commission was established for Canada and the U.S. to investigate and approve projects that affect the waters and waterways along the border.\n\n21st century\nAs a result of the 2001 September 11 attacks, the Canada\u2013U.S. border was shut without any warning, and no goods or people were allowed to cross. In the wake of the impromptu border closure, procedures were jointly developed to ensure that commercial traffic could cross the border even if people were restricted from crossing. These procedures were later used for a border closure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\n2020\u20132021 closure\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and the United States, the governments of Canada and the United States agreed to close the border to \"non-essential\" travel on March 21, 2020, for an initial period of 30 days. The closure has been extended 15 times since then; it expired on July 21, 2021. However, in mid-June 2021, the Canadian government announced it will ease some entry requirements for fully vaccinated Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and foreign nationals starting on July 5, 2021. In mid-July, the Canadian government announced that fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents can visit Canada starting August 9, 2021. The American government reopened its land border to fully vaccinated Canadian citizens effective November 8, 2021. Provided that COVID cases remain stable and\/or decline, fully vaccinated international visitors can enter Canada starting September 7. The 2020\u201321 closure was reportedly the first blanket, long-term closure of the border since the War of 1812.Essential travel, as defined by Canadian and US regulations, includes travel for employment or education purposes. \"Non-essential\" travel to Canada, includes travel \"for an optional or discretionary purpose, such as tourism, recreation or entertainment.\" The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued defined non-essential travel to include \"tourism purposes (e.g., sightseeing, recreation, gambling, or attending cultural events)\" and gave an extensive, non-exhaustive definition of what sorts of travel qualify as essential.Business advocacy groups, noting the substantial economic impact of the closure on both sides of the border, called for more nuanced restrictions in place of the blanket ban on non-essential travel. The Northern Border Caucus, a group in the US Congress composed of members from border communities, made similar suggestions to the governments of both countries. Beyond the closure itself, US President Donald Trump also initially suggested the idea of deploying United States military personnel near the border with Canada in connection with the pandemic. He later abandoned the idea following vocal opposition from Canadian officials.\n\nSecurity\nLaw enforcement approach\nThe International Boundary is commonly referred to as the world's \"longest undefended border\", though this is true only in the military sense, as civilian law enforcement is present. It is illegal to cross the border outside border controls, as anyone crossing the border must be checked per immigration and customs laws. The relatively low level of security measures stands in contrast to that of the United States\u2013Mexico border (one-third length of Canada\u2013U.S. border), which is actively patrolled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking.\n\nParts of the International Boundary cross through mountainous terrain or heavily forested areas, but significant portions also cross remote prairie farmland and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, in addition to the maritime components of the boundary at the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans. The border also runs through the middle of the Akwesasne Nation and even divides some buildings found in communities in New England and Quebec.\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) identifies the chief issues along the border as domestic and international terrorism; drug smuggling and smuggling of products (such as tobacco) to evade customs duties; and illegal immigration. A June 2019 U.S. Government Accountability Office report identified specific staffing and resource shortfalls faced by the CBP on the Northern border that adversely affect enforcement actions; the U.S. Border Patrol \"identified an insufficient number of agents that limited patrol missions along the northern border\" while CBP Air and Marine Operations \"identified an insufficient number of agents along the northern border, which limited the number and frequency of air and maritime missions.\"There are eight U.S. Border Patrol sectors based on the Canada\u2013U.S. border, each covering a designated \"area of responsibility\"; the sectors are (from west to east) based in Blaine, Washington; Spokane, Washington; Havre, Montana; Grand Forks, North Dakota; Detroit, Michigan; Buffalo, New York; Swanton, Vermont; and Houlton, Maine.Following the September 11 attacks in the United States, security along the border was dramatically tightened by the two countries in both populated and rural areas. Both nations are also actively involved in detailed and extensive tactical and strategic intelligence sharing.\nIn December 2010, Canada and the United States were negotiating an agreement titled \"Beyond the Border: A Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Competitiveness\" which would give the U.S. more influence over Canada's border security and immigration controls, and more information would be shared by Canada with the U.S.\n\nSecurity measures\nResidents of both nations who own property adjacent to the border are forbidden to build within the 6-metre-wide (20 ft) boundary vista without permission from the International Boundary Commission. They are required to report such construction to their respective governments.\nAll persons crossing the border are required to report to the customs agency of the country they have entered. Where necessary, fences or vehicle blockades are used. In remote areas, where staffed border crossings are not available, there are hidden sensors on roads, trails, railways, and wooded areas, which are located near crossing points. There is no border zone; the U.S. Customs and Border Protection routinely sets up checkpoints as far as 100 miles (160 km) into U.S. territory.In August 2020, the United States constructed 3.8 km (2.4 mi) of short cable fencing along the border between Abbotsford, British Columbia, and Whatcom County, Washington.\n\nIdentification\nPrior to 2007, American and Canadian citizens were only required to produce a birth certificate and driver's license\/government-issued identification card when crossing the Canada\u2013United States border.However, in late 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the final rule of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), which pertained to new identification requirements for travelers entering the United States. This rule, which marked the first phase of the initiative, was implemented on January 23, 2007, specifying six forms of identification acceptable for crossing the U.S. border (depending on mode):\na valid passport\u2014required in order to enter by air;\na United States passport card;\nan enhanced driver's license\u2014issued by the U.S. States of Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec;\na trusted traveler program card (i.e. NEXUS, FAST, or SENTRI);\na valid Merchant Mariner Credential\u2014to be used when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business; and\na valid U.S. military identification card\u2014to be used when traveling on official orders.The requirement of a passport or an enhanced form of identification to enter the United States by air went into effect in January 2007; and went into effect for those entering the U.S. by land and sea in January 2008. Although the new requirements for land and sea entry went into legal effect in January 2008, its enforcement did not begin until June 2009. Since June 2009, every traveller arriving via a land or sea port-of-entry (including ferries) has been required to present one of the above forms of identification in order to enter the United States.\n\nConversely in order to cross into Canada, a traveler must also carry identification, as well as a valid visa (if necessary) when crossing the border. Forms of identification include a valid passport, a Canadian Emergency Travel Document, an enhanced driver's license issued by a Canadian province or territory, or an enhanced identification\/photo card issued by a Canadian province or territory. Several other documents may be used by Canadians to identify their citizenship at the border, although use of such documents requires it to be supported with additional photo identification.American and Canadian citizens who are members of a trusted traveler program such as FAST or NEXUS, may present their FAST or NEXUS card as an alternate form of identification when crossing the international boundary by land or sea, or when arriving by air from only Canada or the United States. Although permanent residents of Canada and the United States are eligible for FAST or NEXUS, they are required to travel with a passport and proof of permanent residency upon arrival at the Canadian border. American permanent residents who are NEXUS members also require Electronic Travel Authorization when crossing the Canadian border.\n\nSecurity issues\nSmuggling\nSmuggling of alcoholic beverages (\"rum running\") was widespread during the 1920s, when Prohibition was in effect nationally in the United States and parts of Canada.\nIn more recent years, Canadian officials have brought attention to drug, cigarette, and firearms smuggling from the United States, while U.S. officials have made complaints of drug smuggling via Canada. In July 2005, law enforcement personnel arrested three men who had built a 110-metre (360 ft) tunnel under the border between British Columbia and Washington, intended for the use of smuggling marijuana, the first such tunnel known on this border. From 2007 to 2010, 147 people were arrested for smuggling marijuana on the property of a bed-and-breakfast in Blaine, Washington, but agents estimate that they caught only about 5% of smugglers.Because of its location, Cornwall, Ontario, experiences ongoing smuggling\u2014mostly of tobacco and firearms from the United States. The neighboring Mohawk territory of Akwesasne straddles the Ontario\u2013Quebec\u2013New York borders, where its First Nations sovereignty prevents Ontario Provincial Police, S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Border Services Agency, Canadian Coast Guard, United States Border Patrol, United States Coast Guard, and New York State Police from exercising jurisdiction over exchanges taking place within the territory.\n\n2009 border occupation\nIn May 2009, the Mohawk people of Akwesasne occupied the area around the Canada Border Services Agency port of entry building to protest the Canadian government's decision to arm its border agents while operating on Mohawk territory.  The north span of the Seaway International Bridge  and the CBSA inspection facilities were closed.  During this occupation, the Canadian flag was replaced with the flag of the Mohawk people. Although U.S. Customs remained opened to southbound traffic, northbound traffic was blocked on the U.S. side by both American and Canadian officials. The Canadian border at this crossing remained closed for six weeks.  On July 13, 2009, the CBSA opened a temporary inspection station at the north end of the north span of the bridge in the city of Cornwall, allowing traffic to once again flow in both directions.The Mohawk people of Akwesasne have staged ongoing protests at this border.  In 2014 they objected to a process that made their crossing more tedious, believing it violated their treaty rights of free passage.  When traveling from the U.S. to Cornwall Island, they must first cross a second bridge into Canada, for inspection at the new Canadian border station. Discussions between inter-governmental agencies were being pursued on the feasibility of relocating the Canadian border inspection facilities on the U.S. side of the border.\n\n2017 border crossing crisis\nIn August 2017, the border between Quebec and New York saw an influx of up to 500 irregular crossings each day, by individuals seeking asylum in Canada. As a result, Canada increased border security and immigration staffing in the area, reiterating the fact that crossing the border irregularly had no effect on one's asylum status.From the beginning of January 2017 up until the end of March 2018, the RCMP intercepted 25,645 people crossing the border into Canada from an unauthorized point of entry. Public Safety Canada estimates another 2,500 came across in April 2018 for a total of just over 28,000.\n\nBorder lengths and regions\nThe length of the terrestrial boundary is 8,891 km (5,525 mi), of which 6,416 km (3,987 mi) is against the contiguous 48 states, and 2,475 km (1,538 mi) against Alaska. Eight out of thirteen provinces and territories of Canada and thirteen out of fifty U.S. states are located along this international boundary.\n\nYukon\nThe Canadian territory of Yukon shares its entire western border with the U.S. state of Alaska, beginning at the Beaufort Sea at 69\u00b039\u2032N 141\u00b000\u2032W and proceeds southwards along the 141st meridian west. At 60\u00b018\u2032N, the border proceeds away from the 141st meridian west in a southeastward direction, following the St. Elias Mountains. South of the 60th parallel north, the border continues into British Columbia.\n\nBritish Columbia\nBritish Columbia has two international borders with the United States: with the state of Alaska along BC's northwest, and with the contiguous United States along the southern edge of the province, including (west to east) Washington, Idaho, and Montana.BC's Alaskan border, continuing from Yukon's, proceeds through the St. Elias Mountains, followed by Mt. Fairweather at 58\u00b054\u2032N 137\u00b031\u2032W, where the border heads northwestward towards the Coast Mountains. At 59\u00b048\u2032N 135\u00b028\u2032W, the border begins a general southeastward direction along the Coast Mountains. The border eventually reaches the Portland Canal and follows it outward to the Dixon Entrance, which takes the border down and out into the Pacific Ocean, terminating it upon reaching international waters.\nBC's border along the contiguous U.S. begins southwest of Vancouver Island and northwest of the Olympic Peninsula, at the terminus of international waters in the Pacific Ocean. It follows the Strait of Juan de Fuca eastward, turning northeastward to enter Haro Strait. The border follows the strait in a northward direction, but turns sharply eastward through Boundary Pass, separating the Canadian Gulf Islands from the American San Juan Islands. Upon reaching the Strait of Georgia, the border turns due north and then towards the northwest, bisecting the strait until the 49th parallel north. After making a sharp turn eastbound, the border follows this parallel across the Tsawwassen Peninsula, separating Point Roberts, Washington from Delta, British Columbia, and continues into Alberta.\n\nPrairies\nThe entire Canada\u2013U.S. border in the provinces of both Alberta and Saskatchewan lies along the 49th parallel north. Both provinces share borders with the state of Montana, while, farther east, Saskatchewan also shares a border with North Dakota.Along with the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota (west to east), nearly the entire Canada\u2013U.S. border in Manitoba lies along the 49th parallel north. At the province's eastern end, however, the border briefly enters the Lake of the Woods, turning north at 48\u00b059\u2032N 95\u00b009\u2032W where it continues into land along the western end of Minnesota's Northwest Angle, the only part of the United States besides the state of Alaska that is north of the 49th parallel. The border reaches Ontario at 49\u00b023\u2032N 95\u00b009\u2032W.\n\nOntario\nThe province of Ontario shares its border (west to east) with the U.S. states of Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. The largest provincial international border, most of the border is a water boundary.  It begins at the north-westernmost point of Minnesota's Northwest Angle (49\u00b023\u2032N 95\u00b009\u2032W). From here, it proceeds eastward through the Angle Inlet into the Lake of the Woods, turning southward at 49\u00b019\u2032N 94\u00b048\u2032W where it continues into the Rainy River. The border follows the River to Rainy Lake, then subsequently through various smaller lakes, including Namakan Lake, Lac la Croix, and Sea Gull Lake, until it reaches the Pigeon River, which leads it out into Lake Superior. The border continues through Lake Superior and Whitefish Bay, into the St. Mary's River then the North Channel. At 45\u00b059\u2032N 83\u00b026\u2032W, the border turns southward into the False Detour Channel, from which it reaches Lake Huron. Through the Lake, the border heads southward until reaching the St. Clair River, leading it to Lake St. Clair. The border proceeds through Lake St. Clair, reaching the Detroit River, which leads it to Lake Erie. From Lake Erie the border is led into the Niagara River, which takes it into Lake Ontario. From here, the boundary heads northwestward until it reaches 43\u00b027\u2032N 79\u00b012\u2032W, where it makes a sharp turn towards the northeast. The border then reaches the St. Lawrence River, proceeding through it until finally, at 45\u00b000\u2032N 74\u00b040\u2032W, the border splits from the river and continues into Quebec.\n\nQuebec\nThe province of Quebec borders (west to east) the U.S. states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, beginning where the Ontario-New York border ends in the St. Lawrence River at the 45th parallel north. This border heads inland towards the east, remaining on or near the parallel. At 45\u00b000\u2032N 71\u00b030\u2032W, the border begins to follow various natural features of the Appalachian Mountains, continuing to do so until  46\u00b025\u2032N 70\u00b003\u2032W, where it heads north, then northeastward at 46\u00b041\u2032N 69\u00b059\u2032W. Finally, at 47\u00b027\u2032N 69\u00b013\u2032W, the border heads toward Beau Lake, going through it and continuing into New Brunswick.\n\nNew Brunswick\nThe entire border of New Brunswick is shared with the U.S. state of Maine, beginning at the southern tip of Beau Lake at 47\u00b018\u2032N 69\u00b003\u2032W, subsequently proceeding to the Saint John River. The border moves through the River until  47\u00b004\u2032N 67\u00b047\u2032W, where it splits from the river and heads southward into the Chiputneticook Lakes at 45\u00b056\u2032N 67\u00b047\u2032W, which subsequently leads the border to the St. Croix River. The border proceeds through the St. Croix to Passamaquoddy Bay, which then leads it to Grand Manan Island into the middle of the Bay of Fundy. Here, the border turns towards the south and terminates upon reaching international waters.\n\nCrossings and border straddling\nAirports\nThe U.S. maintains pre-clearance facilities (i.e. immigration offices) at eight Canadian airports with international air service to the United States: Calgary; Edmonton; Halifax Stanfield; Montreal\u2013Trudeau; Ottawa Macdonald\u2013Cartier; Toronto Island Airport (Billy Bishop Airport), Toronto\u2013Pearson, Vancouver; and Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson. These procedures expedite travel by allowing flights originating in Canada to land at a U.S. airport without being processed as an international arrival. Canada does not maintain equivalent personnel at U.S. airports due to the sheer number of Canada-bound flights from numerous U.S. departure locations.\n\nCross-border airports\nOne curiosity on the Canada\u2013U.S. border is the presence of six airports and eleven seaplane bases whose runways straddle the borderline. Such airports were built prior to the U.S. entry into World War II as a way to legally transfer U.S.-built aircraft, such as the Lockheed Hudson, to Canada under the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act. In the interest of maintaining neutrality, U.S. military pilots were forbidden to deliver combat aircraft to Canada. As result, the aircraft were flown to the border, where they landed, then were towed on their wheels over the border by tractors or horses overnight. The next day, the planes were crewed by RCAF pilots and flown to other locations, typically airbases in Eastern Canada and Newfoundland, from where they were flown to the United Kingdom and deployed in the Battle of Britain.\n\nPiney Pinecreek Border Airport is located in Piney, Manitoba and Pinecreek, Minnesota. The northwest\u2013southeast-oriented runway straddles the border, and there are two ramps: one in the U.S. and one in Canada. The airport is owned by the Minnesota Department of Transportation.International Peace Garden Airport is located in Boissevain, Manitoba and Dunseith, North Dakota adjacent to the International Peace Garden. The runway is entirely within North Dakota, but a ramp extends across the border to allow aircraft to access Canadian customs. While not jointly owned, it is operated as an international facility for customs clearance as part of the Peace Garden.\nCoronach\/Scobey Border Station Airport (or East Poplar Airport) is located in Coronach, Saskatchewan and Scobey, Montana. The airport is jointly owned by the Canadian and U.S. government, with its east\u2013west runway sited exactly on the borderline.\nCoutts\/Ross International Airport is located in Alberta and Montana. Like Coronach\/Scobey, the east\u2013west runway is sited exactly on the border. The airport is owned entirely by the Montana Department of Transportation (DOT) Aeronautics Division.\nDel Bonita\/Whetstone International Airport, located in Del Bonita, Alberta and Del Bonita, Montana, has an east\u2013west runway sited exactly on the border, similar to Coutts\/Ross. The airport is officially owned by the state of Montana and run by the state's DOT Aeronautics Division, thus it has been assigned a U.S. identifier only. The facility is set up for both the general public (15 passengers maximum per plane) as well as the American military.Avey Field State Airport is located in Washington and British Columbia. The privately owned airfield is mostly in the U.S., but several hundred feet of the north\u2013south runway extend into Canada. As such, both Canadian and U.S. customs are available. It is assigned a U.S. identifier, but does not have a Canadian one.\nSeveral seaplane bases have water runways that cross the border, though the extent to which they do may be difficult to ascertain. The land-based facilities for the bases are all contained within one country or the other, however, leading to multiple situations where twin seaplane bases may share the same body of water. The following seaplane facilities exist on the border:\n\nRouses Point SPB (New York \/ Quebec)\nVan Buren SPB (Maine \/ New Brunswick)\nSault Ste Marie SPB and Sault Ste. Marie Water Aerodrome (Michigan \/ Ontario)\nSand Point Lake Water Aerodrome (Minnesota \/ Ontario)\nInternational Falls SPB and Fort Frances Water Aerodrome (Minnesota \/ Ontario)\nBaudette International Airport and Rainy River Water Aerodrome (Minnesota \/ Ontario)\nHyder Seaplane Base and Stewart Water Aerodrome (Alaska \/ British Columbia)\n\nLand border crossings\nCurrently there are 119 legal land border crossings between the United States and Canada, 26 of which take place at a bridge or tunnel. Only 2 of the 119 crossings are one-way: the Churubusco\u2013Franklin Centre Border Crossing, where travelers may enter only the United States; and the Four Falls Border Crossing, where travelers may enter only Canada.\nThere are six roads that have unstaffed road crossings, and do not have border inspection services in one or both directions, where travelers are legally allowed to cross the border. Those that cross are required to report to customs, which are stationed farther within.\n\nTrail crossings\nThe Fourth Connecticut Lake Trail (New Hampshire\/Quebec) crosses several times while following the border vista before heading back to the United States.\nThe Pacific Crest Trail crosses into E. C. Manning Provincial Park in the remote North Cascades mountains. Hikers can only legally cross into Canada from the US and not vice-versa, requiring an advance permit.\n\nRail crossings\nThere are 39 railroads that cross the U.S.\u2013Canada border, nine of which are no longer in use. Eleven of these railroads cross the border at a bridge or tunnel.\nOnly three international rail lines currently carry passengers between the U.S. and Canada. At Vancouver's Pacific Central Station, passengers are required to pass through U.S. partial pre-clearance and pass their baggage through an X-ray machine before being allowed to board the Seattle-bound Amtrak Cascades train, which makes no further stops before crossing the border at Blaine, Washington, where the train stops for another CBP inspection. Pre-clearance facilities are not available for the popular Adirondack (New York City to Montreal) or Maple Leaf (New York City to Toronto) trains, since these lines have stops between Montreal or Toronto and the border. Instead, passengers must clear customs at a stop located at the actual border.\n\nSeaports\nThere are 13 international ferry crossings operating between the U.S. and Canada. Two of them carry passengers only and one carries only rail cars.  Four of the ferries operate only on a seasonal basis.\nSimilar to that of the pre-clearance facilities at Canadian airports, arrangements exist at major Canadian seaports that handle sealed direct import shipments into the U.S. Along the East coast, ferry services operate between the province of New Brunswick and the state of Maine, while on the West coast, they operate between British Columbia and the states of Washington and Alaska. There are also several ferry services in the Great Lakes operating between the province of Ontario and the states of Michigan, New York, and Ohio. The ferry between Maine and Nova Scotia ended its operations in 2009, resuming again in 2014.\nOn Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River, the Boldt Castle has a border control point with no specific location on the Canadian side. As such, Canadians must present identification to land on the island.\n\nCross-border buildings\nA line house is a building located so that an international boundary passes through it. There are several such buildings that exist along the U.S.\u2013Canada border:\n\nThe Haskell Free Library and Opera House straddles the border in Derby Line, Vermont, and Stanstead, Quebec.\nPrivate homes divided by the boundary line between Estcourt Station, Maine, and Poh\u00e9n\u00e9gamook, Quebec.\nPrivate homes divided between Beebe Plain, Quebec and Beebe Plain, Vermont;\nA seasonal home divided at the intersection of Matthias Lane in Alburgh, Vermont, and Chemin au Bord de l'Eau in Noyan, Quebec;\nA house divided between Richford, Vermont, and Abercorn, Quebec.\nThe Halfway House (also known as Taillon's International Hotel) is a tavern, built in 1820 before the border was surveyed, that straddles the border between Dundee, Quebec, and Fort Covington, New York.The Maine\u2013New Brunswick border divides the Aroostook Valley Country Club.\n\nBoundary divisions\nPractical exclaves\nTo be a true international exclave, all potential paths of travel from the exclave to the home country must cross over only the territory of a different country or countries. Like exclaves, practical exclaves are not contiguous with the land of the home country and have land access only through another country or countries. Unlike exclaves, they are not entirely surrounded by foreign territory. Hence, they are exclaves for practical purposes, without meeting the strict definition.\nThe term pene-exclave, also known as a \"functional\" or \"practical\" exclave,:\u200a31\u200a was defined by G. W. S. Robinson (1959) as \"parts of the territory of one country that can be approached conveniently \u2014 in particular by wheeled traffic \u2014 only through the territory of another country.\":\u200a283\u200a Thus, a pene-exclave has land borders with other territory but is not completely surrounded by the other's land or territorial waters.:\u200a60\u200a Catudal (1974) and Vinokurov (2007):\u200a31\u201333\u200a provide examples to further elaborate, including Point Roberts, Washington: \"Although physical connections by water with Point Roberts are entirely within the sovereignty of the United States, land access is only possible through Canada.\":\u200a113\u200a Practical exclaves can exhibit continuity of state territory across territorial waters but, nevertheless, a discontinuity on land, such as in the case of Point Roberts.:\u200a47\n\nPractical exclaves of Canada\nThe Quebec western portion of the Akwesasne reserve is a practical exclave of Canada because of the St. Lawrence River to the north, the St. Regis River to the east, New York State, U.S. to the south. To travel by land to elsewhere in Canada, one must drive through New York State.\nCampobello Island is another practical exclave located at the entrance to Passamaquoddy Bay, adjacent to the entrance to Cobscook Bay, and within the Bay of Fundy. The island is part of Charlotte County, New Brunswick, but is actually physically connected by the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge with Lubec, Maine, the easternmost tip of the continental United States.\nPremier, British Columbia is an abandoned mining site accessible only through Hyder, Alaska.\n\nPractical exclaves of the United States\nAlaska is a non-contiguous U.S. state bounded by the Bering Sea; the Arctic and Pacific oceans; and Canada's British Columbia and Yukon Territory. Additionally, because of the terrain, several municipalities in southeast Alaska (the \"Panhandle\") are inaccessible by road, except via Canada. Specifically, the town of Hyder, Alaska, is accessible only through Stewart, British Columbia, or by floatplane. Moreover, Haines and Skagway are accessible by road only through Canada, although there are car ferries which connect them to other Alaskan places.\nPoint Roberts, Washington is bounded by British Columbia, the Strait of Georgia, and Boundary Bay.\nIn Minnesota, Elm Point, two small pieces of land to its west (Buffalo Bay Point), and the Northwest Angle are bounded by the province of Manitoba and Lake of the Woods.\nIn Vermont, the Alburgh Tongue, as well as Province Point, which is the small end of a peninsula east of Alburgh, are bounded by Quebec and Lake Champlain.\n\nSplit features\nBetween Quebec and Vermont, Province Island is a piece of land that primarily lies in Canada, though a small portion of the island is situated in the U.S. state, lying south of the 45th parallel with a border vista marking the international boundary.\nCanusa Street in Beebe Plain, VT is the only portion of the Canada\u2013United States border split down the middle of a street.\nBetween North Dakota and Manitoba, the international border splits a peninsula within a lake on the border of Rolette County, North Dakota, and the Wakopa Wildlife Management Area, MB. Likewise, Lake Metigoshe, lying in the Township of Roland, borders the municipality of Winchester, Manitoba. The border splits a shoreline, putting Canadian cabins on one side and the beach and boat docks for those cabins on the U.S. side, while land access is only through Canada.\n\nRemaining boundary disputes\nMachias Seal Island and North Rock (Maine \/ New Brunswick)\nDixon Entrance (Alaska \/ British Columbia)\nBeaufort Sea (Alaska \/ Yukon)\nStrait of Juan de Fuca (Washington \/ British Columbia)\n\nSee also\nCanada Border Services Agency\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection\nUnited States Border Patrol interior checkpoints\nCanada\u2013United States relations\nIllegal immigration to Canada\nIllegal immigration to the United States\nIndian barrier state, British plans to set up a new country in the Old Northwest\nJohn Lewis Tiarks, a British surveyor of the border\nJoseph Smith Harris' account of the Northwest Boundary Survey\nMexico\u2013United States border\n\nFootnotes\nPassage 4:\nCyprus Popular Bank\nCyprus Popular Bank (from 2006 to 2011 known as Marfin Popular Bank) was the second-largest banking group in Cyprus behind the Bank of Cyprus until it was 'shuttered' in March 2013 and split into two parts. The 'good' Cypriot part was merged into the Bank of Cyprus (including insured deposits under 100,000 Euro) and the 'bad' part or legacy entity holds all the overseas operations as well as uninsured deposits above 100,000 Euro, old shares and bonds. The uninsured depositors were subject to a bail-in and became the new shareholders of the legacy entity.  As at May 2017, the legacy entity is one of the largest shareholders of Bank of Cyprus with 4.8% but does not hold a board seat. All the overseas operations, of the now defunct Cyprus Popular Bank, are also held by the legacy entity, until they are sold by the Special Administrator, at first Ms Andri Antoniadou, who ran the legacy entity for two years, from March 2013 until 3 March 2015. She tendered her resignation due to disagreements, with the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank Board members, who amended the lawyers of the legacy entity, without consulting her. Veteran banker Chris Pavlou who is an expert in Treasury and risk management took over as Special Administrator of the legacy entity in April 2015 until December 2016. The legacy entity is pursuing legal action against former major shareholder Marfin Investment Group.\nIts shares were listed on the Cyprus Stock Exchange and the Athens Stock Exchange. CPB had a network of more than 295 branches in Cyprus, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, the UK and Malta. The bank had applied to open a representative office in Beijing, People's Republic of China.Trading on the island as Laiki Bank (Laiki being the Greek word for Popular), as of September 2012 it held a 16% share of the market in loans and a 14.4% share of deposits.  The Bank made a series of large loans, many to Greek companies prior to and during their financial crisis. What followed has been described as \"billions handed out in bad loans created a financial time-bomb\". After the bank collapsed, it was rescued by the Cypriot government, which took 84% ownership on 30 June 2012 and as of March 2013 it is being dismantled as part of the 2012\u20132013 Cypriot financial crisis.\n\nHistory\nIn 1901, four leading citizens of Limassol\u2014Agathoclis Francoudis, Ioannis Kyriakides, Christodoulos Sozos and Neoklis Ioannides\u2014established the Popular Savings Bank of Limassol to encourage saving among the workforce. More than two decades later, in 1924, the bank changed its name from the Popular Savings Bank of Limassol to the Popular Bank of Limassol. The bank also became the first company in Cyprus to register as a public-traded company.\nThen in 1967, the Popular Bank of Limassol changed its name to Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB) to reflect the bank\u2019s expansion beyond Limassol. Expansion beyond Limassol followed quickly, with the establishment of its first branches in Nicosia,  Famagusta (1969), and Paphos and Larnaca (1970). Also in 1970, Midland Bank acquired 22% of the company's shares, making Midland a major shareholder in CPB.

Each of the 36 states is a semi-autonomous political unit that shares powers with the federal government as enumerated under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT), is the capital territory of Nigeria, and it is in this territory that the capital city of Abuja is located. The FCT is not a state but is administered by elected officials who are supervised by the federal government. Each state is subdivided into local government areas (LGAs). There are 774 local governments in Nigeria. Under the constitution, the 36 states are co-equal but not supreme because sovereignty resides with the federal government. The constitution can be amended by the National Assembly, but each amendment must be ratified by two-thirds of the 36 states of the federation.\n\nCurrent states and the Federal Capital Territory\nEvolution of Nigerian states\nGovernment\nStates of Nigeria have the right to organize and structure their individual governments in any way within the parameters set by the Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nLegislature\nAt the state level, the legislature is unicameral, with the number of its members equal to three times the number of legislators it has in the Federal House of Representatives. It has the power to legislate on matters on the concurrent list.\n\nExecutive\nAt the state level, the head of the executive is the governor, who has the power to appoint people to the state executive council, subject to the advice and consent of the state house of assembly (legislature). The head of a ministry at the state level is the commissioner, who is assisted by a permanent secretary, who is also a senior civil servant of the state.\n\nJudiciary\nThe Judiciary is one of the co-equal arms of the state government concerned with the interpretation of the laws of the state government. The judiciary is headed by the chief justice of the state appointed by the governor subject to the approval of the state house of assembly.\n\nChronology\nSee also\nList of Nigerian states by population\nISO 3166-2:NG\nList of state governors of Nigeria\n\nNotes\nSources\nGboyega Ajayi (2007).

It was released in July 2011 as the second single from her album Eleven. On November 30, 2011, the song received a nomination at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Country Solo Performance. To date, this is McBride\u2019s final Top 10 hit.\n\nContent\nThe song is about a 38-year-old woman who is supported by her husband while battling breast cancer. The subject of the song survives. Co-writer Sonya Isaacs' inspiration for the song was her mother, Lily, who is a breast cancer survivor. It is in F major with an approximate tempo of 70 beats per minute, a vocal range of F3-D5 and a main chord pattern of F2-B\u266d2-F2.\n\nCritical reception\nAmanda Hensel of Taste of Country gave the song five stars out of five, saying that McBride \"captures our hearts with this one, reminding us why she's one of the best in the business.\" Matt Bjorke of Roughstock also gave the song a positive review, writing that it has \"all the hallmarks of her best and most powerful tunes.\"\n\nCommercial performance\n\"I'm Gonna Love You Through It\" debuted at number 50 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of August 6, 2011. In its sixth week on the Hot 100, the song ascended to number 61. In January 2012, the song became McBride's first Top Ten hit since \"Anyway\" in 2007, nearly five years earlier. Two months later, it peaked at number 4 on the country chart.  The song has sold 561,000 copies in the US as of October 2015, and has since been certified Gold by the R.I.A.A\n\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by Roman White and premiered in August 2011.

It entered the UK Singles Chart on 22 May 1971 and spent 14 weeks there, peaking at No. 4. Covers of the song have been chart successes several times, including for Happy Mondays in 1990.\nIt was cited in the Guinness Book of Records as being the first song to have used a sample. However, according to the sleeve note of the CD reissue of the Kongos album, it is actually a tape loop of African drumming, and the use of tape loops and instruments using prerecorded samples such as the Mellotron and Optigan was well established by this time.\n\nChart performance\nCover versions\n1987 Australian versions\nIn 1987 three Australian bands (The Party Boys, Chantoozies and Exploding White Mice) each released their own cover version of \"He's Gonna Step on You Again\". The Party Boys' single was issued in May, and peaked at No. 1, for two weeks, in late July on the Australian Music Report chart while the Chantoozies version reached No. 36.\n\nThe Party Boys\nThe Party Boys were an Australian rock band with a floating membership that mostly performed cover versions and existed from 1982 until 1992. By 1987, the members were Kevin Borich on guitar and backing vocals, John Brewster on guitar and backing vocals, Paul Christie on drums and backing vocals, Richard Harvey on drums, Alan Lancaster on bass guitar and backing vocals, and John Swan on lead vocals. Their version also reached No. 10 on the New Zealand Singles Chart.

Municipally, it is incorporated as Krasnovishersky Municipal District. It is located in the northeast of the krai, in the valley of the Vishera River, and borders with the Komi Republic in the north, Sverdlovsk Oblast in the east, Cherdynsky District in the west, Solikamsky District in the south, and with the territory of the town of krai significance of Alexandrovsk in the southeast. The area of the district is 15,375 square kilometers (5,936 sq mi). Its administrative center is the town of Krasnovishersk. Population:  22,554\u2009(2010 Census); 27,871\u2009(2002 Census); 30,827\u2009(1989 Census). The population of Krasnovishersk accounts for 71.4% of the district's total population.\n\nGeography\nThe eastern part of the district is mostly mountainous, while the western part is mostly flat, with some hills with the height of about 190\u2013220 meters (620\u2013720 ft). The highest point of Perm Krai, Mount Tulymsky Kamen, is located in the district. There are many rivers in the district, including the Vishera River with its tributaries the Yazva, the Vels, the Uls, and many others. The town of Krasnovishersk is located 320 kilometers (200 mi) from the city of Perm. Natural resources of the district include diamonds, gold, oil, natural gas, and others.\nThe climate is temperate continental. The average annual temperature is +0.1 \u00b0C (32.2 \u00b0F); annual precipitation is 550\u2013700 millimeters (22\u201328 in). Up to 87% of the district's territory is covered by forests. In the extreme northeast of the district the Vishera Nature Reserve is located.\n\nHistory\nThe district was established on January 13, 1941.

It was released as the second single from Carmen's self-titled debut solo album and peaked at No.11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1976, remaining in the Top 40 for ten weeks. The song reached No.1 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart. In Canada, it was a hit at No. 1 on both charts.The melody of \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\" is based on the third movement (Adagio) from Symphony No. 2 by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.\nBillboard described the song as a \"ballad with characteristically good Carmen lyrics and vocals and lush orchestration.\" Cash Box said that it \"has a hook-filled melody and chorus\" and that \"the tune will doubtless be covered by many artists, but the others will have to work hard to measure up to Carmen's version of his own song.\" Record World called it a \"lush offering driven by an emotive performance.\"On his second solo LP, Boats Against the Current, Carmen had a subsequent Top 40 hit entitled \"She Did It\", a happy answer to the loneliness and lovelessness described in this song and its equally melancholy predecessor, \"All By Myself\".\n\nTelevision performance\nCarmen performed \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\" and his prior hit, \"All By Myself\" on The Midnight Special television program on July 23, 1976 (season 4, episode 37).  The show was hosted by The Spinners.\n\nCharts\nNotable cover versions\nAustralian singer-songwriter Mark Holden's 1975 debut studio album Dawn in Darkness, which consisted entirely of original songs, was a commercial failure, selling only approximately 2,000 copies. In April 1976, Holden received a call from Colin Petersen, EMI Music Australia's A&R, who suggested he cover \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\". In his 2017 autobiography, Holden said recording it \"was a chance for me to have a hit\". He promoted the song by performing it on the Australian music television program Countdown while handing out red carnations to the audience. It became an infamous performance which led to Holden's nickname of \"The Carnation Kid\" His version, released in April 1976 as his debut single, peaked at No.13 on the Kent Music Report, becoming a commercial success. It was the 71st-biggest selling single in Australia in 1976.Unlike \"All by Myself,\" Carmen's version of \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\" was not released in Australia and therefore did not chart. Also in 1976, Dana reached No.31 in the UK  with her cover of the song. Her British release charted concurrently with the versions by Carmen and Holden.\n\nSee also\nList of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1976 (U.S.)\nList of number-one singles of 1976 (Canada)\nPassage 12:\nVirginia, Lempira\nVirginia (Spanish pronunciation: [bi\u027e\u02c8xinja]) is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira.\nVirginia is located in Lempira Honduras and shares a border with El Salvador. Many Virginians travel to El Salvador to do their shopping, because the Honduran cities are far away from Virginia.\nIt is one of the smallest municipalities of the Lempira department. It is 15 km or 30 minutes away from Mapulaca if accessed through Gracias.\n\nHistory\nIt was founded back in 1830. In the national division of 1889 it was one municipality of Candelaria.\n\nGeography\nIt is situated in a semi flat place and surrounded by many hills.  The predominant vegetation corresponds to the sub tropical dry forest. In the municipality capital there are some inclined streets.\n\nBoundaries\nIts boundaries are: \n\nNorth : Candelaria municipality.\nSouth : El Salvador.\nEast  : Piraera municipality.\nWest  : Mapulaca municipality.\nSurface Extents: 36 km2\n\nResources\nSince it is on the border with El Salvador, it is much easier for people to go there to establish commercial activities. Also there are more and better jobs on the other side of the border, with the advantage of receiving their wages in US dollars. It is not an ideal location for coffee plantations, therefore corn and beans crops became important (even though they are for local consumption); followed by cattle raising. Like the rest of the department, it has electricity and mobile communication services.\n\nPopulation\nPopulation: The amount of inhabitants was 2,734 and according to INE Honduras estimates, there will be 2,574 in 2015.\nVillages: 5\nSettlements: 35\n\nDemographics\nAt the time of the 2013 Honduras census, Virginia municipality had a population of 2,548. Of these, 97.06% were Mestizo, 2.90% Indigenous (2.86% Lenca) and 0.04% Black or Afro-Honduran.\n\nTourism\nAs for the remaining 15 km, although this dirt road is not in the best condition, it is still an easy drive. A half-hour visit will be enough to see all there is to see in the municipality capital. For those who are interested in rural and quiet towns, this is a good place to visit. Surprisingly, the mobile phone signal from El Salvador is stronger than the Honduran signal. Since it is near the Lempa River, the local pastime is going there to bathe. The local holidays and festivals attract many visitors.\n\nLocal Holidays: \"Santa Lucia\" day on December 13.","label":"longbench","length":16311,"title":"Passage 1:"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nPolar Satellite Launch Vehicle\nThe Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is an expendable medium-lift launch vehicle designed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into sun-synchronous orbits, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV in 1993, only commercially available from Russia. PSLV can also launch small size satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).Some notable payloads launched by PSLV include India's first lunar probe Chandrayaan-1, India's first interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) and India's first space observatory, Astrosat.PSLV has gained credibility as a leading provider of rideshare services for small satellites, owing to its numerous multi-satellite deployment campaigns with auxiliary payloads, usually ride-sharing along with an Indian primary payload. As of June 2022, PSLV has launched 345 foreign satellites from 36 countries. Most notable among these was the launch of PSLV-C37 on 15 February 2017, successfully deploying 104 satellites in sun-synchronous orbit, tripling the previous record held by Russia for the highest number of satellites sent to space on a single launch, until 24 January 2021, when SpaceX launched the Transporter-1 mission on a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 143 satellites into orbit.Payloads can be integrated in tandem configuration employing a Dual Launch Adapter. Smaller payloads are also placed on equipment deck and customized payload adapters.\n\nDevelopment\nStudies by the PSLV Planning group under S Srinivasan to develop a vehicle capable of delivering a 600 kg payload to a 550 km sun-synchronous orbit from SHAR began in 1978. Among 35 proposed configurations, four were picked; by November 1980, a vehicle configuration with two strap-ons on a core booster (S80) with 80 tonne solid propellant loading each, a liquid stage with 30 tonne propellant load (L30), and an upper stage called the Perigee-Apogee System (PAS) was being considered.By 1981, confidence grew in remote sensing spacecraft development with the launch of Bhaskara-1, and the PSLV project objectives were upgraded to have the vehicle deliver a 1000 kg payload into a 900 km SSO. As technology transfer of Viking rocket engine firmed up, a new lighter configuration with the inclusion of a liquid powered stage was selected. Funding was approved in July 1982 for the finalized design, employing a single large S125 solid core as first stage with six 9 tonne strap-ons (S9) derived from the SLV-3 first stage, liquid fueled second stage (L33), and two solid upper stages (S7 and S2.) This configuration needed further improvement to meet the orbital injection accuracy requirements of IRS satellites, and hence, the solid terminal stage (S2) was replaced with a pressure fed liquid fueled stage (L1.8 or LUS) powered by twin engines derived from roll control engines of the first stage. Apart from increasing precision, liquid upper stage also absorbed any deviation in performance of solid third stage. The final configuration of PSLV-D1 to fly in 1993 was (6 \u00d7 S9 + S125) + L37.5 + S7 + L2.The inertial navigation systems are developed by ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) at Thiruvananthapuram. The liquid propulsion for the second and fourth stages of the PSLV as well as the Reaction control systems (RCS) are developed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) at Valiamala near Thiruvananthapuram, kerala. The solid propellant motors are processed at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, which also carries out launch operations.\nThe PSLV was first launched on 20 September 1993. The first and second stages performed as expected, but an attitude control problem led to the collision of the second and third stages at separation, and the payload failed to reach orbit. After this initial setback, the PSLV successfully completed its second mission in 1994. The fourth launch of PSLV suffered a partial failure in 1997, leaving its payload in a lower than planned orbit. In November 2014, the PSLV had launched 34 times with no further failures. (Although launch 41: August 2017 PSLV-C39 was unsuccessful.)\nPSLV continues to support Indian and foreign satellite launches especially for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. It has undergone several improvements with each subsequent version, especially those involving thrust, efficiency as well as weight. In November 2013, it was used to launch the Mars Orbiter Mission, India's first interplanetary probe.In June 2018, the Union Cabinet approved \u20b96,131 crore (equivalent to \u20b972 billion or US$900 million in 2023) for 30 operational flights of the PSLV scheduled to take place between 2019 and 2024.ISRO is working towards handing over the production and operation of PSLV to private industry through a joint venture. On 16 August 2019, NewSpace India Limited issued an invitation to tender for manufacturing PSLV entirely by private industries. On 5 September 2022, NewSpace India Limited signed a contract with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Larsen & Toubro led conglomerate for the production of five PSLV-XL launch vehicles after they won competitive bidding. Under this contract, they have to deliver their first PSLV-XL within 24 months and the remaining four vehicles every six months.\n\nVehicle description\nThe PSLV has four stages, using solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately.\n\nFirst stage (PS1)\nThe first stage, one of the largest solid rocket boosters in the world, carries 138 t (136 long tons; 152 short tons) of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene-bound (HTPB) propellant and develops a maximum thrust of about 4,800 kN (1,100,000 lbf). The 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) diameter motor case is made of maraging steel and has an empty mass of 30,200 kg (66,600 lb).Pitch and yaw control during first stage flight is provided by the Secondary Injection Thrust Vector Control (SITVC) System, which injects an aqueous solution of strontium perchlorate into the S139 exhaust divergent from a ring of 24 injection ports to produce asymmetric thrust. The solution is stored in two cylindrical aluminium tanks strapped to the core solid rocket motor and pressurised with nitrogen. Underneath these two SITVC tanks, Roll Control Thruster (RCT) modules with small bi-propellant (MMH\/MON) liquid engine are also attached.On the PSLV-G and PSLV-XL, first stage thrust is augmented by six strap-on solid boosters. Four boosters are ground-lit and the remaining two ignite 25 seconds after launch. The solid boosters carry 9 t (8.9 long tons; 9.9 short tons) or 12 t (12 long tons; 13 short tons) (for PSLV-XL configuration) propellant and produce 510 kN (110,000 lbf) and 719 kN (162,000 lbf) thrust respectively. Two strap-on boosters are equipped with SITVC for additional attitude control. The PSLV-CA uses no strap-on boosters.\nFirst stage separation is aided by four pairs of retro-rockets installed on inter-stage (1\/2L). During staging, these eight rockets help push away the spent stage away from second stage.\n\nSecond stage (PS2)\nThe second stage is powered by a single Vikas engine and carries 41.5 t (40.8 long tons; 45.7 short tons) of Earth store-able liquid propellant \u2013 unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as oxidiser in two tanks separated by a common bulkhead. It generates a maximum thrust of 800 kN (180,000 lbf). The engine is gimbaled (\u00b14\u00b0) in two planes to provide pitch and yaw control by two actuators, while roll control is provided by a Hot gas Reaction Control Motor (HRCM) that ejects hot gases diverted from gas generator of Vikas engine.On inter-stage (1\/2U) of PS2  there are two pairs of ullage rockets to maintain positive acceleration during PS1\/PS2 staging and also two pairs of retro-rockets to help push away spent stage during PS2\/PS3 staging.Second stage also carries some quantity of water in a toroidal tank at its bottom. Water spray is used to cool hot gases from Vikas' gas generator to about 600 \u00b0C before entering turbopump. Propellant and water tanks of second stage are pressurized by Helium.\n\nThird stage (PS3)\nThe third stage uses 7.6 t (7.5 long tons; 8.4 short tons) of HTPB solid propellant and produces a maximum thrust of 250 kN (56,000 lbf). Its burn duration is 113.5 seconds. It has a Kevlar-polyamide fibre case and a submerged nozzle equipped with a flex-bearing-seal gimbaled nozzle with \u00b12\u00b0 thrust vector for pitch and yaw control. Roll control is provided by the fourth stage reaction control system (RCS) during thrust phase as well as during combined-coasting phase under which burnt-out PS3 remains attached to PS4.\n\nFourth stage (PS4)\nThe fourth stage is powered by regeneratively cooled twin engines, burning monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON). Each pressure fed engine generates 7.4 kN (1,700 lbf) thrust and is gimbaled (\u00b13\u00b0) to provide pitch, yaw and roll control during powered flight. Coast phase attitude control is provided by six 50N RCS thrusters. The stage is pressurized by Helium and carries up to 2,500 kg (5,500 lb) of propellant in the PSLV and PSLV-XL and 2,100 kg (4,600 lb) in the PSLV-CA.On PSLV-C29\/TeLEOS-1 mission, the fourth stage demonstrated re-ignition capability for the first time which was used in many subsequent flights to deploy payloads in multiple orbits on a single campaign.As a space debris mitigation measure, PSLV fourth stage gets passivated by venting pressurant and propellant vapour after achieving main mission objectives. Such passivation prevents any unintentional fragmentation or explosion due to stored internal energy.\n\nPS4 stage as orbital platform\nPS4 has carried hosted payloads like AAM on PSLV-C8, Rubin 9.1\/Rubin 9.2 on PSLV-C14 and mRESINS on PSLV-C21. But now, PS4 is being augmented to serve as a long duration orbital platform after completion of primary mission. PS4 Orbital Platform (PS4-OP) will have its own power supply, telemetry package, data storage and attitude control for hosted payloads.On PSLV-C37 and PSLV-C38 campaigns, as a demonstration PS4 was kept operational and monitored for over ten orbits after delivering spacecraft.PSLV-C44 was the first campaign where PS4 functioned as independent orbital platform for short duration as there was no on-board power generation capacity. It carried KalamSAT-V2 as a fixed payload, a 1U cubesat by Space Kidz India based on Interorbital Systems kit.On PSLV-C45 campaign, the fourth stage had its own power generation capability as it was augmented with an array of fixed solar cells around PS4 propellant tank. Three payloads hosted on PS4-OP were, Advanced Retarding Potential Analyzer for Ionospheric Studies (ARIS 101F) by IIST, experimental AIS payload by ISRO and AISAT by Satellize. To function as orbital platform, fourth stage was put in spin-stabilized mode using its RCS thrusters.On PSLV-C53 campaign the PS4-OP was referred as PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) and it hosted six payloads. POEM was first PSLV fourth stage based orbital platform to be actively stabilised using Helium based cold gas thrusters after the primary mission and stage passivization.\n\nPayload fairing\nPayload fairing of PSLV, also referred as its \"Heatshield\" consists of a conical upper section with spherical nose-cap, a cylindrical middle section and a lower boat-tail section. Weighing 1,182 kilograms (2,606 lb), it has 3.2 meter diameter and 8.3 meter height. It has Isogrid construction and is made out of 7075 aluminum alloy with a 3 mm thick steel nose-cap. The two halves of fairing are separated using a pyrotechnic device based jettisoning system consisting horizontal and lateral separation mechanisms. To protect spacecraft from damage due to excessive acoustic loads during launch, the heatshield interior is lined with acoustic blankets.\n\nVariants\nISRO has envisaged a number of variants of PSLV to cater to different mission requirements. There are currently two operational versions of the PSLV \u2014 the core-alone (PSLV-CA) without strap-on motors, and the (PSLV-XL) version, with six extended length (XL) strap-on motors carrying 12 tonnes of HTPB based propellant each. These configurations provide wide variations in payload capabilities up to 3,800 kg (8,400 lb) in LEO and 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) in sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nPSLV-G\nThe standard or \"Generic\" version of the PSLV, PSLV-G had four stages using solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately and six strap-on motors (PSOM or S9) with 9 tonne propellant loading. It had capability to launch 1,678 kg (3,699 lb) to 622 km (386 mi) into sun-synchronous orbit. PSLV-C35 was the last operational launch of PSLV-G before its discontinuation.\n\nPSLV-CA\nThe PSLV-CA, CA meaning \"Core Alone\", model premiered on 23 April 2007. The CA model does not include the six strap-on boosters used by the PSLV standard variant but two SITVC tanks with Roll Control Thruster modules are still attached to the side of the first stage with addition of two cylindrical aerodynamic stabilizers. The fourth stage of the CA variant has 400 kg (880 lb) less propellant when compared to its standard version. It currently has capability to launch 1,100 kg (2,400 lb) to 622 km (386 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nPSLV-XL\nPSLV-XL is the upgraded version of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in its standard configuration boosted by more powerful, stretched strap-on boosters with 12 tonne propellant load. Weighing 320 t (310 long tons; 350 short tons) at lift-off, the vehicle uses larger strap-on motors (PSOM-XL or S12) to achieve higher payload capability. On 29 December 2005, ISRO successfully tested the improved version of strap-on booster for the PSLV. The first use of PSLV-XL was the launch of Chandrayaan-1 by PSLV-C11. The payload capability for this variant is 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) to Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nPSLV-DL\nPSLV-DL variant has only two strap-on boosters with 12 tonne propellant load on them. PSLV-C44 on 24 January 2019 was the first flight to use PSLV-DL variant of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. It is capable of launching 1,257 kg (2,771 lb) to 600 km (370 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nPSLV-QL\nPSLV-QL variant has four ground-lit strap-on boosters, each with 12 tonnes of propellant. PSLV-C45 on 1 April 2019 was the first flight of PSLV-QL. It has the capacity to launch 1,523 kg (3,358 lb) to 600 km (370 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nPSLV-3S (concept)\nPSLV-3S was conceived as a three-staged version of PSLV with its six strap-on boosters and second liquid stage removed. The total lift-off mass of PSLV-3S was expected to be 175 tonnes with capacity to place 500 kg in 550 km low Earth orbit.\n\nLaunch Profile\nPSLV - XL:\n\nThe PS1 ignites at T+0 providing 4846  kN of thrust.\nWithin T+1, 4 out of the 6 boosters ignite on ground, each producing 703 kN of thrust. 7658 kN of total thrust is produced by the combined propulsion of the PSOMs and the PS1.\nAt around T+23\/26, the remaining 2 unlit boosters are air-lit bringing the rocket at its maximum thrust capacity.\nAt T+1:10, the first 4 ground-lit PSOMs have depleted its propellant and now separates and falls down to the  ocean. The remaining 2 PSOMs and the PS1 continue to burn.\nAt T+1:35, the remaining 2 PSOMs complete its 70 seconds burn and separate, leaving the rocket in a Core- Alone configuration.\nAt T+1:50, the PS1 has completed its 110-second burn and it separates and the Vikas Engine inside the PS2 ignites.\nThe second stage burns for around 130 seconds and around T+4 minutes, the second stages shuts off and separates.\nThe third stage, which is a solid rocket booster, and burns 80 seconds and then coasts for the remainder of time and around T+8\/10 minutes, it separates and the 4th stage ignites to give the rocket a final push into the orbit.\nThis 4th stage burn is highly variable and depends on the mass and number of payloads and usually is around 500 seconds long. The 4th stage may shut off around T+16\/18 minutes followed by the Payload Deployment.\n\nLaunch statistics\nAs of May 22, 2023 the PSLV has made 57 launches, with 54 successfully reaching their planned orbits, two outright failures and one partial failure, yielding a success rate of 94% (or 95% including the partial failure). All launches have occurred from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, known before 2002 as the Sriharikota Range (SHAR).\n\nLaunch system status\n\nDecade-wise summary of PSLV launches:\n\nSee also\nGSLV Mark II\nLVM 3\nComparison of orbital launchers families\nMedium-lift launch vehicle, 2,000 to 20,000 kg to LEO\nComparison of orbital rocket engines\nComparison of orbital launch systems\nPassage 2:\nUSA-214\nUSA-214, also known as Advanced Extremely High Frequency-1 or AEHF-1, is a military communications satellite operated by the United States Air Force. It is the first of six satellites to be launched as part of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency program, which will replace the earlier Milstar system.\n\nSatellite description\nThe USA-214 satellite was constructed by Lockheed Martin Space, and is based on the A2100 satellite bus. The satellite has a mass of 6,168 kg (13,598 lb) and a design life of 14 years. It will be used to provide super high frequency (SHF) and extremely high frequency (EHF) communications for the United States Armed Forces, as well as those of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Canada.\n\nLaunch\nThough initially scheduled for launch on 30 July 2010, delays with the launch vehicle pushed flight back to 10 August 2010, and finally to 14 August 2010.USA-214 was launched by United Launch Alliance, aboard an Atlas V 531 flying from Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). The launch occurred at 11:07:00 UTC on 14 August 2010, and resulted in the satellite being deployed successfully into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 221 km (137 mi), an apogee of 50,179 km (31,180 mi), and 22.2\u00b0 Orbital inclination.\n\nAnomaly\nThe satellite was intended to maneuver from the transfer orbit into which it was launched to its operational geosynchronous orbit by means of a liquid apogee engine (LAE) and several \nHall-effect thrusters, a process which normally takes 105 days. However, the satellite's Liquid Apogee Engine malfunctioned shortly after ignition on both its first burn on 15 August 2010 and a second attempt on 17 August 2010, and it was declared inoperable.To solve the problem, the perigee altitude was raised to 4,700 km (2,900 mi) using twelve firings of the smaller Reaction Engine Assembly thrusters, originally intended for attitude control during LAE maneuvers. From this altitude, the solar arrays were deployed and the orbit was raised toward the operational orbit over the course of nine months using the 0.27 Newton Hall effect thruster, a form of electric propulsion which is highly efficient, but produces very low thrust and is therefore very slow.\nThe problem with the liquid apogee engine was later blamed on a piece of cloth accidentally left in a fuel line leading up to the engine while the line was taken apart for repair during the manufacture of the satellite. The cloth was likely placed in the line to prevent impurities from entering the fuel line and did not get removed when the line was put back together.\n\nSee also\n2010 in spaceflight\nPassage 3:\nCommunications satellite\nA communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications.  Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit 22,300 miles (35,900 km) above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite. Others form satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently.\nThe high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth.  The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points.  Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or \"bands\" certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nIn October 1945, Arthur C. Clarke published an article titled \"Extraterrestrial Relays\" in the British magazine Wireless World. The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary orbits to relay radio signals. Because of this, Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the concept of the communications satellite, and the term 'Clarke Belt' is employed as a description of the orbit.\n\nThe first artificial Earth satellite was Sputnik 1 which was put into orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. It was developed by Mikhail Tikhonravov and Sergey Korolev, building on work by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Sputnik 1 was equipped with an on-board radio transmitter that worked on two frequencies of 20.005 and 40.002 MHz, or 7 and 15 meters wavelength. The satellite was not placed in orbit to send data from one point on Earth to another; the radio transmitter was meant to study the properties of radio wave distribution throughout the ionosphere.  The launch of Sputnik 1 was a major step in the exploration of space and rocket development, and marks the beginning of the Space Age.\n\nEarly active and passive satellite experiments\nThere are two major classes of communications satellites, passive and active. Passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source, toward the direction of the receiver. With passive satellites, the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver.  Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to free-space path loss, so the signal received on Earth is very, very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground. Passive satellites were the first communications satellites, but are little used now.\nWork that was begun in the field of electrical intelligence gathering at the United States Naval Research Laboratory in 1951 led to a project named Communication Moon Relay. Military planners had long shown considerable interest in secure and reliable communications lines as a tactical necessity, and the ultimate goal of this project was the creation of the longest communications circuit in human history, with the moon, Earth's natural satellite, acting as a passive relay. After achieving the first transoceanic communication between Washington, D.C., and Hawaii on 23 January 1956, this system was publicly inaugurated and put into formal production in January 1960.\n\nThe first satellite purpose-built to actively relay communications was Project SCORE,  led by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and launched on 18 December 1958, which used a tape recorder to carry a stored voice message, as well as to receive, store, and retransmit messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The satellite also executed several realtime transmissions before the non-rechargeable batteries failed on 30 December 1958 after eight hours of actual operation.The direct successor to SCORE was another ARPA-led project called Courier. Courier 1B was launched on 4 October 1960 to explore whether it would be possible to establish a global military communications network by using \"delayed repeater\" satellites, which receive and store information until commanded to rebroadcast them. After 17 days, a command system failure ended communications from the satellite.NASA's satellite applications program launched the first artificial satellite used for passive relay communications in Echo 1 on 12 August 1960. Echo 1 was an aluminized balloon satellite acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals. Communication signals were bounced off the satellite from one point on Earth to another. This experiment sought to establish the feasibility of worldwide broadcasts of telephone, radio, and television signals.\n\nMore firsts and further experiments\nTelstar was the first active, direct relay communications commercial satellite and marked the first transatlantic transmission of television signals. Belonging to AT&T as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, Bell Telephone Laboratories, NASA, the British General Post Office, and the French National PTT (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on 10 July 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch.Another passive relay experiment primarily intended for military communications purposes was Project West Ford, which was led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory. After an initial failure in 1961, a launch on 9 May 1963 dispersed 350 million copper needle dipoles to create a passive reflecting belt. Even though only about half of the dipoles properly separated from each other, the project was able to successfully experiment and communicate using frequencies in the SHF X band spectrum.An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was the Hughes Aircraft Company's Syncom 2, launched on 26 July 1963. Syncom 2 was the first communications satellite in a geosynchronous orbit. It revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north\u2013south motion, special equipment was needed to track it. Its successor, Syncom 3, launched on 19 July 1964, was the first geostationary communications satellite. Syncom 3 obtained a geosynchronous orbit, without a north\u2013south motion, making it appear from the ground as a stationary object in the sky.A direct extension of the passive experiments of Project West Ford was the Lincoln Experimental Satellite program, also conducted by the Lincoln Laboratory on behalf of the United States Department of Defense. The LES-1 active communications satellite was launched on 11 February 1965 to explore the feasibility of active solid-state X band long-range military communications. A total of nine satellites were launched between 1965 and 1976 as part of this series.\n\nInternational commercial satellite projects\nIn the United States, 1962 saw the creation of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT) private corporation, which was subject to instruction by the US Government on matters of national policy. Over the next two years, international negotiations led to the Intelsat Agreements, which in turn led to the launch of Intelsat 1, also known as Early Bird, on 6 April 1965, and which was the first commercial communications satellite to be placed in geosynchronous orbit. Subsequent Intelsat launches in the 1960s provided multi-destination service and video, audio, and data service to ships at sea (Intelsat 2 in 1966\u201367), and the completion of a fully global network with Intelsat 3 in 1969\u201370. By the 1980s, with significant expansions in commercial satellite capacity, Intelsat was on its way to become part of the competitive private telecommunications industry, and had started to get competition from the likes of PanAmSat in the United States, which, ironically, was then bought by its archrival in 2005.When Intelsat was launched, the United States was the only launch source outside of the Soviet Union, who did not participate in the Intelsat agreements. The Soviet Union launched its first communications satellite on 23 April 1965 as part of the Molniya program. This program was also unique at the time for its use of what then became known as the Molniya orbit, which describes a highly elliptical orbit, with two high apogees daily over the northern hemisphere. This orbit provides a long dwell time over Russian territory as well as over Canada at higher latitudes than geostationary orbits over the equator.\n\nSatellite orbits\nCommunications satellites usually have one of three primary types of orbit, while other orbital classifications are used to further specify orbital details. MEO and LEO are non-geostationary orbit (NGSO).\n\nGeostationary satellites have a geostationary orbit (GEO), which is 22,236 miles (35,785 km) from Earth's surface. This orbit has the special characteristic that the apparent position of the satellite in the sky when viewed by a ground observer does not change, the satellite appears to \"stand still\" in the sky.  This is because the satellite's orbital period is the same as the rotation rate of the Earth.  The advantage of this orbit is that ground antennas do not have to track the satellite across the sky, they can be fixed to point at the location in the sky the satellite appears.\nMedium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites are closer to Earth. Orbital altitudes range from 2,000 to 36,000 kilometres (1,200 to 22,400 mi) above Earth.\nThe region below medium orbits is referred to as low Earth orbit (LEO), and is about 160 to 2,000 kilometres (99 to 1,243 mi) above Earth.As satellites in MEO and LEO orbit the Earth faster, they do not remain visible in the sky to a fixed point on Earth continually like a geostationary satellite, but appear to a ground observer to cross the sky and \"set\" when they go behind the Earth beyond the visible horizon. Therefore, to provide continuous communications capability with these lower orbits requires a larger number of satellites, so that one of these satellites will always be visible in the sky for transmission of communication signals.  However, due to their closer distance to the Earth, LEO or MEO satellites can communicate to ground with reduced latency and at lower power than would be required from a geosynchronous orbit.\n\nLow Earth orbit (LEO)\nA low Earth orbit (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 160 to 2,000 kilometres (99 to 1,243 mi) above the earth's surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes.Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, many satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.\nLow-Earth-orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, do not require as high signal strength (signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is considerable). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost.\nIn addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.\n\nSatellite constellation\nA group of satellites working in concert is known as a satellite constellation. Two such constellations, intended to provide satellite phone and low-speed data services, primarily to remote areas, are the Iridium and Globalstar systems. The Iridium system has 66 satellites, which orbital inclination of 86.4\u00b0 and inter-satellite links provide service availability over the entire surface of Earth. Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by SpaceX, that aims for global satellite Internet access coverage.\nIt is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low-Earth-orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part.  This will be the case with the CASCADE system of Canada's CASSIOPE communications satellite. Another system using this store and forward method is Orbcomm.\n\nMedium Earth orbit (MEO)\nA medium Earth orbit is a satellite in orbit somewhere between 2,000 and 35,786 kilometres (1,243 and 22,236 mi) above the earth's surface.  MEO satellites are similar to LEO satellites in functionality. MEO satellites are visible for much longer periods of time than LEO satellites, usually between 2 and 8 hours. MEO satellites have a larger coverage area than LEO satellites. A MEO satellite's longer duration of visibility and wider footprint means fewer satellites are needed in a MEO network than a LEO network. One disadvantage is that a MEO satellite's distance gives it a longer time delay and weaker signal than a LEO satellite, although these limitations are not as severe as those of a GEO satellite.\nLike LEOs, these satellites do not maintain a stationary distance from the earth.  This is in contrast to the geostationary orbit, where satellites are always 35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi) from the earth.\nTypically the orbit of a medium earth orbit satellite is about 16,000 kilometres (10,000 mi) above earth. In various patterns, these satellites make the trip around earth in anywhere from 2 to 8 hours.\n\nExamples of MEO\nIn 1962, the communications satellite, Telstar, was launched. It was a medium earth orbit satellite designed to help facilitate high-speed telephone signals. Although it was the first practical way to transmit signals over the horizon, its major drawback was soon realised. Because its orbital period of about 2.5 hours did not match the Earth's rotational period of 24 hours, continuous coverage was impossible. It was apparent that multiple MEOs needed to be used in order to provide continuous coverage.\nIn 2013, the first four of a constellation of 20 MEO satellites was launched. The O3b satellites provide broadband internet services, in particular to remote locations and maritime and in-flight use, and orbit at an altitude of 8,063 kilometres (5,010 mi)).\n\nGeostationary orbit (GEO)\nTo an observer on Earth, a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears motionless, in a fixed position in the sky.  This is because it revolves around the Earth at Earth's own angular velocity (one revolution per sidereal day, in an equatorial orbit).\nA geostationary orbit is useful for communications because ground antennas can be aimed at the satellite without their having to track the satellite's motion. This is relatively inexpensive.\nIn applications that require many ground antennas, such as DirecTV distribution, the savings in ground equipment can more than outweigh the cost and complexity of placing a satellite into orbit.\n\nExamples of GEO\nThe first geostationary satellite was Syncom 3, launched on 19 August 1964, and used for communication across the Pacific starting with television coverage of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Shortly after Syncom 3, Intelsat I, aka Early Bird, was launched on 6 April 1965 and placed in orbit at 28\u00b0 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the Atlantic Ocean.\nOn 9 November 1972, Canada's first geostationary satellite serving the continent, Anik A1, was launched by Telesat Canada, with the United States following suit with the launch of Westar 1 by Western Union on 13 April 1974.\nOn 30 May 1974, the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be three-axis stabilized was launched: the experimental satellite ATS-6 built for NASA.\nAfter the launches of the Telstar through Westar 1 satellites, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now SES) launched Satcom 1 in 1975.  It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early cable TV channels such as WTBS (now TBS), HBO, CBN (now Freeform) and The Weather Channel become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local cable TV headends using the satellite.  Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like ABC, NBC, and CBS, to distribute programming to their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1 was widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24 transponders as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.By 2000, Hughes Space and Communications (now Boeing Satellite Development Center) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include Space Systems\/Loral, Orbital Sciences Corporation with the Star Bus series, Indian Space Research Organisation, Lockheed Martin (owns the former RCA Astro Electronics\/GE Astro Space business), Northrop Grumman, Alcatel Space, now Thales Alenia Space, with the Spacebus series, and Astrium.\n\nMolniya orbit\nGeostationary satellites must operate above the equator and therefore appear lower on the horizon as the receiver gets farther from the equator. This will cause problems for extreme northerly latitudes, affecting connectivity and causing multipath interference (caused by signals reflecting off the ground and into the ground antenna).\nThus, for areas close to the North (and South) Pole, a geostationary satellite may appear below the horizon. Therefore, Molniya orbit satellites have been launched, mainly in Russia, to alleviate this problem.\nMolniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellite's position above the horizon. Thus, a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees.)\nThe Molniya orbit is designed so that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for six to nine hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.\nThe first satellite of the Molniya series was launched on 23 April 1965 and was used for experimental transmission of TV signals from a Moscow uplink station to downlink stations located in Siberia and the Russian Far East, in Norilsk, Khabarovsk, Magadan and Vladivostok. In November 1967 Soviet engineers created a unique system of national TV network of satellite television, called Orbita, that was based on Molniya satellites.\n\nPolar orbit\nIn the United States, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) was established in 1994 to consolidate the polar satellite operations of\nNASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)\nNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). NPOESS manages a number of satellites for various purposes; for example, METSAT for meteorological satellite, EUMETSAT for the European branch of the program, and METOP for meteorological operations.\nThese orbits are sun synchronous, meaning that they cross the equator at the same local time each day. For example, the satellites in the NPOESS (civilian) orbit will cross the equator, going from south to north, at times 1:30 P.M., 5:30 P.M., and 9:30 P.M.\n\nBeyond geostationary orbit\nThere are plans and initiatives to bring dedicated communications satellite beyond geostationary orbits.\nNASA proposed LunaNet as a data network aiming to provide a \u201eLunar Internet for cis-lunar spacecraft and Installations.\nThe Moonlight Initiative is an equivalent ESA project that is stated to be compatible and providing navigational services for the lunar surface. Both programmes are satellite constellstions of several satellites in various orbits around the Moon.\nOther orbits are also planned to be used. Positions in the Earth-Moon-Libration points are also proposed for communication satellites covering the Moon alike communication satellites in geosynchronous orbit cover the Earth. Also, dedicated communication satellites in orbits around Mars supporting different missions on surface and other orbits are considered, such as the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter.\n\nStructure\nCommunications Satellites are usually composed of the following subsystems:\n\nCommunication Payload, normally composed of transponders, antennas, and switching systems\nEngines used to bring the satellite to its desired orbit\nA station keeping tracking and stabilization subsystem used to keep the satellite in the right orbit, with its antennas pointed in the right direction, and its power system pointed towards the sun\nPower subsystem, used to power the Satellite systems, normally composed of solar cells, and batteries that maintain power during solar eclipse\nCommand and Control subsystem, which maintains communications with ground control stations. The ground control Earth stations monitor the satellite performance and control its functionality during various phases of its life-cycle.The bandwidth available from a satellite depends upon the number of transponders provided by the satellite. Each service (TV, Voice, Internet, radio) requires a different amount of bandwidth for transmission. This is typically known as link budgeting and a network simulator can be used to arrive at the exact value.\n\nFrequency allocation for satellite systems\nAllocating frequencies to satellite services is a complicated process which requires international coordination and planning. This is carried out under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).\nTo facilitate frequency planning, the world is divided into three regions:\n\nRegion 1: Europe, Africa, the Middle East, what was formerly the Soviet Union, and Mongolia\nRegion 2: North and South America and Greenland\nRegion 3: Asia (excluding region 1 areas), Australia, and the southwest PacificWithin these regions, frequency bands are allocated to various satellite services, although a given service may be allocated different frequency bands in different regions. Some of the services provided by satellites are:\n\nFixed satellite service (FSS)\nBroadcasting satellite service (BSS)\nMobile-satellite service\nRadionavigation-satellite service\nMeteorological-satellite service\n\nApplications\nTelephony\nThe first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental long distance telephony. The fixed Public Switched Telephone Network relays telephone calls from land line telephones to an earth station, where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite.  The downlink follows an analogous path.  Improvements in submarine communications cables through the use of fiber-optics caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century.\nSatellite communications are still used in many applications today. Remote islands such as Ascension Island, Saint Helena, Diego Garcia, and Easter Island, where no submarine cables are in service, need satellite telephones. There are also regions of some continents and countries where landline telecommunications are rare to non existent, for example large regions of South America, Africa, Canada, China, Russia, and Australia. Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of Antarctica and Greenland. Other land use for satellite phones are rigs at sea, a backup for hospitals, military, and recreation. Ships at sea, as well as planes, often use satellite phones.Satellite phone systems can be accomplished by a number of means. On a large scale, often there will be a local telephone system in an isolated area with a link to the telephone system in a main land area. There are also services that will patch a radio signal to a telephone system. In this example, almost any type of satellite can be used. Satellite phones connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-Earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite teleport connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network .\n\nTelevision\nAs television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large bandwidth to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats.  Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct broadcast satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS).\nThe definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the Astra, Eutelsat, and Hotbird spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.\nFixed Service Satellites use the C band, and the lower portions of the Ku band. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming, live shots, and backhauls), as well as being used for distance learning by schools and universities, business television (BTV), Videoconferencing, and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to cable television headends.\nFree-to-air satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the Ku band. The Intelsat Americas 5, Galaxy 10R and AMC 3 satellites over North America provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their Ku band transponders.\nThe American Dish Network DBS service has also recently used FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their SuperDish antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the FCC's \"must-carry\" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry HDTV channels.\nA direct broadcast satellite is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave Ku band. DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented (Direct-To-Home) satellite TV services, such as DirecTV, DISH Network and Orby TV in the United States, Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct in Canada, Freesat and Sky in the UK, Ireland, and New Zealand and DSTV in South Africa.\nOperating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5 m) in diameter for Ku band, and 12 feet (3.6 m) or larger for C band).  They use linear polarization for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to circular polarization used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users do not notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of TVRO (Television Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its Ku band form for the now-defunct Primestar satellite TV service.\nSome satellites have been launched that have transponders in the Ka band, such as DirecTV's SPACEWAY-1 satellite, and Anik F2. NASA and ISRO have also launched experimental satellites carrying Ka band beacons recently.Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (on which the antenna is mounted) is situated.  These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some recreational vehicle owners.  Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by JetBlue Airways for DirecTV (supplied by LiveTV, a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.\n\nRadio broadcasting\nSatellite radio offers audio broadcast services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.\nA satellite radio or subscription radio (SR) is a digital radio signal that is broadcast by a communications satellite, which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio signals.\n\nAmateur radio\nAmateur radio operators have access to amateur satellites, which have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne repeaters, and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with UHF or VHF radio equipment and highly directional antennas such as Yagis or dish antennas. Due to launch costs, most current amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the X.25 or similar protocols.\n\nInternet access\nAfter the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the Internet via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in remote areas, and cannot access a broadband connection, or require high availability of services.\n\nMilitary\nCommunications satellites are used for military communications applications, such as Global Command and Control Systems. Examples of military systems that use communication satellites are the MILSTAR, the DSCS, and the FLTSATCOM of the United States, NATO satellites, United Kingdom satellites (for instance Skynet), and satellites of the former Soviet Union. India has launched its first Military Communication satellite GSAT-7, its transponders operate in UHF, F, C and Ku band bands. Typically military satellites operate in the UHF, SHF (also known as X-band) or EHF (also known as Ka band) frequency bands.\n\nData collection\nNear-ground in situ environmental monitoring equipment (such as weather stations, weather buoys, and radiosondes), may use satellites for one-way data transmission or two-way telemetry and telecontrol. It may be based on a secondary payload of a weather satellite (as in the case of GOES and METEOSAT and others in the Argos system) or in dedicated satellites (such as SCD). The data rate is typically much lower than in satellite Internet access.\n\nSee also\nPassage 4:\nATS-6\nATS-6 (Applications Technology Satellite-6)  was a NASA experimental satellite, built by Fairchild Space and Electronics Division It has been called the world's first educational satellite as well as world's first experimental Direct Broadcast Satellite as part of the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment between NASA and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was launched May 30, 1974, and decommissioned July 1979. At the time of launch, it was the most powerful telecommunication satellite in orbit. ATS-6 carried no fewer than 23 different experiments, and introduced several breakthroughs. It was the first 3-axis stabilized spacecraft in geostationary orbit. It was also the first to use experimentally with some success electric propulsion in geostationary orbit. It also carried several particle physics experiments, including the first heavy ion detector in geostationary orbit.\nDuring its five-year life, ATS-6 transmitted connection programming to various countries, including India, the United States and other regions. The vehicle also conducted air traffic control tests, was used to practice satellite-assisted search and rescue techniques, carried an experimental radiometer subsequently carried as a standard instrument aboard weather satellites, and pioneered direct broadcast TV.\nATS-6 was a precursor to many technologies still in use today on geostationary spacecraft: large deployable antenna, 3-axis attitude control with slewing capabilities, antenna pointing through RF sensing, electric propulsion, meteorological radiometer in geostationary orbit, and direct to home broadcasting. It is also possible that ATS-6 was a forerunner of the large ELINT satellites such as Mentor.\n\nLaunch\nATS-6 was launched on May 30, 1974, by a Titan III-C launch vehicle. The spacecraft was inserted directly in the geosynchronous orbit. This reduced the on-board fuel requirements to less than 40 kilograms (88 lb) (for a total mass at launch of nearly 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb)). The highly accurate orbit insertion further lowered the amount of fuel required for final positioning to 9 kilograms (20 lb). This enabled a life extension from the original 2 year to 5 years, even accounting for the premature failure of the electric propulsion subsystem (the station-keeping fuel requirement being around 1.6 kilograms per year (3.5 lb\/a)).\n\nStructure, power subsystem and antenna\nOne of the major innovations of ATS-6 was an in-flight deployable antenna of more than 9 metres (30 ft) in diameter. The antenna reflector was furled during launch under the launch vehicle fairing, and was deployed in orbit much like an umbrella. The antenna reflector was built from 48 aluminum ribs, supporting a metallized Dacron mesh. The antenna feeds (in C, S, L, UHF and VHF bands) were placed on the spacecraft body, facing the antenna reflector, and linked to the antenna and the solar panels masts by a carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) truss. The solar panels were rigidly mounted on two deployable masts. They were of hemi-cylinder shape, thus providing a relatively constant power (595 W beginning of life). Electric power was supplied during eclipses by two Nickel cadmium batteries of 15-A\u00b7h capacity, powering a regulated 30.5-V bus. The satellite dimensions in orbit were 15.8-metre (52 ft) width by 8.2-metre (27 ft) height.\nThis deployable antenna parabola was designed and developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC), now Lockheed Martin, under subcontract to Fairchild Aerospace, after several years of small study contracts at LMSC.  The program manager at LMSC was GKC (Colin) Campbell.  The deployment of the reflector was initiated by pyrotechnically operated SQUIB cable cutters.  Deployment time was on the order of 2.5 seconds producing 3,400 newton-metres (2,500 lb\u22c5ft) of torque at the spacecraft interface.  The reflector surface was designed for optimal operation at S-Band frequencies. It weighed 83 kilograms (182 lb) at launch and stowed into a toroidal volume (doughnut shaped) approximately 1.8 metres (6 ft) in diameter and 250 millimetres (10 in) thick.  Three models were fabricated, the STM or structural test model, the F reflector and the G reflector.  The STM was destroyed by Fairchild shortly after the program was finished and the F model was launched with the spacecraft in 1972.  The G model sat unprotected in the Farchild parking lot for several years before it was donated to the Smithsonian.  Bill Wade, the assistant program manager and test manager on the program supported The Smithsonian in the restoration by providing a complete set of drawings and specifications and visited the Silver Hill facility to provide technical guidance.At the time of launch it was the largest parabolic surface launched into orbit.\n\nThree-axis stabilisation\nATS-6 has been the first geostationary satellite with three-axis stabilization and pointing., This subsystem was capable of a highly accurate pointing (better than 0.1\u00b0 through the inertial measurement units, down to 0.002\u00b0 by using a radio-frequency interferometer.). Furthermore, the satellite was able to follow low earth orbit satellites through slewing, by tracking the low earth-orbit satellite through an S-band RF sensing. The system was also able to perform orbitography of the tracked satellite, and was a precursor to the operational system TDRSS.\nThis highly advanced (for the time) pointing subsystem used earth and sun sensors, a star tracker pointed to the pole star, Polaris, and three inertial sensors. The sensor measurements were fed to two digital computers (nominal and redundant), as well to a back-up analog computer. It was also possible to orient the satellite by using radio-frequency sensors.  Actuators were three momentum wheels, and hot gas (hydrazine mono-propellant) thrusters. One of the momentum wheels having failed in July 1975, an alternative scheme was developed, allowing station-keeping with the two remaining wheels and thrusters.\n\nElectric propulsion\nATS-6 was equipped with two electric thrusters based on the acceleration of cesium ions, that were to be used for North-South Station Keeping. This subsystem development followed earlier failed attempts on the previous ATS spacecraft. Each of the thrusters had a mass of 16 kilograms (35 lb), used 150 W of electric power, and produced a thrust of 4 newton-metres (3.0 lbf\u22c5ft), with a specific impulse of 2500s. The on-board supply of cesium would have been sufficient for 4400 hours of thrust. Unfortunately, both thrusters failed prematurely, one after 1 hour of operation, one after 95 hours. However, some of the experiments objectives could be met, such as the measurement of the effective thrust, the absence of any interference with the radio-frequency payloads (from 150 MHz to 6 GHz), no cesium redeposition on the critical parts of the payload (such as the radiometer), and the correct neutralisation of the spacecraft versus its environment.\n\nPayload\nRadiometer\nA radiometer was on board ATS-6, mounted on the earth-facing panel. This instrument was (for the time) of very high resolution. It operated on two channels: infra-red (10.5 to 12.5 \u00b5m) and visible light (0.55 to 0.75 \u00b5m). Images taken with the radiometer covered the whole earth disk, with a resolution of 1,200 lines of 2,400 pixels each (11-kilometre (6.8 mi) square pixel in infra-red, and 5.5-kilometre (3.4 mi) square in visible light). The IR detector was passively cooled at 115K, and the visible light detector maintained at 300K. A complete image of earth's disk was transmitted to ground every 25 minutes. Several hundreds images were taken and transmitted, until a mechanical component of the radiometer failed, two and a half months after launch.\n\nTelecommunication experiments\nThe main mission of ATS-6 was to demonstrate the feasibility of direct-to-home (DTH) television broadcasting. To this end, in addition to the high-gain antenna, the spacecraft payload was able to receive in any of the VHF, C, S and L-bands, and to transmit in S-band (2 GHz) through a 20-W solid state transmitter, in L-band (1650 MHz) at 40W, in UHF (860 MHz) at 80W (which was used for the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE)), and with a TWTA-based transmitter of 20 W in C-band (4 GHz). The antenna produced two spots on earth of 400,000 square kilometres (150,000 sq mi) each, in which the TV broadcast could be received with 3 metres (9.8 ft) diameter antennas. This payload was first used over the United States for tele-education and tele-medicine experiments, from August 1974 to May 1975 as part of the HET, or Health, Education, Telecommunications experiment developed jointly by NASA and the US Department of Health, Education, & Welfare (now DHHS). The spacecraft was then moved over the geo-stationary arc from 94 \u00b0W to 35 \u00b0E, in collaboration with the Indian Space Agency (ISRO), who had deployed in India more than 2500 receive ground stations. The move of the satellite from 94 degrees West to 35 degrees East, a journey of 12,800 kilometres (8,000 mi), was actioned from the ground station at Rosman North Carolina  This relocation involved 2 rocket burns of the onboard rocket motor. The 2nd burn lasting 5 hours 37 minutes and 17 seconds. The longest burn ever done by a chemical rocket in space at that time. A tele-education programme was started \u2013 Satellite Instructional Television Experiment or SITE \u2013 and run for one year. During the experiment, a receive station was offered by the Indian Government to Arthur C. Clarke, who was living in Sri Lanka. This experiment was highly successful, and encouraged ISRO to start building an operational program, with the Indian spacecraft  INSAT IB (launched 1983). After the SITE experiment, the satellite was brought back over the United States, and served notably as a data-relay and tracking satellite for low-orbit spacecraft such as Nimbus 6, and for the Apollo-Soyuz flight.\n\nParticle physics experiments\nSeveral particle physics experiments were on board ATS-6. The most significant measured low energy protons (from 25 keV to 3.6 MeV), as well as detected heavy ions (up to 6 MeV). This latter experiment allowed to detect the first heavy ions (Z > 6) with an energy  E > 4 MeV, in geostationary orbit.\n\nPropagation experiments\nFinally, ATS-6 embarked several radio beacons, which allowed to measure electromagnetic propagation properties of the atmosphere at 13, 18, 20 and 30 GHz.\n\nDecommissioning\nBy June 30, 1979, only one of the four ATS-6 station keeping thrusters was working, and was showing signs of unreliability. This thruster was used to move ATS-6 out of geostationary orbit to an orbit several hundred kilometers higher. This was to vacate the geostationary slot for the next satellite.\n\nSee also\n1974 in spaceflight\nApplications Technology Satellite\nPassage 5:\nFedSat\nFedSat (Australia's 'Federation Satellite'; sometimes FedSat 1; COSPAR 2002-056B, SATCAT 27598) was an Australian scientific research satellite launched from Tanegashima Space Center, Japan by a NASDA H-IIA launch vehicle  on 14 December 2002 (NASDA is now merged with JAXA). The satellite was developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for Satellite Systems, a cooperative made up of several universities, commercial organisations and government bodies. The ground station was at the Institute for Telecommunications Research, part of the University of South Australia, near Adelaide. Since 2005 it was operated by the Australian Department of Defence.\n\nPayloads\nThe satellite had six payloads, as given below:\n\nCommunications Payload: A collection of three components (UHF transponder, Ka-band transponder and base-band processor) used to perform several experiments in satellite communications.\nHigh Performance Computing Experiment: A reconfigurable computer based on a Xilinx XQR4062 FPGA, the first of its kind to be used in space.\nGPS Payload: A Global Positioning System receiver built by NASA. Conceived especially for ionospheric studies between GPS constellation levels and FedSat orbit.\nNewMag Payload: A magnetometer built by the University of Newcastle, Australia, used to take measurements of the Earth's magnetic field near its poles.\nStar Camera: An experimental star camera built by the University of Stellenbosch, used to determine the position of the satellite in space by analysing images of surrounding stars.\nCompact Disk: A nickel \"master\" disk \"cultural time capsule\" with tracks including Paul Kelly's performance of the song he co-wrote with Kev Carmody, \"From Little Things, Big Things Grow\", and recorded statements from several hundred Australian school children about how they imagined a future Australia and its place in the Asia-Pacific.The satellite platform, comprising the structural\/thermal components, power system, attitude control system, onboard computer and groundlink, was originally developed in the United Kingdom by Space Innovations Limited. It was later completed along with integration of payloads in Canberra, Australia.\n\nDeclared Dead\nThe spacecraft's battery failed in May 2007 and the mission has been terminated, after lasting 18 months longer than expected.\nPassage 6:\nNOAA-4\nNOAA-4, also known as ITOS-G was a weather satellite operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It was part of a series of satellites called ITOS, or improved TIROS. NOAA-4 was launched on a Delta rocket on November 15, 1974. The launch carried two other satellites: AMSAT-OSCAR 7 and Intasat. It remained operational for 1463 days until it was deactivated by NOAA on November 18, 1978.\nPassage 7:\nHans K. Ziegler\nHans K. Ziegler (March 1, 1911, Munich, Germany \u2013 December 11, 1999 Colts Neck Township, New Jersey, United States) was a pioneer in the field of communication satellites and the use of photovoltaic solar cells as a power source for satellites.\n\nLife\nHans Ziegler was born in Munich, Germany. There, he studied at the Technische Hochschule, which is today the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM), and began his career as Wissenschaftlicher Assistant (Scientific Assistant). Following that, he was a researcher in German industry for ten years. During the Second World War, he worked for the company Rosental Selb in Bavaria on high tension porcelain.\nIn 1947, he came to the US with Wernher von Braun under Operation Paperclip, by means of which the USA gained Nazi engineers and scientists. He went to the US Army Signal Corps' Laboratories in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and became a US citizen in 1954.\nZiegler's work in the US was very influential in the development of military electronics, especially in the electronics for the early phases of the US space program. During the thirty years he worked as an engineer in the field of electronics and electrical engineering in the research and development department of the U.S. Army in Fort Monmouth, N.J. (from 1947 to 1976), he held the top position of Chief Scientist for 12 years. In Fort Monmouth, he worked as a Scientific Consultant, Assistant Director of Research, Director of the Astro-Electronics Division and Chief Scientist (1959). After the Army was restructured, he became Deputy for Science and Chief Scientist of the US Army Electronics Command in 1963 and Director of the US Army Electronics Technology & Devices Laboratory from 1971 until his retirement.\nIn May 1954, after examining the solar cells of Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson at Bell Laboratories, Ziegler wrote, \"Future development [of the silicon solar cell] may well render it into an important source of electrical power [as] the roofs of all our buildings in cities and towns equipped with solar [cells] would be sufficient to produce this country's entire demand for electrical power.\"Referring to silicon solar cells, he said to the head of the U. S. Signal Corps, General James O'Connell, at a meeting in September 1955, \"In fact, in the long run, mankind has no choice but to turn to the sun if it wants to survive.\"He and his team produced a report on the prospects for application of this technique in the field of communication and they named the supply of energy for artificial satellites as the most important application. He knew that he was not the first to suggest this application. For example, the science fiction author, Arthur C. Clarke had already made this suggestion in 1945, but without having a concrete technology for it at that time.\nZiegler participated in the development of the first planned satellites. The first satellite,\nExplorer 1, still went into space without solar cells, since it was a quick, less-than-ideal solution after the start of the Sputnik to show the American public that America's scientists could also start a satellite. The actual scheduled satellite project, Project Vanguard, successfully put a satellite named Vanguard I in orbit around Earth on March 17, 1958.\nOver the objections of the Navy, which still thought that solar cells were not a mature technology, this satellite had four solar cells on its outer hull, due to the persistent work of Ziegler, which powered the instruments and performed their duties reliably for more than seven years. After this success, solar cells were established as the energy supply for satellites. He was also involved with the development of the first communication satellite in the world, SCORE, which was started in 1958.\nHe was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award by the US Department of Defense in 1963 as a \" world pioneer in communications satellites and solar energy systems to power satellites\". When he retired in 1977, he was decorated with the highest award of the Army for \"exceptional civilian service\".\nZiegler was the author of many technical papers, a member of the IEEE, and represented the US, in military and civilian matters, in many national and international committees. In 1958, he was a member of the US delegation to the International Geophysical Year in Moscow, USSR, and in 1964, he gave advice on the scientific activities in Antarctica and at the South Pole, under the direction of the US National Science Foundation.\nZiegler's wife Friederike died in 1996. He last lived in Colts Neck Township, New Jersey and died at the age of 88 on December 11, 1999. He was survived by his daughters, Christine Griffith and Friederike Meindl, and his son, Hans.\n\nSee also\nSolar power\nSolar panel\nActive solar\nPhotovoltaic components, projects and howtos\nPassage 8:\nTDRS-6\nTDRS-6, known before launch as TDRS-F, is an American communications satellite, of first generation, which is operated by NASA as part of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. It was constructed by TRW, and is based on a custom satellite bus which was used for all seven first generation TDRS satellites.\n\nHistory\nTDRS-F was deployed from Space Shuttle Endeavour during the STS-54 mission in 1993. Endeavour was launched from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center, at 13:59:30 UTC on 13 January 1993. TDRS-F was deployed from Endeavour around six hours after launch, and was raised to geosynchronous orbit by means of an Inertial Upper Stage.\n\nDeployment\nThe two-stage solid-propellent Inertial Upper Stage made two burns. The first stage burn occurred shortly after deployment from Endeavour, and placed the satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). At 02:26 UTC on 14 January 1993, it reached apogee, and the second stage fired, placing TDRS-F into geosynchronous orbit. At this point, it received its operational designation, TDRS-6.\n\nOperation\nIn 1994, it was placed at a longitude 46.0\u00b0 West of the Greenwich Meridian, to serve as an on-orbit spare. In 1996, it was moved to 47.0\u00b0 West, where it remained until 2005, when it was repositioned to 174.0\u00b0 West, where, as of August 2009, it was used to provide communications with spacecraft in Earth orbit, such as the International Space Station (ISS) and spacecraft bringing astronauts to the ISS.\n\nSee also\nList of TDRS satellites\nPassage 9:\nGSAT-7\nGSAT-7 or INSAT-4F is a multi-band military communications satellite developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation. The Indian Navy is the user of the multi-band communication spacecraft, which has been operational since September 2013. According to defense experts, the satellite will enable the navy to extend its blue water capabilities and stop relying on foreign satellites like Inmarsat, which provide communication services to its ships.\n\nSatellite\nGSAT-7, the multi-band communication satellite named Rukmini carries the payloads in UHF, C band and Ku band. It is the first dedicated military communication satellite (unlike earlier dual use satellites) built by ISRO that will provide services to the Indian Armed Forces with the main user being the Indian Navy. Its procured launch cost has been put at \u20b9480 crore, with the satellite costing \u20b9185 crore.

Our approach is based on applying an optimal \"denoiser\" after the action of a noisy circuit and can be performed with an arbitrary number of extra gates.\nThe denoiser is given by an ensemble of circuits distributed with a quasiprobability distribution. For a simple noise model, we show that efficient, local denoisers can be found, and we demonstrate their effectiveness for the digital quantum simulation of the time evolution of simple spin chains. Introduction.\n-Quantum information processing has been theoretically shown to hold great promises, and quantum algorithms were developed which can in principle achieve an exponential speed-up over their classical counterparts, both for general purpose computing and quantum simulation . However, present day quantum computing prototypes still suffer from significant noise processes which hinder the execution of many potentially groundbreaking quantum algorithms .\nNontrivial quantum algorithms typically require large sequences of quantum gates, each of which introduces dissipation and hence an overall loss of coherence, eventually rendering the results useless. Until quantum error correction becomes practical, quantum error mitigation seems to be more feasible to increase the accuracy of expectation values.\nHere the goal is to induce the (partial) cancellation of errors that stem from noisy quantum gates by extending the circuit corresponding to the desired algorithm with an ensemble of gates , sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. The traditional way to accomplish this is with the gatewise method from , where noise is mitigated by inverting the noise channel of each gate separately, i.e. the cancellation of errors is performed for each gate on its own.\nHere the local noise channel is approximated in a way such that it can be easily inverted analytically, e.g. using Pauli twirling . Gates are then sampled from the inverted noise channel by interpreting it as a quasiprobability distribution. Because in this gate-wise approach every noisy gate has to be modified separately, the sign problem is exponentially large in the number of gates, limiting the practicality of the mitigation.\nThe success of the gate-wise approach resulted in a large body of work concerning these methods , including extensions for simultaneous mitigation of multiple gates by Pauli-twirling entire layers or variationally constructing a mitigating matrix product operator . In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate.\nThese propagated errors * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de \u2248 C\n\nC\n\nFIG. 1. An example of the quantum error mitigation procedure used in this work for the time evolution of the wave function of a spin chain. The ideal second-order Trotter supercircuit C of depth Mtrot = 1 (light blue) is approximated by applying a denoiser D of depth M = 1 (red) to the noisy Trotter supercircuit C (dark blue).\nBecause the denoiser is applied after fully executing the noisy Trotter supercircuit, it represents an approximate inverse of the global noise channel with a precision tunable by the depth of the denoiser. can potentially blow up and lead to large errors for the circuit as a whole . Here we introduce a mitigation technique that takes into account the propagation of errors, can be performed with a tunable number of extra gates, and works for non-Clifford local noise channels since the inversion of the accumulated global noise channel is implicit.\nWe first execute the targeted noisy circuit completely, letting the noise propagate and accumulate, and only afterwards we apply an extra random circuit sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel.\nEssentially, the denoiser inverts a global noise channel. Since we will construct it as a local brickwall circuit, following the classical preprocessing approach from , we call this compressed quantum error mitigation. Method. -Due to the inevitable coupling of a quantum processor to its environment, every qubit operation is affected by noise.\nTherefore, the simplest technique to minimize the impact of the resulting noise is to minimize the number of operations when performing a quantum algorithm. In we showed that many-body time evolution operators can be efficiently compressed into brick-wall circuits with high fidelity per gate. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels, corresponding to completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps .\nFor example, instead of a noiseless two-qubit gate G, which acts on a quantum state |\u03c1 in superoperator form as G|\u03c1 = G\u2297G * |\u03c1 , we get the noisy channel G = N G, where the noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise . These channels are used to construct a \"supercircuit\" C = N G i=1 Gi , consisting of N G channels, which is affected by multi-qubit accumulated noise.\nThis supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits . For simplicity, we assume that the noisy channels Gi in each half brickwall layer are lattice inversion and translation invariant, such that we can construct a denoiser with these properties, limiting the number of variational parameters. The purpose of quantum error mitigation is to modify the ensemble of circuits described by C in a way that we can use it to obtain the noiseless expectation values.\nIn superoperator language, we do this by following the supercircuit C with a denoiser supercircuit D, such that D C is as close to the noiseless supercircuit C = C \u2297 C * as possible. Here C is the target unitary circuit. Because the noise channel N is non-unitary, hence making the supercircuit C non-unitary, we need to use a non-unitary denoiser to retrieve the unitary C.\nWe illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig. , where a denoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with one layer. This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision , and we will use it to benchmark the denoiser.\nIn practice, we cannot directly implement a supercircuit, and so we have to utilize its interpretation as an ensemble of circuits. Essentially, after executing a shot of the noisy circuit we sample the denoiser and apply it. The goal is to construct the denoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulated errors and gives us a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values.\nIt should be noted that our approach requires more gate applications on the quantum processor than with the gate-wise scheme, since there each sample from the mitigation quasiprobability distribution can be absorbed into the original circuit, whereas our approach increases the circuit depth. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoiser.\nFurthermore, within our scheme, the dimensionality of the quasiprobabilistic mitigating ensemble can be controlled, in contrast to the gate-wise approach where it is equal to the gate count. To facilitate the stochastic interpretation we parameterize each two-qubit denoiser channel G i as a sum of CPTP maps, such that we can sample the terms in this sum and execute the sampled gate on the quantum processor.\nConcretely, we use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. For the unitary part we take a two-qubit unitary channel U( \u03c6 i ) = U ( \u03c6 i ) \u2297 U * ( \u03c6 i ), with U ( \u03c6 i ) a two-qubit unitary gate parameterized by \u03c6 i . For this we take the two-qubit ZZ rotation exp(\u2212i\u03b1(\u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 z )) with angle \u03b1, which can be obtained from native gates on current hardware , and dress it with four general one-qubit unitaries, only two of which are independent if we want a circuit that is space inversion symmetric around every bond.\nThe resulting gate has 7 real parameters \u03c6 i . For the non-unitary part, which is essential because D has to cancel the non-unitary accumulated noise to obtain the noiseless unitary circuit, we use a general onequbit measurement followed by conditional preparation channel M( , with V a general one-qubit unitary and each \u03ba i a 3-dimensional vector, resulting in a real 9-dimensional \u03b6 i .\nThis yields the two-qubit correlated measurement M( With these parts we construct the parameterization with coefficients \u03b7 i \u2208 R that satisfy \u03b7 0 + \u03b7 1 = 1 because G i is trace preserving. Note that here the tensor product symbol corresponds to combining two one-qubit channels to make a two-qubit channel, whereas in most of the paper it is used to link the column and row indices of a density matrix.\nWe construct the denoiser from the noisy channels Gi = N G i . With this parameterization one denoiser channel has 17 independent real parameters, such that a denoiser of depth M , i.e. consisting of M brickwall layers, has 34M real parameters (we use one unique channel per half brickwall layer). For reference, a general channel has 544M parameters.\nTo determine the mitigated expectation values we use the full expression where |\u03c1 0 is the initial state and |1 is the vectorized identity operator on the full Hilbert space. To evaluate this on a quantum processor, we use the stochastic interpretation of (1) to resample . In particular, from each channel (1) we get a unitary with probability p 0 = |\u03b7 0 |\/\u03b3 and a measurement followed by conditional preparation with probability p 1 = |\u03b7 1 |\/\u03b3.\nHere \u03b3 = |\u03b7 0 | + |\u03b7 1 | is the sampling overhead, which characterizes the magnitude of the sign problem from negative \u03b7 i . For quasiprobability distributions, i.e. with \u03b3 > 1, every denoiser sample has an extra sign sgn(\u03b7) = N G g=1 sgn(\u03b7 g ), 2. The normalized distance between the denoised Trotter supercircuit D C and the noiseless Trotter supercircuit C (top panels), at evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and the twopoint z-spin correlator C zz i=L\/2,j=L\/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t (bottom panels), for the infinite temperature initial state.\nWe consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. In the top panels we use a Heisenberg chain with L = 8, and in the bottom panels with L = 14, both with periodic boundary conditions. All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01.\nThe non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(\u03b7 g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. \u03b3 = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables \u00d4 p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble\nwhere \u03b3 = N G g=1 \u03b3 g is the overall sampling overhead, with \u03b3 g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large \u03b3 implies a large variance of \u00d4 p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate \u00d4 p=0 with error \u03b4 at probability 1 \u2212 \u03c9 is bounded by (2\u03b3 2 \/\u03b4 2 ) ln(2\/\u03c9) .\nSince \u03b3 scales exponentially in \u03b3 g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and \u03b3 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with \u03b3 > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to \u03b3 = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser.\nSimply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize \u03b3 to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps.\nThis is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the \u03b7 i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits\nwhich bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising. We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from . Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel and subsequently inverting it, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the denoised supercircuit D C, effectively yielding a circuit representation D of the inverse noise channel.\nResults. -To benchmark the denoiser we apply it to the second-order Trotter circuits of the spin-1\/2 Heisenberg chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) where is the Pauli algebra acting on the local Hilbert space of site i. A second-order Trotter circuit for evolution time t with depth M trot consists of M trot \u2212 1 half brickwall layers with time step t\/M trot and two layers with half time step .\nWe consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise.\nWe study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and denoisers D with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the top panels of Fig. we show (4) for a chain of size L = 8 as a function of time t. Here it can be seen that even for M trot = 32 a denoiser with M = 1 already improves by roughly an order of magnitude at all considered t.\nDepending on M trot and t, further increasing M lowers , with the biggest improvements occurring for high precision Trotter circuits with large depth M trot = 64 and short time t = 0.5, where the Trotter gates are closer to the identity than in the other cases. At the other extreme, for M trot = 16 the improvements are relatively small upon increasing M > 2. In all cases the denoiser works better at early times than at late times, again indicating that it is easier to denoise Trotter gates that are relatively close to the identity.\nTo probe the accuracy of the denoiser on quantities that do not enter the optimization, as a first test we consider the two-point correlator between spins at different times where we have chosen the infinite temperature initial state, and C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In the bottom panels of Fig. we show C zz i=L\/2,j=L\/2 (t) for the supercircuits from the upper panels, now for a L = 14 chain.\nHere we see that at M trot = 16 we can retrieve the noiseless values already with M = 1, but that increasing M trot makes this more difficult. At M trot = 64 we see larger deviations, and improvement upon increasing M is less stable, but nonetheless we are able to mitigate errors to a large extent. As a further test, we compute the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) ]\nIn Fig. we show the results for i = L\/2, for a Trotter circuit with depth M trot = 32 and a denoiser with depth M = 2. Here we see that a denoiser with M M trot is able to recover the light-cone of correlations, which are otherwise buried by the noise. In the Supplementary Material we consider how the denoiser performs at different noise levels p, and how the denoised supercircuits perform under stacking.\nThere we also calculate domain wall magnetization dynamics, and show the distribution of the optimized denoiser parameters and the sampling overhead associated to the denoiser as a whole. In Fig. we show the eigenvalues of the noisy supercircuits for a noisy second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 at t = 1 (left), the corresponding optimized denoiser with M = 4 (center), and the denoised supercircuit (right).\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb of a unitary supercircuit lie on the unit circle, and in the presence of dissipation they are pushed to the center. We see that the spectrum of the denoiser lies outside the unit circle, making it an unphysical channel which cures the effect of the noise on the circuit, such that the spectrum of the denoised circuit is pushed back to the unit circle.\nThe noiseless eigenvalues are shown as blue bars, making it clear that the denoiser is able to recover the noiseless eigenvalues from the noisy circuit. In the Supplementary Material we show the spectra for a p = 0.036 denoiser, where we observe a clustering of eigenvalues reminiscent of Refs. . There we also investigate the channel entropy of the various supercircuits .\nConclusion. -We have introduced a probabilistic error cancellation scheme, where a classically determined denoiser mitigates the accumulated noise of a (generally non-Clifford) local noise channel. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and the parameterization of the corresponding channels provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation.\nWe have shown that a denoiser with one layer can already significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. This effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from , can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoiser channels.\nIn particu-lar, measurements can have non-local effects, since the measurement of a single qubit can reduce some highly entangled state (e.g. a GHZ state) to a product state, whereas in unitary circuits the spreading of correlations forms a light-cone. To optimize a denoiser with convenience at L > 8, the optimization can be formulated in terms of matrix product operators or channels , which is convenient because the circuit calculations leading to the normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions .\nThis provides one route to a practical denoiser, which is relevant because the targeted noiseless circuit and the accompanying noisy variant in (4) need to be simulated classically, confining the optimization procedure to limited system sizes with an exact treatment or limited entanglement with tensor networks.\nNonetheless, we can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, such that the noiseless and denoised supercircuits in (4) have relatively small entanglement, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states.\nAnalogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size. Both approaches are limited by the light-cone of many-body correlations, as visualized in Fig. , because finite-size effects appear when the light-cone width becomes comparable with system size.\n1. The normalized distance (left) and z spin correlator C zz i=L\/2,j=L\/2 (right), for a second-order Trotter supercircuit of depth Mtrot = 16 for time t = 1, affected by various twoqubit depolarizing errors p. We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0).\nThe denoiser is affected by the same noise as the Trotter circuit. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and we use a L = 8 Heisenberg chain with PBC for the normalized distance, while for the correlator we use L = 14. * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de to observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1.\nFor large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work.\nAs mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1.\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb of the noisy supercircuit C are clustered close to zero, far away from the unit circle (except for \u03bb = 1), showing that the circuit is strongly affected by the noise. To mitigate the impact of the noise, the denoiser consequently has to renormalize the spectrum strongly. If it accurately represents the inverse of the global noise channel, its spectrum has to lie far outside the unit circle, which is the case.\nInterestingly, we observe a clustering of eigenvalues which is reminiscent to the spectra found in . By comparison to these works, we suspect that this is due to the local nature of the denoiser, and warrants further investigation. The right panel of Fig. shows the result of the denoiser, pushing the eigenvalues back to the unit circle, nearly with the exact same distribution along the circle as the noiseless eigenvalues (blue bars).\nDue to the strong noise, this is not achieved perfectly, and it is clear that this cannot work in principle if the global noise channel has a zero eigenvalue. The complexity of an operator can be quantified by its operator entanglement entropy . Here we calculate the half-chain channel entanglement entropy S of the noiseless C, noisy C, denoiser D, and denoised D C supercircuits.\nWe define S as the entanglement entropy of the state that is related to a supercircuit C via the Choi-Jamio lkowski isomorphism, i.e. \u03c8 C = \u03c7 C \/N , where the process matrix \u03c7 ab,cd C = C ac,bd is simply a reshaped supercircuit and N ensures normalization. Then we have S = \u2212Tr [\u03c8 C ln \u03c8 C ]. This entropy measure is a particular instance of the \"exchange entropy\", which characterizes the information exchange between a quantum system and its environment .\nIn Fig. we plot the various S for a second-order Trotter circuit with M trot = 16 at t = 2, for a denoiser with M = 4, both affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p \u2208 [10 \u22123 , 10 \u22121 ]. The Trotter circuit is for a Heisenberg model with L = 6 and PBC. We see that at large p, the noise destroys entanglement in the noisy supercircuit, and that the denoiser S increases to correct for this, such that the denoised supercircuit recovers the noiseless S.\nHere we investigate how denoised supercircuits perform upon repeated application. We optimize the denoiser for a Trotter supercircuit for a fixed evolution time t. Then, to reach later times, we stack the denoised supercircuit n times to approximate the evolution up to time nt: In Fig. we stack a denoised t = 1 supercircuit up to n = 20 times and calculate the correlation function, defined in the main text, for the middle site.\nWe consider Trotter depths M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, for a L = 14 Heisenberg chain with p = 0.01 depolarizing two-qubit noise. The noisy results correspond to M = 0 and the noiseless results to p = 0. In Fig. we calculate the OTOC, defined in the main text, with stacked time evolution for a denoised t = 2 supercircuit with M trot = 32 and M = 2, stacked up to ten times.\nWe see that the stacked supercircuit performs very well, and the additional precision obtained by using deep denoisers (M = 8) pays off for long evolution times, where we see convergence to the exact result (black dashed lines in Fig. ) as a function of M .

The calculations were performed for a periodic Heisenberg model with L = 14 and PBC, affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with strength p = 0.01, which also affects the denoiser. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless results with p = 0.\nThe panels are arranged as Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 for top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, respectively. The costliest and most noise-susceptible operation is the two-qubit ZZ rotation with angle \u03b1, which is the foundation of the unitary piece in our channel parameterization, defined in the main text.\nFor completeness, we here present the \u03b1 angles of the optimized denoisers. The results are shown in Fig. , which contains histograms for the channel count N G versus \u03b1. The histograms are stacked, with the lightest color corresponding to the angles of the denoiser at t = 0.5 and the darkest at t = 5. The top four panels are for a denoiser with M = 2 and the bottom four with M = 8.\nWe consider M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64. We see that in both cases the distribution widens upon increasing M trot , indicating that the unitary channels start deviating more from the identity. Moreover, while the M = 2 denoisers in all cases except M trot = 64 have ZZ contributions close to the identity, this is clearly not the case for M = 8.\nFor simplicity, we did not focus on obtaining denoisers with the smallest sampling overhead \u03b3, which is required to minimize the sign problem and hence ease the sampling of mitigated quantities. Instead, we let the optimization freely choose the \u03b7 i in the denoiser parameterization, as defined in the main text.\nIn Fig. we show the sampling overhead of the denoisers from Fig. of the main text. We see that for M = 1 and M = 2 the sampling overhead is relatively small and uniform across the different t, whereas for M > 2 the optimization sometimes yields a denoiser with large \u03b3 and other times with small \u03b3. This could be related to the difference in \u03b1 distributions from Fig. .\nThe large fluctuations of \u03b3 appears to stem from the difficulty in finding optimal deep denoisers, and our optimization procedure likely only finds a local minimum in these cases. Here C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In Fig. we show Z dw for the circuits from Fig.","label":"longbench","length":7365,"title":"Paper Info"}
{"context":"Passage 1:\nAugust Hirt\nAugust Hirt (28 April 1898 \u2013 2 June 1945) was an anatomist with Swiss and German nationality who served as a chairman at the Reich University in Strasbourg during World War II. He performed experiments with mustard gas on inmates at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp and played a lead role in the murders of 86 people at Natzweiler-Struthof for the Jewish skull collection. The skeletons of his victims were meant to become specimens at the Institute of anatomy in Strasbourg, but completion of the project was stopped by the progress of the war. He was an SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer (captain) and in 1944, an SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer (major).\n\nWorld War I, post-war education and joining the Nazi party\nHirt was the son of a Swiss business man. In 1914, he volunteered, while still a high school student, to fight in World War I on the German side. In October 1916, he was wounded in the upper jaw by a bullet. He received the Iron Cross and returned to Mannheim in 1917. He studied medicine at Heidelberg University. In 1921, he gained German citizenship. In 1922, Hirt obtained his doctorate in medicine with \"Der Grenzstrang des Sympathicus bei einigen Sauriern\" (English: The Ganglions in the Sympathetic Nervous System of Some Lizards). He then worked at the Anatomical Institute in Heidelberg and in 1925 he was authorized to teach thanks to a thesis on nerve cells. In 1930 he became professor at Heidelberg University.\nIn September 1932, Hirt joined the Militant League for German Culture. On 1 April 1933, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS-Nr. 100 414), and was promoted to Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer (captain) on 1 July 1937, but he was only a member of the Nazi Party from 1 May 1937, when he enrolled in the universities of the Reich (Mitgliedsnr. 4012784). From 1 March 1942, he was a member of the personal staff of the RuSHA, the organisation in charge of \"racial and ideological purity\" of the members of the SS. He attained the rank of Sturmbannf\u00fchrer (major) in 1944.\nHirt was married and had a son and a daughter.\n\nWorld War II\nFrom 1 April 1936 Hirt was associate director of the Institute of  anatomy at University of Greifswald. On 1 October 1938, he obtained the same post at Goethe University. At the beginning of the Second World War he was an SS medical chief (from August 1939 to April 1941). During this time the Battle of France took place, resulting in the fall of France and its occupation by German forces, and Hirt participated in the battle. He then became director of the new Institute of anatomy at the Reichsuniversit\u00e4t Stra\u00dfburg.\n\nJewish skeleton collection\nThe Ahnenerbe under the Third Reich was a society that organised \"medical experiments\" on prisoners. Hirt conceived and directed one called the Jewish skeleton collection, which was begun but not completed as intended. He also performed experiments on cadavers and collected human skulls. He was appointed director since 1941 of the Institute of Anatomy in Strasbourg. He wanted to create a collection of skulls of \"Judeo-Bolsheviks\", as part of his research on race. According to him, the Jewish race was on the point of extinction and he wished to gather a collection of them while there was still time. Hirt sent his project to Heinrich Himmler. Hirt wrote of this project: \"There are important collections of skulls of nearly all the races and peoples. Except for the Jews, of which science has so few skulls, so it is not possible to draw any meaningful inferences. The war in the East gives us the opportunity to fill the gap. We have the opportunity to acquire a tangible scientific document by procuring the skulls of Jewish-Bolsheviks who embody the disgusting but characteristic subhuman.\":\u200a882\u200aHirt conceived the project to go beyond a collection of skulls, to a collection of Jewish skeletons and so presented his research plan to Himmler. He approved the project so that Hirt could begin his \"medical experiments.\" Working with the Ahnenerbe division, Wolfram Sievers, Bruno Beger, Hans Fleischhacker and Hirt together collected people from among the Auschwitz inmates in order to create an anatomical specimen collection specifically of Jews. Hirt proposed to use the small-scale gas chamber at Natzweiler-Struthof to murder the people selected, keeping their corpses intact, and then have their corpses shipped immediately to the Anatomical Institute in Strasbourg for the casts and skeletons he wanted for this collection.:\u200a882\u200aHirt directed that 115 persons be selected for measurements: 79 Jewish men, 30 Jewish women, 2 Poles, and 4 \"Asians\".:\u200a882\u200a They were selected among the inmates in August 1943 at Auschwitz by his assistants, the anthropologists Bruno Beger and Hans Fleischhacker. The group was quarantined to protect them from a typhus epidemic in the camp. Measurements were taken of the selected inmates at Auschwitz. Of those initially selected, it is believed that 89 persons (60 men and 29 women) were sent to Natzweiler-Struthof. Three men died en route, leaving 86 people.\n\nNatzweiler-Struthof camp\nThese 86 people were sent to Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp on 30 July 1943. They were fed reasonably well to improve their appearance for the body casts. They were divided into four groups and successively gassed by Josef Kramer, on 11, 13, 17, and 19 August 1943. Their bodies were returned to Hirt at the anatomical laboratory of the Reich University in Strasbourg for preparation as an anthropological display, taking body casts and preparing the skeletons.In September 1944, the rapid approach of the Allies led to the project being abandoned and Himmler ordered the destruction of all traces of this compromising collection.:\u200a883\u200a That order was not completed, nor had the casts been taken or the skeletons been prepared. The Allies found corpses and partial remains preserved in formalin for eighty-six bodies upon the liberation of Strasbourg.:\u200a884\u200a The corpses were buried 23 October 1945 in the municipal cemetery of Strasbourg-Robertsau before being transferred in 1951 to the Jewish cemetery of Strasbourg-Cronenbourg. The names of the victims were not known, and the purpose for their presence at the Anatomical Institute were not known. Some information was learned in post-war trials as to the project proposed by Hirt.\nAugust Hirt fled Strasbourg in September 1944, hiding in T\u00fcbingen in southern Germany across the river from Alsace.\n\nDeath\nHirt committed suicide on 2 June 1945, aged 47, at Schluchsee, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in the Black Forest. His suicide was not known when he was tried in absentia at the Military War Crimes Trial at Metz on 23 December 1953 for his war crimes. His death was finally confirmed in the mid-1960s when the Israeli secret service had his body exhumed, and an Israeli pathologist conclusively identified the bones.Some records prepared for his trial are in possession of the US National Archives, including the list of identification numbers tattooed on the prisoners at Auschwitz and \"Photocopies of certificates of proof of ancestry, in connection with research on prisoners in the Konzentrationslager Natzweiler, ...Feb. 9-Nov. 3, 1942. Partial copies of slips for the admittance of prisoners into the Konzentrationslager Natzweiler, medical examinations on prisoners, and a death certificate, Dec. 9, 1942-Aug. 9, 1944. Feb. 9, 1942-Aug. 9, 1944\".\n\nPosthumous\nIn the book, Die Namen der Nummern (The Names of the Numbers, 2004, ISBN 978-3455094640), Hans-Joachim Lang describes this mass murder. He also recounts how he was able to determine the identities of 86 victims, 60 years after they were murdered. In November 2005, the remains of some of these victims were buried in the Jewish cemetery of Cronenbourg on the outskirts of Strasbourg, in the same area where bodies of other victims were buried in 1951, names unknown. On 11 December 2005, a memorial engraved with the names of the 86 victims was placed there. In addition, a memorial plaque honoring the victims was placed outside the Anatomy Institute at Strasbourg's University Hospital. In 2015, a researcher, Raphael Toledano, identified tissue samples of victims in test tubes and a jar in the Strasbourg Medical Institute's closed collection. This followed his discovery of a 1952 letter from the then-director of the Institute, Camille Simonin, about the experiments directed by Hirt. On 6 September 2015, these remains were buried in the Cronenbourg Cemetery.\n\nSee also\nBlock 10\nAnton Dilger\nEduard Pernkopf\nHermann Stieve\nPassage 2:\nBAFTA Rising Star Award\nThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Rising Star Award, currently styled as the EE Rising Star Award for commercial reasons and previously known as the Orange Rising Star Award, is an award that acknowledges new talents in the acting industry. The award was created after Mary Selway's death in 2004. She has been recognised for her successful role as a casting director and has helped many new actors and actresses to their claim to fame. The five nominees are chosen regardless of gender, nationality and whether they have made a breakthrough in television, film or both. Despite the nominees being chosen by the BAFTA juries, the winner is chosen entirely by public votes via text, internet or phone. This award was sponsored by Orange UK until 2012 and has been sponsored by EE since 2013. The first winner was James McAvoy in 2006. Eva Green, Shia LaBeouf and Kristen Stewart have been the only non-British winners. The current holder of the award is Emma Mackey, who won in 2023.\n\nWinners and nominees\n2000s\n2010s\n2020s\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nJolyon James\nJolyon James is an Australian-born actor, writer and visual artist who creates work predominantly for young people. In 2018 he wrote directed and designed the Helpmann Award winning 'Robot Song' for Arena Theatre Company, the premiere work produced by the company after its relocation to regional Victoria. \nOther recent works by Jolyon include Trapper and A Cautionary Tales for Children starring Virginia Gay. As a visual artist Jolyon has exhibited regularly in Victoria and was a finalist in the National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2012. He performed the role of the Moonshadow in Cat Stevens's musical of the same name which is played in Melbourne\u2019s Princess Theatre for 12 weeks from 31 May 2012.\n\nEarly life\nJames was born in Western Australia in a remote country town. He studied at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), graduating in 1997. He performed the role of Jean Prouvaire, and understudied and performed the role of Enjolras in the 1999 Australian tour of Les Mis\u00e9rables and appeared on numerous Australian TV shows before moving to the UK in 2002 to broaden his horizons.\n\nActing career\nAfter graduating from WAAPA, James guest starred in Australian television shows Water Rats, Blue Heelers and The Secret Life of Us, as well as a role in the TV movie Never Tell Me Never. James secured the major role of Police Officer Con Stavros in the 2000 TV series Above the Law. In 2001 James starred as Sky in the Melbourne run of Mamma Mia! James directed the play This is Our Youth in Melbourne in 2002 and Perth in January 2003. After moving to London, James played a supporting role in the UK TV series Mad About Alice, and in 2005 appeared briefly in the Hollywood film The Wedding Date, playing Debra Messing's character's ex-boyfriend \"Woody\".\nBack in Australia, James appeared on TV screens again in shows such as Headland, City Homicide, Rush and Offspring, as well as playing Schuurman in the 2008 TV movie Krakatoa. He is a Director and member of the creative team behind Doorstep Ensemble, a theatre company which seeks to give up and coming community theatre performers a foot in the door to the professional industry, and he has both appeared in and directed a number of their productions. In 2011 James was both a tutor and mentor with Showfit, a 12-month course focused on developing performers\u2019 skills and confidence and eventually showcasing them to industry professionals.In 2012 James appeared in the title role of Moonshadow, a musical by Cat Stevens which premiered in Melbourne at the Princess Theatre, and performed the role of Indian John in Eddie Perfect's Shane Warne the Musical the following year.James has been in two Stephen Sondheim musicals. He first appeared in the 1998 Melbourne cast of Into the Woods as Rapunzel's Prince, and then in the 2014 Melbourne cast of Passion as Major Rizzolli.\n\nPhotography\nJames is also a photographic artist and is involved in a long term collaboration with Raphael Ruz entitled BILLIEJEANISNOTMYLOVER. They are based in Melbourne.\nJames also creates animation and video content for theatre productions and music video clips including the single \"Magnet\" by Kate Ceberano. He is a writer, director and producer and is currently the Artistic Associate for the Arena Theatre Company.\nPassage 4:\nCat Stevens\nYusuf Islam (born Steven Demetre Georgiou; 21 July 1948), commonly known by his stage names Cat Stevens, Yusuf, and Yusuf \/ Cat Stevens,  is a British singer-songwriter and musician. To date, he has sold over 100 million records and has over 2 billion streams. His musical style consists of folk, pop, rock, and, later in his career, Islamic music. Following two decades in which he only performed music which met strict religious standards, he returned to making secular music in 2006. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.His 1967 debut album and its title song \"Matthew and Son\" both reached top ten in the UK charts. Stevens' albums Tea for the Tillerman (1970) and Teaser and the Firecat (1971) were certified triple platinum in the US.  His 1972 album Catch Bull at Four went to No.1 on the Billboard 200 and spent weeks at the top of several other major charts. He earned ASCAP songwriting awards in 2005 and 2006 for \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\", which has been a hit for four artists. His other hit songs include \"Father and Son\", \"Wild World\", \"Moonshadow\", \"Peace Train\", and \"Morning Has Broken\".\nStevens converted to Islam in December 1977, and adopted the name Yusuf Islam the following year. In 1979, he auctioned all of his guitars for charity, and left his musical career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He has since bought back at least one of these guitars as a result of the efforts of his son Yoriyos. He was embroiled in a long-running controversy regarding comments he made in 1989, about the death fatwa placed on author Salman Rushdie in response to the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses. He has explained the incident stating: \"I was cleverly framed by certain questions. I never supported the fatwa.\" He has received two honorary doctorates and awards for promoting peace as well as other humanitarian awards.\nIn 2006, he returned to pop music by releasing his first new studio album of new pop songs in 28 years, entitled An Other Cup. With that release and subsequent ones, he dropped the surname \"Islam\" from the album cover art \u2013 using the stage name Yusuf as a mononym. In 2009, he released the album Roadsinger and, in 2014, he released the album Tell 'Em I'm Gone and began his first US tour since 1978.  His second North American tour since his resurgence, featuring 12 shows in intimate venues, ran from 12 September to 7 October 2016. In 2017, he released the album The Laughing Apple, now using the stage name Yusuf \/ Cat Stevens, using the Cat Stevens name for the first time in 39 years. In September 2020, he released Tea for the Tillerman 2, a reimagining of his classic album Tea for the Tillerman to celebrate its 50th anniversary, and in June 2023, King of a Land, a new studio album.\n\nLife and career\nEarly life (1948\u20131965)\nSteven Demetre Georgiou, born on 21 July 1948 in the Marylebone area of London, was the youngest child of a Cypriot father, Stavros Georgiou (1900\u20131978), and a Swedish mother, Ingrid Wickman (1915\u20131989).  He has an older sister, Anita (b. 1937), and a brother, David Gordon. The family lived above the Moulin Rouge, a restaurant his parents operated on the north end of Shaftesbury Avenue, a short walk from Piccadilly Circus in the Soho theatre district of London. All family members worked in the restaurant. His parents divorced when he was about eight years old but continued to maintain the family restaurant and live above it. Stevens has a half-brother, George Georgiou, born in Greece, presumably from his father's first marriage in Greece.Although his father was Greek Orthodox and his mother was a Baptist, Georgiou was sent to St Joseph Roman Catholic Primary School, Macklin Street, which was closer to his father's business on Drury Lane. Georgiou developed an interest in piano at a young age, eventually using the family baby grand piano to work out the chords, since no one else there played well enough to teach him. At 15, inspired by the popularity of the Beatles, he became interested in the guitar. He persuaded his father to pay \u00a38 (equivalent to \u00a3200 in 2021) for his first guitar, and he began playing it and writing songs. He occasionally escaped his family responsibilities by going to the rooftop above their home and listening to the tunes of the musicals drifting from around the corner on Denmark Street, then the centre of the British music industry. Stevens said that West Side Story particularly affected him and gave him a \"different view of life\". With interests in both art and music, he and his mother moved to G\u00e4vle, Sweden, where he attended primary school (Sol\u00e4ngsskolan) and started developing his drawing skills after being influenced by his uncle Hugo Wickman, a painter. They subsequently returned to England.He attended other local West End schools, where he says he was constantly in trouble and did poorly in everything but art. He was called 'the artist boy' and said, \"I was beat up, but I was noticed\". He took a one-year course at Hammersmith School of Art, considering a career as a cartoonist. Though he enjoyed art (his later record albums featured his original artwork), he decided to pursue a musical career. He began performing under the name \"Steve Adams\" in 1965 while at Hammersmith. At that point, his goal was to become a songwriter. As well as the Beatles, other musicians who influenced him were the Kinks, Bob Dylan, Nina Simone, blues artists Lead Belly and Muddy Waters, Biff Rose (particularly Rose's first album), Leo Kottke and Paul Simon. He also sought to emulate composers of musicals, such as Ira Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein. In 1965, he signed a publishing deal with Ardmore & Beechwood and recorded several demos, including \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\".\n\nMusical career (1966\u20131978)\nEarly musical career\nGeorgiou began performing his songs in London coffee houses and pubs. At first he tried to form a band, but realised he preferred performing solo. Thinking his birth name might be difficult to remember, he chose the stage name Cat Stevens, partly because a girlfriend said he had eyes like a cat, but mainly because \"I couldn't imagine anyone going to the record store and asking for 'that Steven Demetre Georgiou album'. And in England, and I was sure in America, they loved animals.\"In 1966, at age 18, he was heard by manager\/producer Mike Hurst, formerly of British vocal group the Springfields. Hurst arranged for him to record a demo and helped him get a record deal. Stevens's first singles were hits: \"I Love My Dog\" reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart; and \"Matthew and Son\", the title song from his debut album, reached number 2 in the UK. \"I'm Gonna Get Me a Gun\" was his second UK top 10 single, reaching number 6, and the album Matthew and Son reached number 7 on the UK Albums Chart.Over the next two years, Stevens recorded and toured with an eclectic group of artists ranging from Jimi Hendrix to Engelbert Humperdinck. He was considered a fresh-faced teen star, placing several single releases in the British pop music charts. Some of that success was attributed to the pirate radio station Wonderful Radio London, which gained him fans by playing his records. In August 1967, he was one of several recording artists who had benefited from the station to broadcast messages during its final hour to mourn its closure.His December 1967 album New Masters failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The album is now most notable for \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\", a song he sold for \u00a330 (equivalent to \u00a3600 in 2021) to P. P. Arnold and which became a massive hit for her and an international hit for Keith Hampshire, Rod Stewart, James Morrison, and Sheryl Crow. Forty years after he recorded the first demo of the song, it earned him back-to-back ASCAP \"Songwriter of the Year\" awards, in 2005 and 2006.\n\nTuberculosis\nStevens contracted tuberculosis in 1969 and was close to death at the time of his admission to the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, Sussex. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time, Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, \"To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut.\"He took up meditation, yoga, and metaphysics, read about other religions and became a vegetarian. As a result of his serious illness and long convalescence and as a part of his spiritual awakening and questioning, he wrote as many as 40 songs, many of which would appear on his albums in later years.\n\nChanges in musical sound after illness\nThe lack of success of Stevens' second album mirrored a difference of personal tastes in musical direction. He felt a growing resentment of producer Mike Hurst's attempts to re-create the style of his debut album, with heavy-handed orchestration and over-production, rather than the folk rock sound Stevens was attempting to produce. He admits having purposely sabotaged his own contract with Hurst, by making outlandishly expensive orchestral demands and threatening legal action; this achieved his goal: to be released from his contract with Deram Records, a sub-label of Decca Records.On regaining his health at home after his release from the hospital, Stevens recorded some of his newly written songs on his tape recorder and played his changing sound for several new record executives. He hired an agent, Barry Krost, who arranged an audition with Chris Blackwell of Island Records. Blackwell offered him a \"chance to record [his songs] whenever and with whomever he liked and, more importantly to Cat, however he liked\". With Krost's recommendation, Stevens signed Paul Samwell-Smith, previously the bassist of the Yardbirds, as his new producer.\n\nHeight of popularity\nSamwell-Smith paired Stevens with guitarist Alun Davies, who was at that time working as a session musician. Davies was the more experienced veteran of two albums that had already begun to explore the emerging genres of skiffle and folk rock music. Davies was also thought to be a perfect fit with Stevens, particularly for his \"fingerwork\" on the guitar, harmonising, and backing vocals. They originally met just to record Mona Bone Jakon, but soon developed a friendship. Davies, like Stevens, was a perfectionist, appearing at all sound checks to be sure that all the equipment and sound were prepared for each concert.The first single released from Mona Bone Jakon was \"Lady D'Arbanville\", which Stevens wrote about his young American girlfriend Patti D'Arbanville. The record had a madrigal sound, unlike most music played on pop radio, with djembes and bass in addition to Stevens' and Davies' guitars. It reached number 8 in the UK and was the first of his hits to get real airplay in the US. The single sold over 1 million copies and earned him a gold record in 1971. Other songs written for D'Arbanville included \"Maybe You're Right\" and \"Just Another Night\". \"Pop Star\", a song about his experience as a teen star, and \"Katmandu\", with Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel playing flute, were also featured. Mona Bone Jakon was an early example of the solo singer-songwriter album format that was becoming popular for other artists as well. Rolling Stone magazine compared its popularity with that of Elton John's Tumbleweed Connection, saying it was played \"across the board, across radio formats\".\nMona Bone Jakon was the precursor of Stevens' international breakthrough album, Tea for the Tillerman, which became a Top 10 Billboard hit. Within six months of its release, it had sold over 500,000 copies, attaining gold record status in the United Kingdom and the United States. The combination of Stevens' new folk rock style and accessible lyrics, which spoke of everyday situations and problems, mixed with the beginning of spiritual questions about life, remained in his music from then on. The album features the Top 20 single \"Wild World\"; a parting song after D'Arbanville moved on. \"Wild World\" has been credited as the song that gave Tea for the Tillerman 'enough kick' to get it played on FM radio. The head of Island Records, Chris Blackwell, was quoted as calling it \"the best album we've ever released\". Other album tracks include \"Hard-Headed Woman\", and \"Father and Son\" \u2013 sung by Stevens in baritone and tenor, portraying the struggle between fathers and sons who contrast their personal choices in life. In 2001, this album was certified by the RIAA as a Multi-Platinum record, having sold 3 million copies in the United States at that time. It is ranked at No. 206 in the 2003 list of \"Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".After his relationship with D'Arbanville ended, Stevens noted the effect it had on his writing, saying, \"Everything I wrote while I was away was in a transitional period and reflects that. Like Patti. A year ago we split; I had been with her for two years. What I write about Patti and my family... when I sing the songs now, I learn strange things. I learn the meanings of my songs late ...\"\nHaving established a signature sound, Stevens enjoyed a string of successes in the following years. 1971's Teaser and the Firecat album reached number two and achieved gold record status within three weeks of its release in the United States. It yielded several hits, including \"Peace Train\", \"Morning Has Broken\", and \"Moonshadow\". The album was also certified by the RIAA as a Multi-Platinum record in 2001, with over 3 million sold in the United States through that time. When interviewed on a Boston radio station, Stevens said about Teaser and the Firecat:\n\nI get the tune and then I just keep on singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a hypnotic state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want ...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, to get away from a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there ... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.\nFor seven months, in 1971 and 1972, Stevens was romantically linked to popular singer Carly Simon, while both were being produced by Samwell-Smith. During that time, they each wrote songs for, and about, one another. Simon wrote and recorded at least two Top 50 songs, \"Legend in Your Own Time\" and \"Anticipation\" about Stevens. He reciprocated with a song to her, written after their romance, entitled \"Sweet Scarlet\".His next album, Catch Bull at Four, released in 1972, was his most rapidly successful album in the United States, reaching gold record status in 15 days and holding the number one position for three weeks on the Billboard 200 and fifteen weeks at number one in the Australian ARIA Charts.\n\nFilm and television soundtracks\nIn July 1970, Stevens recorded one of his songs, \"But I Might Die Tonight\", for the Jerzy Skolimowski film Deep End. He contributed two songs to the 1971 film Harold and Maude, but was annoyed when director Hal Ashby decided to use the original demos instead of allowing Stevens to finish them. The film used seven other Stevens songs as well but, perhaps because of the dispute, the soundtrack album was not released until 2007.After his religious conversion in the late 1970s, Stevens stopped granting permission for his songs to be used in films. However, almost 20 years later, in 1997, the film Rushmore received his permission to use his songs \"Here Comes My Baby\" and \"The Wind\"; this showed a new willingness on his part to release music from his Western \"pop star\" days. In 2000, \"Peace Train\" was included in the movie Remember the Titans, and Almost Famous used the song \"The Wind\". In 2006 \"Peace Train\" featured in the soundtrack to We Are Marshall.\n\nLater recordings\nSubsequent releases in the 1970s also did well on the charts and in ongoing sales, although they did not touch the success Stevens had from 1970 to 1973. In 1973, Stevens moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as a tax exile from the United Kingdom; however, he later donated the money to UNESCO. During that time he created the album Foreigner, which was a departure from the music that had brought him to the height of his fame. It differed in several respects: it was entirely written by Stevens; he dropped his band; and, with the exception of some guitar on the title track and \"100 I Dream\", he produced the record without the assistance of Samwell-Smith, who had played a large role in catapulting him to fame.\n\nIn June 1974, while in Australia, Cat Stevens was presented with a plaque representing the sale of forty gold records, the largest number ever presented to an artist in Australia.In April 1977, his Izitso album updated his pop rock and folk rock style with the extensive use of synthesisers, giving it a more synthpop style. \"Was Dog a Doughnut\", in particular, was an early techno-pop fusion track and a precursor to the 1980s electro music genre, making early use of a music sequencer. Izitso included his last chart hit, \"(Remember the Days of the) Old Schoolyard\", an early synthpop song that used a polyphonic synthesiser; it was a duet with fellow UK singer Elkie Brooks.His final original album under the name Cat Stevens was Back to Earth, released in late 1978. It was also the first album produced by Samwell-Smith since the peak in Stevens' single album sales in the early 1970s. Several compilation albums were released before and after he stopped recording. After Stevens left Decca Records, they bundled his first two albums together as a set, hoping to ride the commercial tide of his early success; later his newer labels did the same, and Stevens also released compilations. The most successful of the compilation albums was the 1975 Greatest Hits which has sold over 4 million copies in the United States. In May 2003, he received his first Platinum Europe Award from the IFPI for Remember Cat Stevens: The Ultimate Collection, indicating over one million European sales.\n\nReligious conversion\nWhile on holiday in Marrakesh, Stevens was intrigued by the sound of the adh\u0101n, the Islamic ritual call to prayer, which was explained to him as \"music for God\". Stevens said, \"I thought, music for God? I'd never heard that before \u2013 I'd heard of music for money, music for fame, music for personal power, but music for God!?\"In 1976, Stevens nearly drowned off the coast of Malibu, California, and said he shouted, \"Oh, God! If you save me I will work for you.\"  He stated that, immediately afterwards, a wave appeared and carried him back to shore. This brush with death intensified his long-held quest for spiritual truth. He had looked into \"Buddhism, Zen, I Ching, numerology, tarot cards, and astrology\". Stevens' brother David Gordon, a convert to Judaism, brought him a copy of the Qur'an as a birthday gift from a trip to Jerusalem.Stevens said on BBC's Desert Island Discs: \"I would never have picked up the Qur'an myself as a free spirit; I was more aligned to my father's Greek Orthodox beliefs.\" His brother's timely gift was quickly absorbed and he was taken with its content, soon beginning his transition and conversion to Islam, which would change forever his private and professional life.During the time he was studying the Qur'an, Stevens began to identify more and more with the story of Joseph, a man bought and sold in the market place, which is how he said he had increasingly felt within the music business. Regarding his conversion, in his 2006 interview with Alan Yentob, he stated, \"To some people, it may have seemed like an enormous jump, but for me, it was a gradual move to this.\" And, in a Rolling Stone magazine interview, he reaffirmed that, saying, \"I had found the spiritual home I'd been seeking for most of my life. And if you listen to my music and lyrics, like \"Peace Train\" and \"On The Road To Find Out\", it clearly shows my yearning for direction and the spiritual path I was travelling.\"Stevens formally converted to the Muslim faith on 23 December 1977, taking the name Yusuf Islam in 1978. Yusuf is the Arabic rendition of the name Joseph; he stated that he \"always loved the name Joseph\" and was particularly drawn to the story of Joseph in the Qur'an. Although he discontinued his pop career, he was persuaded to perform one last time before what became his 25-year musical hiatus. Appearing with his hair freshly shorn and an untrimmed beard, he headlined a charity concert on 22 November 1979 in Wembley Stadium to benefit UNICEF's International Year of the Child. The concert closed with his performance along with David Essex, Alun Davies, and Islam's brother, David Gordon, who wrote the finale song  \"Child for a Day\".After a brief engagement to Louise Wightman, Islam married Fauzia Mubarak Ali on 7 September 1979, at Regent's Park Mosque in London.  They have one son, four daughters, and nine grandchildren; a second son died in infancy. They have a home in London while currently preferring to spend a major part of each year in Dubai.\n\nLife as Yusuf Islam (1978\u2013present)\nMuslim faith and musical career\nFollowing his conversion to Islam, Cat Stevens (now named Yusuf Islam), abandoned his musical career for nearly two decades. When he became a Muslim in 1977, the Imam at his mosque told him that it was fine to continue as a musician, as long as the songs were morally acceptable, but others were saying that \"it was all prohibited\", and he decided to avoid the question by ceasing to perform. He has said that there was \"a combination of reasons, really\", and that the continuing demands of the music business had been \"becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore\".In a 2004 interview on Larry King Live, he said \"A lot of people would have loved me to keep singing. You come to a point where you have sung, more or less ... your whole repertoire and you want to get down to the job of living. You know, up until that point, I hadn't had a life. I'd been searching, been on the road.\"Estimating in January 2007 that he was continuing to earn approximately US$1.5 million a year from his Cat Stevens music, he said he would use his accumulated wealth and ongoing earnings from his music career for philanthropic and educational causes in the Muslim community of London and elsewhere. In 1983, he founded the Islamia Primary School in Brondesbury Park, later moved to Salusbury Road, in the north London area of Queen's Park and, soon after, founded several Muslim secondary schools; in 1992, he set up The Association of Muslim Schools (AMS-UK), a charity that brought together all the Muslim schools in the UK. He is also the founder and chairman of the Small Kindness charity, which initially assisted famine victims in Africa and now supports thousands of orphans and families in the Balkans, Indonesia, and Iraq. He was chairman of the charity Muslim Aid from 1985 to 1993.\n\nSalman Rushdie controversy\nIn 1989, following an address by Islam to students at London's Kingston Polytechnic (now Kingston University), where he was asked about the fatwa calling for the killing of Salman Rushdie, author of the novel The Satanic Verses, Islam made a series of comments that appeared to show support for the fatwa. He stated, \"He (Rushdie) must be killed. The Qur'an makes it clear \u2013 if someone defames the prophet, then he must die.\" He released a statement the following day denying that he supported vigilantism and claiming that he had merely recounted the Islamic Sharia law punishment for blasphemy. Subsequently, he commented in a 1989 interview on Australian television that Rushdie should be killed and stated he would rather burn Rushdie instead of an effigy. In a statement in the FAQ section of one of his websites, Islam asserted that while he regretted the comments, he was joking and that the show was improperly edited. In the years since these comments he has repeatedly denied ever calling for the death of Rushdie or supporting the fatwa, a position contradicted by his contemporary public statements in 1989. Yusuf appearing on BBC's Desert Island Discs on 27 September 2020 claimed clever \"sharp-toothed\" journalists had framed his fatwa comment in a misleading way. In a 2007 letter to the editor of The Daily Telegraph, Rushdie complained of what he believed was Islam's attempts to \"rewrite his past\", and called his claims of innocence \"rubbish\". On August 12, 2022, Salman Rushdie suffered a knife attack as he was about to give a public lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, United States. In response to the awful attack Yusuf tweeted \"Saddened and shocked to learn about the horrific act on Salman Rushdie my wish is for us all to live in peace. May God grant him and every one else who has suffered from the manic pandemic of violence in this world, a full recovery. Peace\".\n\n11 September attacks\nImmediately following the September 11 attacks on the United States, he said:\n\nI wish to express my heartfelt horror at the indiscriminate terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While it is still not clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.\nHe appeared on videotape on a VH1 pre-show for the October 2001 Concert for New York City, condemning the attacks and singing his song \"Peace Train\" for the first time in public in more than 20 years, as an a cappella version. He also donated a portion of his box-set royalties to the fund for victims' families and the rest to orphans in underdeveloped countries. During the same year, he dedicated time and effort in joining the Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism, an organisation that worked towards battling misconceptions and acts against others because of their religious beliefs or their racial identity (or both), after many Muslims reported a backlash against them due in part to the grief caused by the events in the United States on 11 September.\n\nDenial of entry into the United States\nOn 21 September 2004, Islam was on a United Airlines flight from London to Washington, travelling to a meeting with US entertainer Dolly Parton, who had recorded \"Peace Train\" several years earlier and was planning to include another Cat Stevens song on an upcoming album. While the plane was in flight, his name was flagged as being on the No Fly List. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers alerted the United States Transportation Security Administration, which then diverted his flight to Bangor, Maine, where he was detained by officers from the Department of Homeland Security.The following day, he was denied entry and flown back to the United Kingdom. A spokesman for Homeland Security claimed there were \"concerns of ties he may have to potential terrorist-related activities\". The Israeli government had deported Islam in 2000 over allegations that he provided funding to the Palestinian organisation Hamas, but he denied doing so knowingly. Islam stated \"I have never knowingly supported or given money to Hamas\". \"At the time I was reported to have done it, I didn't know such a group existed. Some people give a political interpretation to charity. We were horrified at how people were suffering in the Holy Land.\"However, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) added him to a \"watch list\" which provoked an international controversy and led the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to complain personally to the United States Secretary of State Colin Powell at the United Nations. Powell responded by stating that the watchlist was under review, adding, \"I think we have that obligation to review these matters to see if we are right\".Islam believed his inclusion on a \"watch list\" may have simply been an error: a mistaken identification of him for a man with the same name, but different spelling. On 1 October 2004 he requested the removal of his name, \"I remain bewildered by the decision of the US authorities to refuse me entry to the United States\". According to his statement, the man on the list was named \"Youssef Islam\", indicating that Islam was not the suspected terrorism supporter. Romanisation of Arabic names can easily result in different spellings: the transliteration of Yusuf gives rise to a dozen spellings.\nTwo years later, in December 2006, Islam was admitted without incident into the United States for several radio concert performances and interviews to promote his new record. He said of the incident at the time, \"No reason was ever given, but being asked to repeat the spelling of my name again and again, made me think it was a fairly simple mistake of identity. Rumours which circulated after made me imagine otherwise.\"Islam wrote a song about his 2004 exclusion from the US, entitled \"Boots and Sand\", recorded in 2008 and featuring Paul McCartney, Dolly Parton, and Terry Sylvester.\n\nLibel cases\nLawsuit over News UK newspaper reports that he had supported terrorism\nIn October 2004, The Sun and The Sunday Times newspapers voiced their support for Yusuf's exclusion from the United States and claimed that he had supported terrorism. He sued for libel and received an out-of-court financial settlement from the newspapers, which both published apology statements saying that he had never supported terrorism and mentioning that he had recently been given a Man of Peace award from the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates. However The Sunday Times managing editor Richard Caseby said that while there was an \"agreed settlement\", they \"always denied liability\" and \"disagreed with Cat Stevens' lawyers interpretation\", but took a \"pragmatic view\" of the lawsuit.Yusuf responded that he was \"delighted by the settlement [which] helps vindicate my character and good name. ... It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilous accusations against Muslims and, in my case, it directly impacts on my relief work and damages my reputation as an artist. The harm done is often difficult to repair\", and added that he intended to donate the financial award given to him by the court to help orphans of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. He wrote about the experience in a newspaper article entitled \"A Cat in a Wild World\".\n\nLawsuit about allegations that he would not talk to unveiled women\nOn 18 July 2008, Islam received substantial undisclosed damages from the World Entertainment News Network following their publication of a story which claimed that the singer refused to speak to unveiled women. The allegations first surfaced in the German newspaper BZ after Islam's trip to Berlin in March 2007 to collect the Echo music award for \"life achievements as musician and ambassador between cultures\". Once again he was awarded damages after the World Entertainment News Network allowed an article to be published on Contactmusic.com alleging that he would not speak to unveiled women with the exception of his wife. His solicitor said \"he was made out to be 'so sexist and bigoted that he refused at an awards ceremony to speak to or even acknowledge any women who were not wearing a veil'\". The news agency apologised and issued a statement saying that Islam has never had any problem in working with women and that he has never required a third party to function as an intermediary at work. The money from this lawsuit went to his Small Kindness Charity.On his website, he discussed the false allegation, saying,\n\nThe accusation that I do not speak or interact with ladies who are not veiled is an absurdity.... It's true that I have asked my manager to respectfully request that lady presenters refrain from embracing me when giving awards or during public appearances, but that has nothing to do with my feelings or respect for them. Islam simply requires me to honour the dignity of ladies or young girls who are not closely related to me, and avoid physical intimacy, however innocent it may be.\n... My four daughters all follow the basic wearing of clothes which modestly cover their God-given beauty. They're extremely well educated; they do not cover their faces and interact perfectly well with friends and society.\n\nReturn to music\n1990s\u20132006: as Yusuf Islam\nIslam gradually resumed his musical career in the 1990s. These initial recordings did not include any musical instruments other than percussion, and they featured lyrics about Islamic themes, some in spoken word or hamd form. He invested in building his own recording studio which he named Mountain of Light Studios in the late 1990s, and he was featured as a guest singer on \"God Is the Light\", a song on an album of nasheeds by the group Raihan. In addition, he invited and collaborated with other Muslim singers, including Canadian artist Dawud Wharnsby. After Islam's friend, Irfan Ljubijanki\u0107, the Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was killed by a Serbian rocket attack, Islam appeared at a 1997 benefit concert in Sarajevo and recorded a benefit album named after a song written by Ljubijanki\u0107, I Have No Cannons That Roar.Realising there were few educational resources designed to teach children about the Islamic religion, Islam wrote and produced a children's album, A Is for Allah, in 2000 with the assistance of South African singer-songwriter Zain Bhikha. The title song was one Islam had written years before to introduce his first child to both the religion and the Arabic alphabet. He also established his own record label, \"Jamal Records\", and Mountain of Light Productions, and he donates a percentage of his projects' proceeds to his Small Kindness charity, whose name is taken from the Qur'an.On the occasion of the 2000 re-release of his Cat Stevens albums, at the urging of his label rep Sujata, Islam agreed to interviews with the media to tell his story and reconnect with his fans. Islam explained that he had stopped performing in English due to his misunderstanding of the Islamic faith. \"This issue of music in Islam is not as cut-and-dried as I was led to believe ... I relied on heresy,  that was perhaps my mistake.\" He also participated in the first documentary on his life for a two-part VH1 Behind the Music.Islam has reflected that his decision to leave the Western pop music business was perhaps too quick with too little communication for his fans. For most it was a surprise, and even his long-time guitarist Alun Davies said in later interviews that he hadn't believed that his friend would actually go through with it after his many forays into other religions throughout their relationship. Islam himself has said the \"cut\" between his former life and his life as a Muslim might have been too quick, and too severe, and that more people might have been better informed about Islam, and given an opportunity to better understand it, and himself, if he had simply removed those items that were considered har\u0101m, in his performances, allowing him to express himself musically and educate listeners through his music without violating any religious constraints.In 2003, after repeated encouragement from within the Muslim world, Islam once again recorded \"Peace Train\" for a compilation CD, which also included performances by David Bowie and Paul McCartney. He performed \"Wild World\" in Nelson Mandela's 46664 concert with his earlier collaborator, Peter Gabriel, the first time he had publicly performed in English in 25 years. In December 2004, he and Ronan Keating released a new version of \"Father and Son\": the song entered the charts at number two, behind Band Aid 20's  \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" They also produced a video of the pair walking between photographs of fathers and sons, while singing the song. The proceeds of \"Father and Son\" were donated to the Band Aid charity. Keating's former group, Boyzone, had a hit with the song a decade earlier. As he had been persuaded before, Islam contributed to the song, because the proceeds were marked for charity.\n\nOn 21 April 2005, Islam gave a short talk before a scheduled musical performance in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on the anniversary of the prophet Muhammad's birthday. He said: There is a great deal of ignorance in the world about Islam today, and we hope to communicate with the help of something more refined than lectures and talks. Our recordings are particularly appealing to the young, having used songs as well as Qur'an verses with pleasing sound effects ...\nIslam observed that there are no real guidelines about instruments and no references about the business of music in the Qur'an, and that Muslim travellers first brought the guitar to Moorish Spain. He noted that Muhammad was fond of celebrations, as in the case of the birth of a child, or a traveller arriving after a long journey. Thus, Islam concluded that healthy entertainment was acceptable within limitations, and that he now felt that it was no sin to perform with the guitar.  Music, he now felt, is uplifting to the soul; something sorely needed in troubled times. At that point, he was joined by several young male singers who sang backing vocals and played a drum, with Islam as lead singer and guitarist. They performed two songs, both half in Arabic and half in English; \"Tala'a Al-Badru Alayna\", an old song in Arabic which Islam recorded with a folk sound to it, and another song, \"The Wind East and West\", which was newly written by Islam and featured a distinct R&B sound.\nWith this performance, Islam began slowly to integrate instruments into both older material from his Cat Stevens era (some with slight lyrical changes) and new songs, both those known to the Muslim communities around the world and some that have the same Western flair from before with a focus on new topics and another generation of listeners.In a 2005 press release, he explained his revived recording career:\n\nAfter I embraced Islam, many people told me to carry on composing and recording, but at the time I was hesitant, for fear that it might be for the wrong reasons. I felt unsure what the right course of action was. I guess it is only now, after all these years, that I've come to fully understand and appreciate what everyone has been asking of me. It's as if I've come full circle; however, I have gathered a lot of knowledge on the subject in the meantime.\n\nIn early 2005, Islam released a new song, entitled \"Indian Ocean\", about the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami disaster. The song featured Indian composer\/producer A. R. Rahman, a-ha keyboard player Magne Furuholmen and Travis drummer Neil Primrose. Proceeds of the single went to help orphans in Banda Aceh, one of the areas worst affected by the tsunami, through Islam's Small Kindness charity. At first, the single was released only through several online music stores but later featured on the compilation album Cat Stevens: Gold. \"I had to learn my faith and look after my family, and I had to make priorities. But now I've done it all and there's a little space for me to fill in the universe of music again.\"On 28 May 2005, Islam delivered a keynote speech and performed at the Adopt-A-Minefield Gala in D\u00fcsseldorf. The Adopt-A-Minefield charity, under the patronage of Paul McCartney, works internationally to raise awareness and funds to clear landmines and rehabilitate landmine survivors. Islam attended as part of an honorary committee which also included George Martin, Richard Branson, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Klaus Voormann, Christopher Lee and others.In mid-2005, Islam played guitar for the Dolly Parton album Those Were the Days on her version of his \"Where Do the Children Play?\" (Parton had also covered \"Peace Train\" a few years earlier.)\nIslam has credited his then 21-year-old son Muhammad Islam, also a musician and artist, for his return to secular music, when the son brought a guitar back into the house, which Islam began playing. Muhammad's professional name is Yoriyos and his debut album was released in February 2007. Yoriyos created the art on Islam's album An Other Cup, something that Cat Stevens did for his own albums in the 1970s.\nIn May 2006, in anticipation of his forthcoming new pop album, the BBC1 programme Imagine aired a 49-minute documentary with Alan Yentob called Yusuf: The Artist formerly Known as Cat Stevens. This documentary film features rare audio and video clips from the late 1960s and 1970s, as well as an extensive interview with Islam, his brother David Gordon, several record executives, Bob Geldof, Dolly Parton, and others outlining his career as Cat Stevens, his conversion and emergence as Yusuf Islam, and his return to music in 2006. There are clips of him singing in the studio when he was recording An Other Cup as well as a few 2006 excerpts of him on guitar singing a few verses of Cat Stevens songs including \"The Wind\" and \"On the Road to Find Out\".In December 2006, Islam was one of the artists who performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, in honour of the prize winners, Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. He performed the songs \"Midday (Avoid City After Dark)\", \"Peace Train\", and \"Heaven\/Where True Love Goes\". He also gave a concert in New York City that month as a Jazz at Lincoln Center event, recorded and broadcast by KCRW-FM radio, along with an interview by Nic Harcourt. Accompanying him, as in the Cat Stevens days, was Alun Davies, on guitar and vocals.\n\n2006\u20132017: as Yusuf\n2006\u20132008: An Other Cup and appearances\nIn March 2006, Islam finished recording his first all-new pop album since 1978. The album, An Other Cup, was released internationally in November 2006 on his own label, Ya Records (distributed by Polydor Records in the UK, and internationally by Atlantic Records)\u2014the 40th anniversary of his first album, Matthew and Son. An accompanying single, called \"Heaven\/Where True Love Goes\", was also released. The album was produced with Rick Nowels, who has worked with Dido and Rod Stewart. The performer is noted as \"Yusuf\", with a cover label identifying him as \"the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens\". The art on the album is credited to Yoriyos. Islam wrote all of the songs except \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\", and recorded it in the United States and the United Kingdom.Islam actively promoted this album, appearing on radio, television and in print interviews. In November 2006, he told the BBC, \"It's me, so it's going to sound like that of course ... This is the real thing ... When my son brought the guitar back into the house, you know, that was the turning point. It opened a flood of, of new ideas and music which I think a lot of people would connect with.\" Originally, he began to return only to his acoustic guitar as he had in the past, but his son encouraged him to \"experiment\", which resulted in the purchase of a Stevie Ray Vaughan Fender Stratocaster in 2007.\nAlso in November 2006, Billboard magazine was curious as to why the artist is credited as just his first name, \"Yusuf\" rather than \"Yusuf Islam\". His response was \"Because 'Islam' doesn't have to be sloganised. The second name is like the official tag, but you call a friend by their first name. It's more intimate, and to me that's the message of this record.\" As for why the album sleeve says \"the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens\", he responded, \"That's the tag with which most people are familiar; for recognition purposes I'm not averse to that. For a lot of people, it reminds them of something they want to hold on to. That name is part of my history and a lot of the things I dreamt about as Cat Stevens have come true as Yusuf Islam.\"Islam was asked by the Swiss periodical Das Magazin why the title of the album was An Other Cup, rather than \"Another Cup\". The answer was that his breakthrough album, Tea for the Tillerman in 1970, was decorated with Islam's painting of a peasant sitting down to a cup of steaming drink on the land. He commented that the two worlds \"then, and now, are very different\". His new album shows a steaming cup alone on this cover. His answer was that this was actually an other cup; something different; a bridge between the East and West, which he explained was his own perceived role. He added that, through him, \"Westerners might get a glimpse of the East, and Easterners, some understanding of the West. The cup, too, is important; it's a meeting place, a thing meant to be shared.\"On CBS Sunday Morning in December 2006, he said, \"You know, the cup is there to be filled ... with whatever you want to fill it with. For those people looking for Cat Stevens, they'll probably find him in this record. If you want to find [Yusuf] Islam, go a bit deeper, you'll find him.\" He has since described the album as being \"over-produced\" and refers to An Other Cup as being a necessary hurdle he had to overcome before he could release his new album, Roadsinger.In April 2007, BBC1 broadcast a concert given at the Porchester Hall by Islam as part of BBC Sessions, his first live performance in London in 28 years (the previous one being the UNICEF \"Year of the Child\" concert in 1979). He played several new songs along with some old ones like \"Father and Son\", \"The Wind\", \"Where Do the Children Play?\", \"Don't Be Shy\", \"Wild World\", and \"Peace Train\".In July 2007, he performed at a concert in Bochum, Germany, in benefit of Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Peace Centre in South Africa and the Milagro Foundation of Deborah and Carlos Santana. The audience included Nobel Laureates Mikhail Gorbachev, Desmond Tutu and other prominent global figures. He later appeared as the final act in the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg performing some classic Cat Stevens songs and more recent compositions reflecting his concern for peace and child welfare. His set included Stevie Wonder's \"Saturn\", \"Peace Train\", \"Where Do the Children Play?\", \"Ruins\", and \"Wild World\". He performed at the Peace One Day concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 21 September 2007.\nIn 2008 Islam contributed the song \"Edge of Existence\" to the charity album Songs for Survival, in support of the indigenous rights organisation Survival International.\n\n2009\u20132014: Roadsinger, \"My People\" and tours\nIn January 2009, Yusuf released a single in aid of children in Gaza, a rendition of the George Harrison song, \"The Day the World Gets Round\", along with the German bassist Klaus Voormann, who had formerly collaborated with The Beatles. To promote the new single, Voormann redesigned his famous Beatles Revolver album cover, drawing a picture of a young Cat Stevens along with himself and Harrison. Proceeds from the single were donated to charities and organisations including UNESCO, UNRWA, and the nonprofit group Save the Children, with the funds earmarked for Gaza children. Israeli Consul David Saranga criticised Yusuf for not dedicating the song to all of the children who are victims of the conflict, including Israeli children.On 5 May 2009, Yusuf released Roadsinger, a new pop album recorded in 2008. The lead track, \"Thinking 'Bout You\", received its debut radio play on a BBC programme on 23 March 2009. Unlike An Other Cup, he promoted the new album with appearances on American television as well as in the UK. He appeared on The Chris Isaak Hour on the A&E network in April 2009, performing live versions of his new songs, \"World O'Darkness\", \"Boots and Sand\", and \"Roadsinger\". On 13 May he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in Los Angeles, and on 14 May, on The Colbert Report in New York City, performing the title song from the Roadsinger album. On 15 May, he appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing \"Boots and Sand\" and \"Father and Son\". On 24 May he appeared on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, where he was interviewed and performed the title track of Roadsinger. On 15 August, he was one of many guests at Fairport Convention's annual Fairport's Cropredy Convention where he performed five songs accompanied by Alun Davies, with Fairport Convention as his backing band.A world tour was announced on his web site to promote the new album. He was scheduled to perform at an invitation-only concert at New York City's Highline Ballroom on 3 May 2009 and to go on to Los Angeles, Chicago and Toronto, as well as some to-be-announced European venues. However, the New York appearance was postponed due to issues regarding his work visa. He appeared in May 2009 at Island Records' 50th Anniversary concert in London. In November and December 2009, Yusuf undertook his \"Guess I'll Take My Time Tour\" which also showcased his musical play Moonshadow. The tour took him to Dublin, where he had a mixed reception; subsequently he was well received in Birmingham and Liverpool, culminating in an emotional performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In June 2010 he toured Australia for the first time in 36 years, and New Zealand for the first time ever.\nOn 30 October 2010, Yusuf appeared at Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's spoof Rally to Restore Sanity and\/or Fear in Washington, DC, singing alongside Ozzy Osbourne. Yusuf performed \"Peace Train\" and Ozzy performed \"Crazy Train\" at the same time, followed by The O'Jays performance of \"Love Train\".On 2 March 2011, Yusuf released his latest song, \"My People\", as a free download available through his official website, as well as numerous other online outlets. Said to have been recorded at a studio located within a hundred yards of the site of the Berlin Wall, the song is inspired by a series of popular uprisings in the Arab world, known as the Arab Spring.On 1 April 2011, he launched a new tour website (yusufinconcert.com) to commemorate his first European tour in over 36 years scheduled from 7 May to 2 June 2011. The ten-date tour visited Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, Oberhausen, Berlin, Munich, Rotterdam, Paris, Mannheim, Vienna and Brussels.In May 2012, Moonshadow, a new musical featuring music from throughout his career opened at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, Australia.
