##  Graph Types
Based on the entity and relation, we categorize the graph into the following types:

+ **Chunk Tree**: A tree structure formed by document content and summary.
+ **Passage Graph**: A relational network composed of passages, tables, and other elements within documents.
+ **KG**: knowledge graph (KG) is constructed by extracting entities and relationships from each chunk, which contains only entities and relations, is commonly represented as triples.
+ **TKG**: A textual knowledge graph (TKG) is a specialized KG (following the same construction step as KG), which enriches entities with detailed descriptions and type information.
+ **RKG**: A rich knowledge graph (RKG), which further incorporates keywords associated with relations.

The criteria for the classification of graph types are as follows:

|Graph Attributes | Chunk Tree |Passage Graph | KG  | TKG | RKG |
| --- |--- |--- |--- | --- | --- |
|Original Content| ✅|✅| ❌|❌|❌| 
|Entity Name| ❌|❌|✅|✅|✅|
|Entity Type| ❌| ❌| ❌|✅|✅|
|Entity Description|❌| ❌| ❌|✅|✅|
|Relation Name| ❌|❌|✅|❌|✅|
|Relation keyword|❌| ❌| ❌|❌|✅|
|Relation Description|❌| ❌| ❌|✅|✅|
|Edge Weight| ❌|❌|✅|✅|✅|

##  Operators in the Retrieve Stage 
> The retrieval stage lies the **key role** ‼️ in the entire GraphRAG process. ✨ The goal is to identify query-relevant content that supports the generation phase, enabling the LLM to provide more **accurate** responses.


💡💡💡 After thoroughly reviewing all implementations, we've distilled them into a set of **16** operators 🧩🧩. Each method then constructs its retrieval module by combining one or more of these operators 🧩.

### Five Types of Operators

> We classify the operators into five categories, each offering a different way to retrieve and structure relevant information from graph-based data.


#### ⭕️ Entity Operators
> Retrieve entities (e.g., people, places, organizations) that are most relevant to the given query.

| Name | Description | Example Methods  |
|---|---|---|
| **VDB**  | Select top-k nodes from the vector database  | G-retriever, RAPTOR, KGP |
| **RelNode** | Extract nodes from given relationships | LightRAG  |
| **PPR** | Run PPR on the graph, return top-k nodes with PPR scores | FastGraphRAG  | 
| **Agent** | Utilizes LLM to find the useful entities| ToG |
| **Onehop** | Selects the one-hop neighbor entities of the given entities| LightRAG |
| **Link** | Return top-1 similar entity for each given entity| HippoRAG |
| **TF-IDF** | Rank entities based on the TF-IFG matrix| KGP |



#### ➡️ Relationship Operators
> Extracting useful relationships for the given query.

| Name | Description | Example Methods |
|---|---|---|
| **VDB** | Retrieve relationships by vector-database| LightRAG、G-retriever |
| **Onehop** | Selects relationships linked by one-hop neighbors of the given selected entities | Local Search for MS GraphRAG |
| **Aggregator** | Compute relationship scores from entity PPR matrix, return top-k | FastGraphRAG |
| **Agent**| Utilizes LLM to find the useful entities| ToG|


#### 📄 Chunk Operators
> Retrieve the most relevant text segments (chunks) related to the query.

                                      
| Name               | Description                                                    | Example Methods              |
|---|---|---|
| **Aggregator** | Use the relationship scores and the relationship-chunk interactions to select the top-k chunks | HippoRAG |
| **FromRel** | Return chunks containing given relationships | LightRAG |
| **Occurrence** | Rank top-k chunks based on occurrence of both entities in relationships | Local Search for MS GraphRAG |



#### 📈 Subgraph Operators
> Extract a relevant subgraph for the given query

| Name  | Description | Example Methods |
|---|---|---|
| **KhopPath** | Find k-hop paths with start and endpoints in the given entity set | DALK |
| **Steiner** | Compute Steiner tree based on given entities and relationships  | G-retriever     |
| **AgentPath** |  Identify the most relevant 𝑘-hop paths to a given question, by using LLM to filter out the irrelevant paths | TOG   |




#### 🔗 Community Operators
> Identify high-level information, which is only used for MS GraphRAG.


| **Name** | **Description**   | **Example Methods**  |
|---|---|---|
| **Entity**  | Detects communities containing specified entities   | Local Search for MS GraphRAG                   |
| **Layer**  | Returns all communities below a required layer | Global Search for MS GraphRAG                  | 


You can freely 🪽 combine those operators 🧩 to create more and more GraphRAG methods. 


#### 🌰 Examples 
> Below, we present some examples illustrating how existing algorithms leverage these operators.


| Name | Operators|
|---|---|
| **HippoRAG**     | Chunk (Aggregator) |
| **LightRAG**     | Chunk (FromRel) + Entity (RelNode) + Relationship (VDB)                          |
| **FastGraphRAG** | Chunk (Aggregator) + Entity (PPR) + Relationship (Aggregator)  |
