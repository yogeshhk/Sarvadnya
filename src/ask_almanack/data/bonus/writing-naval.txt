NAVAL'S WRITING
LIFE FORMULAS I (2008) 
These are notes to myself. Your frame of reference, and therefore your calculations, may vary. These are not definitions—these are algorithms for success. Contributions are welcome. 

→ Happiness = Health + Wealth + Good Relationships 
→ Health = Exercise + Diet + Sleep 
→ Exercise = High Intensity Resistance Training + Sports + Rest 
→ Diet = Natural Foods + Intermittent Fasting + Plants 
→ Sleep = No alarms + 8–9 hours + Circadian rhythms 
→ Wealth = Income + Wealth * (Return on Investment) 
→ Income = Accountability + Leverage + Specific Knowledge 
→ Accountability = Personal Branding + Personal Platform + Taking Risk? 
→ Leverage = Capital + People + Intellectual Property 
→ Specific Knowledge = Knowing how to do something society cannot yet easily train other people to do 
→ Return on Investment = “Buy-and-Hold” + Valuation + Margin of Safety [72]

NAVAL’S RULES (2016) 
→ Be present above all else.

→ Anger is a hot coal you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at someone else. (Buddha) 
→ If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day. 
→ Reading (learning) is the ultimate meta-skill and can be traded for anything else. 
→ All the real benefits in life come from compound interest. 
→ Earn with your mind, not your time.
