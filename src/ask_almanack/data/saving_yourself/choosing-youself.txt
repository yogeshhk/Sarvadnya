CHOOSING TO BE YOURSELF
PART II - SAVING YOURSELF
Doctors won’t make you healthy. 
Nutritionists won’t make you slim. 
Teachers won’t make you smart. 
Gurus won’t make you calm. 
Mentors won’t make you rich. 
Trainers won’t make you fit. 
Ultimately, you have to take responsibility. 
Save yourself.
A lot of what goes on today is what many of you are doing right now—beating yourself up and scribbling notes and saying, “I need to do this, and I need to do that, and I need to do…” No, you don’t need to do anything. 

All you should do is what you want to do. If you stop trying to figure out how to do things the way other people want you to do them, you get to listen to the little voice inside your head that wants to do things a certain way. Then, you get to be you. 

I never met my greatest mentor. I wanted so much to be like him. But his message was the opposite: Be yourself, with passionate intensity. 
No one in the world is going to beat you at being you. You’re never going to be as good at being me as I am. I’m never going to be as good at being you as you are. Certainly, listen and absorb, but don’t try to emulate. It’s a fool’s errand. Instead, each person is uniquely qualified at something. They have some specific knowledge, capability, and desire nobody else in the world does, purely from the combinatorics of human DNA and development. 

The combinatorics of human DNA and experience are staggering. You will never meet any two humans who are substitutable for each other.
Your goal in life is to find the people, business, project, or art that needs you the most. There is something out there just for you. What you don’t want to do is build checklists and decision frameworks built on what other people are doing. You’re never going to be them. You’ll never be good at being somebody else. [4]

To make an original contribution, you have to be irrationally obsessed with something
