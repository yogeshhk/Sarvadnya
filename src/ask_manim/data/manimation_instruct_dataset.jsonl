{"text": "<s>[INST] Generate accurate and correct ManimCE Python code for the animation requested by the user. Here is the user's request: I would like to create an educational math animation that explains the concept of Fourier Series with voiceover using a simple and elegantly animated whiteboard style presentation. The animation should start by stating \"We know that the basic trigonometric series is...\", followed by the appearance of the corresponding mathematical equation. Then, it should explain that this becomes a Fourier Series when specific terms are substituted with particular integral expressions, and it should display these integrals clearly.\n\nThe important elements of the animation include:\n- High-quality text and equations that are clear and easy to read.\n- The use of engaging voiceover with a natural English accent, preferable male, that fluidly narrates the information as it appears on screen.\n- The voiceover should have a style that resembles a casual but authoritative newscasting tone.\n- Smooth transitions should be present as different parts of the equations appear.\n- At the end of each section of explanation, the corresponding text and mathematical expressions should appropriately scale and move to make room for the next part of the lesson.\n- The term \"Fourier Series\" should be highlighted when it is described.\n- The function f(x), as it is introduced, should be emphasized as a single-valided function defined in the interval \\(-\\pi, \\pi\\).\n- The animation should end with a \"Thank you for watching.\" message the voiceover narrates, and should be accompanied by an animation that interacts with the last shown expression or piece of text.\n\nAlso, I want a concluding gesture that signals the end of the presentation. The animation should be clear and engaging, aiming to make the concept of Fourier Series understandable for students with at least some pre-calculus knowledge.

{"text": "<s>[INST] Generate accurate and correct ManimCE Python code for the animation requested by the user. Here is the user's request: I would like an educational video animation that explains the relationship between the areas of a right triangle and its legs. The animation should start by drawing a right triangle on the screen with the sides labeled \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\". Include a perpendicular height \"h\" from the right angle to the hypotenuse and label the intersection \"D\".\n\nNext, the animation should show that the area of the full triangle \"ABC\" can be broken down into two smaller triangles, \"ADC\" and \"BDC\". Indicate the areas of the smaller triangles with semi-transparent colors and transition their representations to simplified area formulas involving \"h\", the respective \"x\" and \"y\" (which are the lengths of \"AD\" and \"BD\" respectively), and the area formula for a triangle. Then, using these colored areas, the animation should illustrate that the sum of the areas of triangles \"ADC\" and \"BDC\" is equal to the area of triangle \"ABC\" by moving them next to it.\n\nPlease clarify the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the area by transitioning from the area formulas to the expression \"ab = h(x + y)\" where \"a\" and \"b\" are the legs and \"c\" is the hypotenuse of the triangle \"ABC\". Then, show a further simplification to \"ab = hc\", since \"c\" is the sum of \"x\" and \"y\". \n\nSubsequently, reformulate \"ab = hc\" to \"ab/h = c\" and underscore the significance of this result by shifting the formula and the triangle to make room for the next part of the lesson.\n\nThe final segment should introduce the Pythagorean theorem, \"a^2 + b^2 = c^2\", and use the earlier result \"ab/h = c\" to make a substitution into the theorem. Exhibit some algebra that involves squares and fractions, demonstrating the transition from \"a^2 + b^2 = (ab/h)^2\" to the final form, \"1/a^2 + 1/b^2 = 1/h^2\". Conclude the lesson by emphasizing the 'inverse Pythagorean theorem' with a surrounding rectangle to highlight it.\n\nLastly, ensure all of these steps are clearly depicted with smooth animations and pauses for effect where appropriate, such as after each major transition or revelation.

{"text": "<s>[INST] Generate accurate and correct ManimCE Python code for the animation requested by the user. Here is the user's request: I would like to create an educational math animation that showcases a three-dimensional red spiral that coils around an axis. The animation should feature the spiral rotating slowly to allow a clear view from multiple angles. The spiral needs to look like it's rising upwards as it extends outward in a circular pattern, similar to a spring or the threads on a screw. The background should include a set of 3D axes to help visualize the spiral in three-dimensional space. The animation should start with the camera positioned at a slight elevation and an angle that gives a good initial view of the spiral and axes.

The animation should display the series sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^2, then introduce the concept of the p-test for convergence with the condition p > 1.

Each step of this process should be accompanied by a visual text or mathematical notation on the screen, with pauses between each step for emphasis. The final conclusion should stand out clearly and the entire sequence should be clear and engaging for students learning about series convergence for the first time.

Here is the user's request: I want to create an educational animation explaining the convergence of the infinite series sum from n equals 1 to infinity of 1 over n squared using the integral test. Begin by displaying the series on the screen, followed by a statement that we will test for convergence using the integral test. Transform the series into the equivalent integral from 1 to infinity of 1 over x squared, then indicate that since the integral is convergent, the series is convergent as well. After that, reveal that this series is a known convergent series referred to as the Basel problem, and conclude the animation by showing that the series equals pi squared over 6. Make sure there are pauses between the steps for better understanding, and clear the scene before presenting the final conclusion.

Here is the user's request: I want an animation that explains the concept of simple harmonic motion and its general solution equation through a series of mathematical steps. The animation should start with presenting the second-order linear differential equation that describes simple harmonic motion. Then, it should introduce the characteristic equation that is used to solve the differential equation and animate the solving process to find the characteristic roots. After that, I'd like to see the general solution to the differential equation, which combines cosine and sine terms, and end with a statement that acknowledges the resulting expression represents simple harmonic motion. Each step should be accompanied by brief textual explanations that appear at the top of the screen, and the transition between steps should be smooth and clear for educational purposes.

Once the bonds are formed, the resulting molecule should move to the right and then back to its original position. Lastly, I want to introduce an electron into the scene, have it appear from the center, and then have all the elements and bonds fade away at the end.

{"text": "<s>[INST] Generate accurate and correct ManimCE Python code for the animation requested by the user. Here is the user's request: I would like to create an educational animation that illustrates the formation of a water molecule from oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Can you show two blue hydrogen atoms with positive signs coming together with one larger red oxygen atom marked with an 'O' to form a water molecule? Once they are combined, can the molecule rotate and shrink to a smaller size before keeping it steady on the screen? Also, please make sure each step is clearly visible and takes a few seconds to complete so it's easy to understand what's happening.
